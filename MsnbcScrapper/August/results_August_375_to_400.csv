"Friday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.9.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fridays-campaign-8924-rcna165973,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * At his Mar-a-Lago news conference, Donald Trump insisted that his MAGA base represents “75% of the country.” In reality, the Republican didn’t quite reach 47% of the popular vote in 2020, and while in office, he spent four years struggling to get his approval rating up to 50%. * Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign is launching a seven-figure ad blitz targeting Latino voters in battleground states. NBC News reported that the ads, highlighting Harris as the daughter of an immigrant mother, will air in English and Spanish. * On a related note, since its founding in 1929, the League of United Latin American Citizens has never before endorsed a presidential candidate. LULAC has nevertheless thrown its backing behind the Harris ticket. * The Harris-Walz campaign has also released a new ad, titled “Knows,” emphasizing the Democratic candidate’s working-class background, and a spot titled “Tougher” on her border-security work. * In Arizona, the latest HighGround Public Affairs survey found Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego with an 11-point lead over Republican conspiracy theorist Kari Lake in their U.S. Senate race. The same poll also showed Harris narrowly leading Trump in the Grand Canyon State. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * Speaking of battleground state polling, the latest statewide survey in Georgia, conducted by the AARP, found Harris and Trump tied, with each garnering 48% support. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * NBC News reports that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s independent expenditure arm is launching its first attack in the Montana Senate race, targeting Republican Tim Sheehy over public lands. * And speaking of Montana, Trump is headed to Big Sky Country for a campaign event — instead of a more traditional and competitive battleground state — in part because of a personal vendetta the former president is waging against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. It’s worth emphasizing for context, however, that Trump also waged a personal vendetta against the Montana farmer six years ago, and Tester narrowly won re-election anyway."
"In the debate over the debates, Trump blinks under pressure",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 8:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/debate-debates-trump-blinks-pressure-rcna165960,"As recently as a week ago, Donald Trump and his team had made a categorical decision: The Republican would not participate in a Sept. 10 presidential debate to be hosted on ABC. Team Trump had originally agreed to participate in the event, but as of seven days ago, the GOP nominee and his political operation had changed their minds. In fact, they presented a relatively detailed case explaining their decision to back away from the original commitment, citing Trump’s ongoing litigation against ABC and network anchor George Stephanopoulos, which dovetailed with the former president’s incessant whining — online and in conservative media interviews — about the network. Trump instead said he would only agree to debate on Fox News — at a time of his choosing, in a location of his choosing, and with the kind of in-venue audience that makes him happy. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping when President Joe Biden was still running, the Republican posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” And then he blinked. The Associated Press reported: In other words, over the course of a few months, Team Trump agreed to the ABC debate, then backed out of the ABC debate, then caved under pressure and re-agreed to the ABC debate. In the process, the former president also expressed interest in two other debates — not including a possible event for the vice presidential candidates — though during his news conference he flubbed the dates while pointing to debates that haven’t yet been negotiated and might not occur. As for why, exactly, Trump spent weeks backing away from sharing a stage with Harris, only to have a sudden change of heart, I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s thinking, but it’s hard not to notice the parallels between the GOP nominee’s thinking this week and Biden’s thinking months ago: The incumbent wanted to shake up the 2024 race, so he agreed to debate his rival. Months later, it’s Trump who suddenly feels the need to shake up the campaign, so he agreed to reverse course on debating his rival. The Republican declared at his Mar-a-Lago news conference, “I haven’t recalibrated strategy at all.” His debate strategy suggests otherwise."
Trump doesn’t recall Jan. 6 and the transition of power as well as he should,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-doesnt-recall-jan-6-transition-power-well-rcna165950,"No human being should care as much about crowd sizes as Donald Trump, who has spent years obsessing over how many people show up to hear him talk. Lately, however, it’s been worse — not just because of the former president’s narcissism, but also because some impressive audiences have started showing up to Kamala Harris’ rallies. It’s apparently driving the Republican nominee a little batty. At his long, rambling Mar-a-Lago news conference, for example, after a reporter brought up the Democrat’s crowds, a visibly displeased Trump said his crowds are up to “30 times” larger than Harris’. The arithmetic reinforced just how unintentionally amusing the misplaced boast was: The public is apparently supposed to believe that if 10,000 people show up for a Harris event, it might seem impressive, but not when compared with the 300,000 imaginary people who’ve shown up for a Trump event. Of particular interest to the GOP candidate, however, was the crowd on hand to hear his Jan. 6 lies ahead of the assault on the U.S. Capitol. After going on and on for a while about how impressed he was with his Jan. 6 audience — he has insisted repeatedly in recent years that the crowd size that day is what really matters — Trump apparently thought it’d be a good idea to draw a comparison to a major historical event. “If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours — same real estate, same everything — same number of people. If not, we had more,” the former president said at his news conference. “And they said he had a million people but I had 25,000 people.” He chuckled. “But when you look at the exact same picture and everything’s the same because it was — the fountains, the whole thing all the way back to, from Lincoln to Washington, and you look at it and you look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd — we actually had more people.” None of this was even remotely true. Trump apparently didn’t care. What’s more, as part of the same set of remarks, the former president added: “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6.” That wasn’t true, either. But perhaps the most striking lie was Trump’s comments on the transfer of power. The Associated Press reported: It’d be great if that were true. It wasn’t. Not only did an insurrectionist mob, fueled by Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, attack the Capitol two weeks before Inauguration Day, but as the defeated Republican grudgingly exited the White House — refusing to attend his successor’s swearing-in — military personnel and police officers patrolled the streets of Washington, fearing additional potential violence from Trump’s followers. I’m reminded of remarks former Rep. Liz Cheney delivered in June 2022, as the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee began its public hearings, and the Wyoming Republican made an appeal to the public. “Remember the men and women who have fought and died so that we can live under the rule of law, not the rule of men,” Cheney said. “I ask you to think of the scene in our Capitol rotunda on the night of Jan. 6. There, in, a sacred space in our constitutional republic, the place where our presidents lie in state, watched over by statues of Washington and Jefferson, Lincoln and Grant, Eisenhower, Ford and Reagan, against every wall that night encircling the room, there were SWAT teams, men and women in tactical gear with long guns deployed inside our Capitol building. “There in the rotunda, these brave men and women rested beneath paintings depicting the earliest scenes of our Republic, including one painted in 1824 depicting George Washington resigning his commission, voluntarily relinquishing power, handing control of the Continental Army back to Congress. With this noble act, Washington set the indispensable example of the peaceful transfer of power. What President Reagan called, ‘nothing less than a miracle.’ The sacred obligation to defend this peaceful transfer of power has been honored by every American president — except one.”"
"On Biden’s retirement, Trump flubs meaning of ‘unconstitutional’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 6:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joe-biden-retirement-trump-flubs-unconstitutional-election-2024-rcna165935,"The first sign of trouble came last week. Donald Trump, complaining about President Joe Biden’s retirement, argued by way of his social media platform that Democrats were “Unconstitutionally” nominating someone new for the party’s 2024 ballot. On Tuesday, the Republican repeated the line, arguing that Democratic Party leaders “Unconstitutionally” took the incumbent’s candidacy away from him. (Why Trump capitalizes the word unnecessarily is unclear, though he’s long adopted his own idiosyncratic approach to grammatical rules.) At his long, rambling Mar-a-Lago press conference, the GOP nominee returned to the subject, suggesting that Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 nomination is, you guessed it, “unconstitutional.” After claiming that Harris was secretly in league with a Democratic cabal that pushed Biden to end his candidacy — an assertion he made up out of whole cloth — Trump said: It’s difficult to say from a distance whether Trump was genuinely confused about recent events or was simply hoping to deceive the public, but he was combining events from two different election cycles. His argument, in effect, was that Harris shouldn’t be the Democratic nominee in 2024 because her 2020 candidacy fell far short, which is every bit as absurd as it seems. But it was his use of the word “unconstitutional” that stood out. Whether the former president realizes this or not, the U.S. Constitution is silent on the matter of party nomination processes. Biden was free to retire voluntarily; he was free to endorse his vice president as his successor; Harris was free to seek her party’s nomination; and Democrats were free to choose her to lead the party’s ticket. Not only were these events in line with federal election law, the idea that the U.S. Constitution somehow prohibits the developments is ridiculous. Trump was nevertheless proud of the comments and promoted a video of his comments on his online platform. Or put another way, instead of being embarrassed by talking about constitutional law in an incoherent way, the Republican seemed eager to flaunt his ignorance. Making matters worse, there’s a larger pattern to consider. In 2019, Trump didn’t like the U.S. House’s impeachment process, so he labeled it “unconstitutional.” In 2023, Trump condemned automatic voter registration, so he labeled it “unconstitutional,” too. Around the same time, the former president said court-imposed gag orders on criminal suspects were “unconstitutional,” and the FBI executing a court-approved search warrant at his glorified country club was “unconstitutional,” too. What voters are confronting, in other words, is a politician who appears to have convinced himself that “unconstitutional” and “stuff that bothers me” are synonymous. They’re not."
"On targeting Hillary Clinton, Trump isn’t done rewriting history",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-hillary-clinton-trump-isnt-done-rewriting-history-rcna165924,"The list of lies Donald Trump told during his long and meandering Mar-a-Lago press conference isn’t short, but NBC News highlighted one of the most striking: the former president’s rhetoric about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As part of the same remarks, the Republican nominee said Clinton — who, as a former senator and Cabinet secretary, was more than simply the wife of a former president — was “pretty evil,” but in Trump’s version of events, he nevertheless responded to “lock her up” chants by telling his followers, “Just relax, please. We won the election.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that it was rather creepy to hear Trump declare that he could have “done things” to Clinton “that would have made your head spin.” Instead, let’s consider the underlying point of the rhetoric. The subject is on my mind in part because I talk about this in my new book — which comes out in just a few days — but Trump is rewriting history with a specific goal in mind. In the GOP candidate’s counternarrative, he was “very protective” of his 2016 rival after the election, in part because of his deep commitment to propriety, and in part because he believed it was wrong to use the levers of governmental power to pursue a political rival. As part of the same story — a counternarrative he’s pushed before — voters are also supposed to believe that those rascally Democrats, however, abandoned these principles and prosecuted him after his 2020 defeat, failing to follow the magnanimous example he established a few years earlier. There’s just one fairly obvious problem: Trump’s version of reality is utterly bonkers. As regular readers know, Trump publicly and privately begged prosecutors to charge Clinton. Ahead of Election Day 2020 — nearly four years after Clinton’s defeat — the then-Republican president again publicly called for the Democrat’s incarceration and lobbied then-Attorney General Barr to prosecute the former secretary of state for reasons unknown. None of this was kept secret. It happened out in the open. We all saw it play out in public — all of which makes it a strange thing for the GOP presidential nominee to keep lying about. As for the idea that Trump was uncomfortable with his followers’ “lock her up” chants, and he graciously told them to “just relax,” reality tells a very different story. He not only spent four years in the White House trying to prosecute Clinton — the opposite of “relaxing” — a recent Washington Post report noted, there are ""several instances in which Trump called explicitly for Clinton’s jailing and others in which he agreed with his supporters’ chants.” What’s more, it’s also worth emphasizing for context that Clinton didn’t deserve to be prosecuted, because there was no evidence of her committing any crimes. A jury, on the other hand, recently examined evidence and found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. To be sure, I understand why the former president is trying to rewrite history. Trump now wants the public to believe he took the high road against his former rivals, unlike those Democratic meanies who insist on holding him accountable. In reality, however, Trump desperately tried to weaponize federal law enforcement against his perceived foes — especially Clinton. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Georgia’s election board is out of control. Can anything be done?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/georgia-election-board-trump-2020-fulton-county-rcna165670,"On Tuesday night, as Democrats cheered Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's debut as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, something considerably less joyful was going down in Atlanta. As my colleague Ja'han Jones explained, Georgia's State Election Board, a five-member body controlled by fervent Donald Trump loyalists, adopted a rule allowing local election boards to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" before certifying election results — a task that, pursuant to Georgia statutory law, has long been understood to be mandatory and ministerial. The State Election Board failed to define what constitutes a ""reasonable inquiry"" and suggested — again, in contrast to plain language in Georgia law requiring counties to certify this year's election results by Nov. 12 — that such inquiries could justify failing to certify by that date (or any specific date). But it gets worse. As good government types and local Democrats sputtered, the Georgia election board wasn't quite done. Instead, it met again Wednesday because its very newsy vote Tuesday night meant other agenda items went unaddressed. And at Wednesday's meeting, the board revived a State Election Board complaint known as SEB 2023-025. That complaint alleges ballot tabulation improprieties, including the double counting of roughly 3,000 ballots, in Fulton County during the November 2020 presidential election. In May, the board voted to resolve that complaint by reprimanding Fulton County for such errors and appointing independent election monitors for the upcoming general election. (It's worth noting the double counting, though never conclusively determined, wouldn’t have impacted the outcome of the election.) Yet on Wednesday, despite strenuous objections from the board's chair, John Fervier (an appointee of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican and a Trump foe), and the board's lone Democrat, Sara Tindall Ghazal, the three remaining members reopened that complaint and approved referring it to Georgia's attorney general, Chris Carr. Trump praised those three members for their ""courage"" over the weekend. And lest you think Wednesday's proceedings were too granular for the former president, he indeed was paying attention: Trump not only reposted a six-plus-minute video of the vote and related discussion to Truth Social, but insisted that Carr, Kemp and GOP Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ""MUST get moving on this"" because ""[w]e can't let this happen again. WE MUST WIN GEORGIA IN 2024!!!"" Unsaid, of course, was how yet another investigation of alleged errors in Fulton County's conduct of the 2020 election — none of which would have changed the outcome — relate to the fight for Georgia's electoral votes this year. Nonetheless, focusing solely or mostly on Trump's reaction misses the real danger in how Georgia's State Election Board is conducting itself. During the clip Trump shared, one of the members he has praised, Janelle King, reacted to Fervier's repeat warnings that the board's actions might run counter to state law. For example, according to public reporting, the Georgia attorney general's office — which has now been charged with conducting a new investigation — had advised Fervier that reopening the complaint would itself be unlawful. A source close to the board confirms that Carr's office provided such guidance through a written memo in June. King is a recent addition to the board, chosen after her predecessor, Ed Lindsey, opposed ending no-excuse mail-in voting and then voted against referring the Fulton County complaint to the state attorney general in May. He abruptly resigned on May 15, Rolling Stone reported, leading to King's selection. Thus, one might think that given her relative inexperience, King might reflect on Fervier's concerns with care. Instead, she scoffed, proclaiming that if the meeting were a drinking game and the members each had to drink each time he said that, they’d have been wasted. And then, drunk only on fidelity to Trump, she insisted that irrespective of the law, referring the complaint to the state attorney general was the right thing to do. One last thing: You might be wondering where Raffensperger is in all of this. After all, as Georgia's secretary of state, the administration of the state's elections falls squarely in his domain. In fact, it's precisely because of that domain that Raffensperger — who resisted Trump's infamous Jan. 2, 2021, plea to ""find 11,780 votes"" — fell out with Trump four years ago. The answer is, nowhere — but hardly by Raffensperger's own choice. Following the 2020 election, the Georgia Legislature removed him as a voting member of the Georgia election board. Then, during this past legislative session, they passed legislation ejecting Raffensperger from the board entirely and authorizing the board to investigate him. Nonetheless, Raffensperger continues to focus on real election security measures. While the Georgia election board appeared to flout state law, Raffensperger partnered Wednesday with the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to host a “tabletop exercise” for local election and IT officials to ensure the physical and cybersecurity of the vote in Georgia this November. It's clear, with under 90 days to go before the 2024 general election, that something is amiss in Georgia election administration. But it's not the results of the 2020 election, the conduct of Fulton County, or the actions of Trump's favorite Peach State punching bag, Brad Raffensperger. Rather, the State Election Board is out of control — and it could be that only litigation will stop it from disenfranchising its own citizens. Watch this space."
Why Tim Walz’s progressive policies appeal to both urban and rural America,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-harris-progressive-policies-minnesota-rcna165883,"“Thank you, Madame Vice President, for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy.” That’s how Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota began his first speech as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, the latest development in a seismic two-and-a-half weeks in American politics. This week, thousands gathered in Philadelphia to see Harris and Walz introduce themselves as a ticket.  They cheered for the governor’s zingers and heaped praise upon Harris, nearly blowing the roof off Temple University’s Liacouras Center with the rallying cry, “We’re not going back.” In the City of Brotherly Love, it soon became evident the joy Walz was talking about: the joy of a party that had found its footing after a contentious and, at times, bitterly divided month. A party that had coalesced into a singular force with a unified purpose: defeating Donald Trump in 90 days. As the first “Harris-Walz” branding was still rolling off the presses, political heavy-hitters of all stripes praised Harris’ pick.  Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called it an “excellent” decision. Joe Manchin, the independent (formerly Democratic) senator from West Virginia, said Walz would “bring normality back to the most chaotic political environment that most of us have ever seen.” Even Larry Hogan, the former Republican governor of Maryland who’s running for the U.S. Senate, praised Walz’s “dedication to public service.” Though former President Donald Trump’s campaign insisted Walz would “UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH,” Trump himself appointed Walz in 2019 to serve on the Council of Governors, a bipartisan advisory group that consists of five Democratic and five Republican governors. And ABC News recently unearthed audio of Trump praising the governor’s handling of the 2020 George Floyd protests. Though Twitter isn’t necessarily real life, social media platforms brimmed with praise for Walz, including playful memes and musings that if Harris is “Brat,” Walz is “Midwest Princess.” It’s impressive considering that this time last month, Walz was a virtual unknown outside of Minnesota. A Marist poll released Tuesday found that 71% of Americans had never heard of him. That’s despite a consequential five years as governor and six terms in Congress, where at one point he was rated the seventh most bipartisan member of the 435-member body. But Walz’s unifying ability didn’t begin when Harris chose him as her running mate. Even with a narrow Democratic majority in his state’s Legislature, Walz has managed to enact a host of progressive policies in Minnesota without alienating his rural constituents. He’s secured child tax credits and paid family leave for Minnesotans. He was the first governor to sign abortion rights into law after the fall of Roe v. Wade. He’s championed the safety of trans kids. He’s made roads safer by ensuring undocumented immigrants are eligible for driver's licenses. But nowhere are Walz’s progressive bona fides more evident than his education policy, likely because Walz was a teacher. While Republican governors like Arkansas’ Sarah Huckabee Sanders were signing bills to roll back child labor regulations, Walz was literally embraced by elementary students as he signed a bill ensuring them free breakfast and lunch on school days. Republicans have complained that Walz ensured free menstrual products in student bathrooms (the horror!), but conveniently omit that the policy was secured as part of a $2.2 billion education spending package he signed last year, averaging to $400 in extra funds per student, one of the largest education investments in Minnesota history. These investments don’t stop with grade school. In just a few months, graduating Minnesota students will begin reaping the benefits of North Star Promise, a program Walz signed into law that covers public college tuition and fees for families making under $80,000 thousand a year, regardless of immigration status. Walz seems to realize that even the most divisive policy proposals become popular if they result in tangible benefits. Long gone is the “death panel” fearmongering around the Affordable Care Act; now it enjoys a 62% approval rating, according to KFF, and sees record signups year after year. Opponents of same-sex marriage vowed it would lead to the breakdown of society, but nearly 10 years after marriage equality became law of the land, a Gallup poll found 69% of Americans support it without a second thought. This might be the secret sauce to Walz’s big tent: improvements to people’s lives guided by an appeal to our better natures. Maybe the key to the Harris-Walz campaign’s momentum — and the key to Democrats keeping the White House — lies in bringing back sanity, and with it, the joy.

Donald Trump is struggling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-news-conference-kamabla-harris-rcna165636,"Former President Donald Trump is struggling. It’s been evident for weeks now. The glow hadn’t yet faded on his triumphant performance at the Republican National Convention when President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Since then, Trump has had to face a resurgent opponent with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. And, friends, let me tell you, he is not happy about it. Most infuriating to Trump is his campaign being in a position it has rarely been in: chasing the spotlight. Rather than setting the media’s agenda every day, he’s been forced to watch as Harris has sucked up all the oxygen in the room. The horrible rollout of his own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has only highlighted how energized Democratic voters have become. Worst of all for Trump, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have been drawing massive crowds, a fact that had Trump fuming at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday. Trump hasn’t been doing himself many favors in this post-Biden campaign. While Harris and Walz are crisscrossing six swing states introducing themselves this week, Trump is mostly off the campaign trail. His sudden decision to hold a press event was a clear attempt to draw the focus back to himself, an attempt that will likely prove to be less effective than it’s been in the past. The problem is that Trump and his campaign spent the last several years preparing to run against Biden and are having difficulty shifting gears, despite having reportedly laid some groundwork to face Harris ahead of the swap. This new reality hasn’t set well with Trump at all, who complained (incorrectly) at his news conference that it’s unconstitutional for Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. It appears that, without Biden as a foil, candidate Trump no longer knows who he is. In a sign that everything is totally cool and normal with him, Trump launched into a bit of Biden fanfiction on TruthSocial earlier this week, speculating that the president might try to seize back the nomination at the Democratic National Convention this month. It doesn’t help that the Trump campaign hasn’t landed on an effective message to deploy against Harris beyond the boilerplate anti-Democrat language that typifies the Trump era. (Soft on crime, bad on the border, secretly a communist — you know the drill.) Without a firm strategy in place, we see Trump trying to find something — anything — that works. In the truest to form example, his attack against Harris’ mixed-race background during his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week was reportedly unplanned — and has already fizzled out as a talking point. In his desperation, Trump has also been cycling through potential nicknames for Harris, trying out “Laffin’ Kamala” and “Crazy Kamala” before landing on the baffling choice of “Kamabla.” It’s a choice that’s confusing and unlikely to have any impact on the perception of Harris. It could be a racist dog whistle; it could be a play on the word “blah” to imply that she’s boring; it may be both or neither. (Anyone else old enough to remember former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., clarifying he was talking about “blah” people on welfare, not “Black” people, in a speech?) Trump's outbursts have prompted his staff to run with the ball, like when they threw up projections at a subsequent rally that highlighted Harris’ Indian heritage. The same is true for “Kamabla,” despite it being objective nonsense. HuffPost reporter S.V. Dáte hit up a senior campaign official to ask what it means, the staffer repeatedly only responded with “Kamabla.” See also: This entirely unhelpful X post from Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung: Embracing “Kamabla” is likely to be more about hoping the base joins in on the evident trolling of the libs than any real understanding of what the heck Trump really means. But it’s clearly far from what the campaign and Trump’s closest surrogates wanted him to be doing. As The New York Times put it, “many in Mr. Trump’s party find this all to be counterproductive, to say the least.” It’s a situation that ironically has him “asking friends and allies how his campaign staff is doing — a question that some say could lead to staff changes,” The Washington Post reported. But if we’re being honest, his inability to be anyone other than himself, no matter how much it would benefit him, is a given at this point. Same with the affinity for pithy nicknames thing — it’s something that we’ve come to expect from Trump. These things are baked into his political persona by now, and we’re seeing a repeat of the same old shtick he’s been performing since 2016. In other words, what we’re seeing is Trump hunkering down in his comfort zone, returning to the tricks that have become tropes. It’s wild to realize that what was once shocking from him has become rote, pedestrian even. It’s a feeling that Sid Blumenthal captured in The Guardian when he compared Trump to Laurence Olivier’s character in “The Entertainer,” a man “desperately trying to float his act, shamelessly manipulating and trampling everybody, but incapable of performing anything but the old numbers before a bored audience.” That already threatened to be the case back in 2020, when I noted that Trump was trying to make a shot-by-shot remake of his first campaign. Four years later, he was hoping to try to do the exact same before Harris completely upended that plan. Now, having been denied the rematch that he wanted, Trump is the only one left feeling stale."
Trump and his allies are previewing their election sabotage plan in Georgia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 4:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/georgia-election-board-trump-certification-rcna165784,"Obscure, unelected state government panels aren’t usually a hot election topic. But the Georgia State Election Board has drawn well-deserved national attention with its outrageous actions on Tuesday to pass antidemocratic changes to the battleground state’s election rules. It has provided fodder for Donald Trump, earning sharply partisan praise at his recent Atlanta rally. Now Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp should reverse its rogue actions.  The board used to be a sleepy bipartisan backwater that kept well away from controversy. But earlier this year, the GOP-controlled state Legislature appointed two new members to the five-person panel, transforming it into a Trump-aligned government body. Three of the board’s five members have expressed doubts that President Joe Biden won the state in the 2020 election. The board’s meetings have become a haven for false election conspiracy theories, many based on Trump’s 2020 election lies. Now the board’s MAGA majority is trying to change Georgia’s election rules just ahead of the contest. Its first attempt came last month, only to be reversed after a lawsuit accused the three members of holding an unlawful meeting to ram through the changes. This week, though, they resumed their headlong charge for the Republican nominee.  One of the two new rules passed by the board on Tuesday lets local elections officials halt vote-counting and delay or even outright refuse certification if they contend there are any irregularities, essentially making the certification of election results discretionary. (Georgia law states in multiple places that local election board officials shall perform their duties — meaning their duties are mandatory, not discretionary). Other proposed changes would increase workload demands on overburdened election workers, which could overwhelm county elections offices and ultimately slow down or stop certification. These eleventh-hour changes are supported by Republican Party officials, GOP operatives at the Republican National Committee and MAGA-connected ""election integrity"" activists. These include local elections officials and GOP officials who most likely believe Trump was cheated out of the 2020 election. And all this builds on similar efforts in 2020, when a Coffee County elections official delayed certification of Biden’s Georgia victory and refused to validate the recount results, citing MAGA-backed election conspiracies. The same official allegedly helped Trump campaign operatives breach Coffee County’s voting data days before Jan. 6. According to CNN, Coffee County was specifically cited in draft federal executive orders for seizing voting machines that were presented to Trump in a chaotic Oval Office meeting on Dec. 18, 2020. In the same meeting, Rudy Giuliani alluded to a plan to gain “voluntary access” to Georgia voting machines. The foundation for obstructing certification of the 2024 election results is being laid in Georgia. These newly passed rules changes, along with other proposed changes still being considered by the board, follow refusals from Republican county election board members in Georgia to certify election results in the 2023 local elections and the 2024 primary even though there is no legitimate doubts about the results. And it doesn’t stop there. After Fulton County’s 2024 primary, Fulton County Election Board member Julie Adams filed a suit challenging a badly needed law that prevents local officials from refusing certification. Adams is represented by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute and belongs to the Election Integrity Network, whose founder, Cleta Mitchell, joined Trump’s infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump’s 2020 election interference playbook hasn’t changed, but the MAGA operation has become more sophisticated. Now, there are election deniers holding local elections positions in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania (in addition to Georgia). GOP officials have resisted certifying results in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada.  But Georgia elections are facing an attack from Trump’s operation that seems more intense than any of its other efforts across the country. The state’s current lieutenant governor signed a certificate saying Trump won Georgia in 2020 and certifying himself as a false elector. After failing to overturn his 2020 loss, it seems Trump aims to win Georgia by any means, aided by the State Election Board. Trump may be hinting at this strategy, recently claiming he “didn’t need the votes,” an odd statement for a presidential candidate. Trump’s remarks could be a hint to the re-use of his operation’s 2020 playbook, only better planned and executed. The person best positioned to stop this is Gov. Brian Kemp. Though Kemp has continued to sign voter suppression bills inspired by Trump’s “big lie” into law, he received bipartisan praise for refusing to go along with Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Will Kemp step up again to defend Georgia’s elections from MAGA sabotage? Or will he continue to egg them on as he has in the past couple of Georgia’s legislative sessions?  Georgia law gives Kemp the authority to investigate members of the election board and remove and replace them if they’ve violated Georgia law, which it certainly seems they did by holding an unlawful meeting. Even though Kemp supports Trump’s run for president, he should agree: Trump must win Georgians’ votes fair and square. But the response doesn’t stop with the governor, of course. Others have an important role to play, as well. In the last presidential cycle, pro-democracy activists like Georgia’s Fair Fight (for which one of the co-authors, Groh-Wargo, serves as CEO) built voter protection operations in every crucial battleground state, exposed Trump’s callous voter suppression scheme and helped turn out the vote in 2020 that secured Biden’s Georgia win and delivered control of the U.S. Senate for Democrats. The pro-democracy ecosystem is once again working to protect voters’ ability to stay on the rolls, access the ballot, vote and have their votes counted in 2024. Voters are the last and ultimately most critical line of defense. The best way to ensure election results are certified in a timely manner is with large turnout and decisive margins. Voters everywhere should also check their voter registration status regularly and get their friends and family registered today. It’s also not too early to make a plan to vote, sign up to be a poll worker in your community or get involved with your state Democratic Party’s voter protection team. If we exercise our freedom to vote, we can stop the MAGA election sabotage scheme."
Debunking the GOP's lies about Tim Walz's military record,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fact-check-walz-military-record-swift-boat-rcna165863,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Every year, about 2 million Americans serve in the armed forces, either full time or one weekend a month. These people come from all walks of life and serve in different ways. Many serve as Sen. JD Vance of Ohio did. After high school, Vance signed up for a four-year enlistment in the Marines including six months in Iraq doing public affairs. Then he was honorably discharged.  That’s a bit of a rarity among politicians. Most served as officers after college, which means better pay and benefits. But there is an even rarer experience: Among the tiny fraction of Americans who enlist, a much smaller share make a career of it — serving 20 years or more, with multiple deployments. And only a small fraction of those stay in the service after being disabled on the job. One of them is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, an enlisted soldier in the National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century. A journey that began on a Nebraska farm as soon as he was eligible to join. “My father served during the Korean War. And the day after I turned 17, he took me down to an Army National Guard recruiter and I raised my hand and signed up,” Walz said of his enlistment. That was in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was president. Walz continued to serve for the next 24 years under four commanders in chief. He spent most of that time as an artillery soldier, which took a toll on his hearing. In 2002, after Walz had already done 20 years and qualified for retirement, a medical board considered discharging him because of his hearing loss. Instead, he convinced them to let him complete his final enlistment, which began after 9/11.  Walz achieved theh highest enlisted rank in the Army, command sergeant major. But rather than stay in and complete the schooling for that rank, he retired in 2005 at the rank of master sergeant. In part, he says, because he wanted to speak freely about political injustices, including the Iraq War. The following year, he was one of more than 60 anti-war veterans running for Congress as the “Fighting Dems,” a group that included Sen. Tammy Duckworth, now former Sen. Jim Webb and now former Rep. Patrick Murphy. Following his surprise victory in a traditionally conservative district, Walz became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress. There he worked to help end the military’s anti-gay “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. After Donald Trump was elected president, Walz became the ranking Democrat on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he fought the White House over privatizing veterans’ health care. He also used his own experiences with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to help other veterans get their benefits. Walz’s experience in the armed forces is an atypical one for most Americans, and particularly for politicians. There’s literally no one like him. But now that Walz is running with Vice President Kamala Harris against Trump and Vance, Republicans are trying to “Swift-boat” him — denigrating his service the way they did with Vietnam veteran John Kerry 20 years ago. They claim Walz stole valor and left the Army to avoid going to Iraq. It’s a playbook Republicans also used against Walz when he ran for governor of Minnesota. And it failed then. As it turns out, when voters hear about the quarter century Walz spent as a citizen soldier and the time he has spent since, fighting for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to get the benefits they deserve, they don’t see what Republicans do.  Instead, they see a rare kind of veteran in politics who can cut through the self-serving B.S., rather than adding to it.

Pro-Trump Republicans should think twice about ridiculing ‘Tampon Tim’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tampon-tim-walz-social-media-trump-team-rcna165810,"When I first saw the hashtag #TamponTim circulating on social media, I was excited. What high praise, I thought. As someone who has worked in menstrual equity for the past 15 years, I was grateful that Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was receiving recognition for the significant steps he’s taken to support menstrual equity, including eliminating the tampon tax and ensuring that free menstrual products are available in all public school bathrooms in Minnesota. The nickname, of course, was intended as a slight — spurred by fans of the Trump/Vance ticket as an attempt to ridicule men for standing up for women’s rights and menstrual equity and specifically to contort and promote the hypermasculine message coming from the GOP. But the truth is Gov. Walz’s actions are not just commendable; they are groundbreaking. By removing the tampon tax, he made Minnesota one of the few states to recognize the absurdity of taxing essential health products. Currently, 21 states still impose tampon taxes. The average menstruator spends about $13.25 per month on menstrual products, which amounts to over $6,000 in a lifetime. Eliminating the tampon tax can significantly reduce this financial burden and improve economic inequalities. Walz’s administration also implemented policies ensuring that menstrual products are freely available in public school bathrooms. This move is crucial for students who might experience their first periods unexpectedly or who cannot afford products at home. According to a 2019 study by Plan International USA, 1 in 5 girls in the U.S. has missed school because of lack of access to menstrual products. Period poverty is a real issue in the U.S. Providing free products in schools can help mitigate this issue.  Leaders who acknowledge these issues also help destigmatize menstruation and prevent shame and embarrassment for something that is so natural. These actions demonstrate a genuine commitment to supporting the well-being and dignity of all people who menstruate.  Walz’s push to put menstrual products in all gendered bathrooms is where this amusing, supposedly derogatory, nickname came from. But I really think the name should be embraced and celebrated. Walz’s progressive policies stand in stark contrast to the wave of regressive legislation sweeping across the U.S. Laws like Florida’s “Don’t Say Period” bill, which restricts discussions about menstruation in schools for students under 12, are a blatant attack on freedom and on speech, and are detrimental to the health and dignity of our young people — regardless of whether they bleed or not. In other states, there are moves to subpoena menstrual data, which has the potential to be weaponized against people in states where abortion access is restricted. These laws are not just invasive; they are dangerous. In 2022, Missouri and Florida lawmakers proposed bills to require the tracking of menstrual cycles for minors, raising significant concerns about the potential misuse of such data in states with restrictive abortion laws. Even though the bills have not passed, the initiatives behind them highlight the dangers of overregulating menstruation, which exacerbates a culture of shame and silence around menstruation. Such practices can have serious health and social consequences, underscoring the need for careful consideration of privacy and ethical implications. Unfortunately, periods have been used as a political football in other political fights. Specifically, the anti-trans, anti-abortion, anti-sex education and pro-religion-in-schools groups, which continually use the policing of periods as means to other ends. As a consequence, today there are more laws regulating periods in America than in other countries, highlighting a troubling trend. Walz is a rare example of a politician willing to take a stand for menstrual equity, and we need more like him. The current landscape of laws targeting menstruation is not just absurd; it is alarming.  For the past 15 years, the Desai Foundation, the programmatic nongovernmental organization that I run, has been working in menstrual equity across India and has seen firsthand the consequences of ignorance, debilitating stigmas, limited access to products and other aspects of menstrual equity that lead to impacts on health, reproductive health, education, economic empowerment and beyond.  It’s crucial to build a coalition of policymakers across the U.S. who understand that menstrual equity is a matter of basic human rights. As we look toward future elections, it is essential to remember that bleeders are voters. And there are a lot of them. Politicians who advocate for menstrual equity are likely to gain support from voters who prioritize health, gender equality and reproductive rights.  A 2021 survey by YouGov found that 60% of Americans support eliminating the tampon tax. Think about how that could translate to voters in a presidential election. There is widespread public support for policies that promote menstrual equity; we just need to talk about them more. Let’s encourage more of our representatives to earn nicknames like #TamponTim by supporting initiatives that make real differences in people’s lives and advance menstrual equity."
Desperate right-wingers accuse Tim Walz of being 'anti-white',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 2:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tim-walz-right-wing-attacks-anti-white-rcna165876,"Donald Trump’s campaign and the conservative movement have been grasping at straws trying to tar Kamala Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, since he joined her ticket this week. They have revived previously debunked allegations downplaying Walz’s 24 years of military service. And Trump has said Walz would “unleash hell” on the U.S. and denounced his handling as governor of Minnesota of the 2020 social justice protests — a claim that's undercut by recently unearthed audio in which Trump praised his handling of those protests.  So Republican influencers and media types are pushing another line of attack: claiming Walz secretly despises white people. Newsmax host Rob Schmitt, claiming to know Walz’s true motivations, said on Wednesday that Walz has been eager to “decimate the history of his own state to capitulate to a population of asylum-seekers in this country from Africa.” “Tim Walz is the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people,"" Schmitt argued. “That’s who Tim Walz is. We all know a guy like that. He’s the left-wing cancer that we can’t seem to cure in this country. He is the embodiment of that.” Right-wing activist Christopher Rufo posted a long thread on X suggesting that because Walz may have read Black authors, he's been inspired to “exclude whites from government programs.” That was a dubious characterization of Walz's commitment to distribute 50% of a government funding program to minority business owners. Rufo also retweeted a user who claimed Walz is a “self-hating white man” who’s “trying to be forgiven for his skin crime.” And during a recent appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, former Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota falsely claimed Walz signed a law that “infused all the school curriculum with wokeism” and mandated the teaching of what she called a “George Floyd hate whitey curriculum.” She added, ""Everything is about race. It’s 'hate white people, white people are evil.' And that’s in all of the curriculum.” In reality, Walz signed a law this year that prohibited school libraries from banning a book “based solely on its viewpoint or the messages, ideas, or opinions it conveys,” a counter to Republican efforts to ban books about systemic racism and inequality. That law still allows schools to restrict access to books over ""legitimate"" concerns about appropriateness. These are some of the scare tactics right-wing influencers and media are using, trying to portray a white man who’s shown concern for marginalized people as some sort of menacing, anti-white race traitor. This is a tactic that's been deployed against white Americans who’ve opposed racism in the past. But aside from exposing those who make such claims as bigots, it also makes them look flat-out bizarre. As the Harris campaign continues to make the case to voters that its opponents are “weird,” in plain speak, Republicans can't seem to resist embracing the toxic rhetoric of the darkest right-wing fringe."

Packed Harris-Walz campaign rallies likely to rattle crowd-size-obsessed Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 1:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/trump-vance-harris-walz-crowd-size-rcna165823,"This is an adapted excerpt of the Aug. 8 episode of ""Morning Joe."" The recent attacks from Republicans targeting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military career are just a small part of a much larger theme within the Trump-Vance campaign — a campaign that feasts on dishonesty and disinformation.  They do that to deflect from a record where the cruelty, the violence, the antidemocratic values, the disrespect for our Constitution is the entire point. That’s who they are and that’s what they want to distract from. And to do so, they are trying to tear two very positive, joyful and energetic people down.  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are riding a high right now. Their best strategy is just to keep moving forward and deflect the disinformation that comes their way. But they also need to embrace the joy — which you see them doing.  Just look at the crowds they’re attracting. There has been a burst of energy and enthusiasm. You have people waiting out in the hot sun for hours. When you have to move a rally to an airport hangar, and that’s not even big enough, you’re onto something. Harris isn’t on a roll just with her vice presidential pick, it’s her entire campaign. We know Donald Trump depends on crowd size for his own sense of value. We saw that from his very first event as president, his inauguration, where he had to lie about it. Clearly crowd size is very important to the former president, so what we’re seeing from Harris and Walz will, no doubt, be very scary to the Trump campaign moving forward. And it doesn’t look like their crowds will be getting smaller anytime soon."
What special counsel David Weiss wants to show at Hunter Biden's tax trial,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 1:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/hunter-biden-tax-trial-california-rcna165819,"UPDATE (Thursday, Sept. 5, 2024, 5:06 p.m. ET): Hunter Biden on Thursday pleaded guilty to all nine charges against him in his federal criminal tax case. He initially pleaded not guilty in the case earlier this year. The criminal tax case against Hunter Biden is taking shape ahead of his trial set for next month, with a new court filing providing insight into special counsel David Weiss’ approach.  According to that filing — part of a flurry of pretrial litigation — federal prosecutors want to introduce testimony from an associate with whom, they say, the defendant agreed to help a Romanian businessman contest bribery charges in Romania. Prosecutors say they expect that evidence will show Biden and the associate “received compensation from a foreign principal who was attempting to influence U.S. policy and public opinion and cause the United States to investigate the Romanian investigation.” Prosecutors also want to introduce evidence of Biden’s business dealings with a Chinese energy conglomerate and his compensation for his position on the board of a Ukrainian energy industrial conglomerate. “This evidence will not include evidence that the defendant performed lobbying activity in exchange for this compensation,” prosecutors wrote. “Rather,” they said, “the evidence will show the defendant performed almost no work in exchange for the millions of dollars he received from these entities.” The government filing comes in response to the defense request that the judge exclude allegations of improper political influence or corruption — including any allegations that Biden acted on behalf of a foreign principal to influence U.S. policy or public opinion. His lawyers cited a federal rule that bars one side from introducing unfairly prejudicial evidence against the other. “None of these alleged crimes involve evidence or testimony relating to conspiracy theories about Mr. Biden’s supposed improper political influence and/or corruption, and such evidence or testimony is wholly irrelevant in this case,” they previously wrote to U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in California, who’s presiding over the tax case. In June, the president’s son was found guilty in the separate gun trial prosecuted by Weiss’ team in Delaware, where he is due to be sentenced in November.  When it comes to Biden’s request to exclude allegations of acting on behalf of a foreign principal, prosecutors responded that Biden “did receive compensation from a foreign principal to attempt to influence U.S. policy and public opinion, as alleged in the indictment, and this evidence is relevant and not unfairly prejudicial.” Arguments over what evidence can be introduced at trial happen in every criminal case, though here that exercise is playing out in the extraordinary prosecution of the sitting president’s son. Generally speaking, defendants want to narrow the prosecution’s evidence to make it harder to carry the heavy burden of proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors, meanwhile, want to paint broadly, to tell what they see as the full story surrounding a defendant’s alleged criminality. That full story can involve unsavory elements, which is seemingly what Biden’s lawyers want to prevent. The extent to which they succeed on that score remains to be seen, but the defense may have a difficult task ahead.

JD Vance’s texting relationship with fringe voice comes into view,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-texting-relationship-fringe-voice-comes-view-rcna165866,"For those unfamiliar with Charles Johnson, this week’s Washington Post report on his texting relationship with Sen. JD Vance might not have had a significant impact, but the closer one looks at the details, the worse the story appears. At first blush, some readers are probably shrugging their shoulders. A far-right senator texting with a far-right media personality? This must happen all of the time. But Johnson isn’t just some random conservative blogger. A Semafor report described him as “a notorious Internet troll [whom] the Republican Jewish Coalition had labeled a ‘Holocaust denier.’” And when candidates for national office have texting relationships with someone like this, it’s worth paying attention to. A spokesperson for the senator told Politico this week that Johnson “spam texted” Vance, and the Ohio Republican “usually ignored him.” Similarly, Vance told Semafor, “He’s kind of a crazy person. He’s kind of pathetic, and I just largely ignored him.” This might also seem plausible. Just because some fringe figure obtained the cellphone number of a prominent GOP official doesn’t necessarily mean that the Republican officeholder actually interacted with the figure in a direct and meaningful way. The trouble, however, is that the Post’s reporting tells a very different kind of story. The Post’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that the texts reflected a senator “engaged in the kind of freewheeling communication ordinarily tightly controlled by congressional staff.” This reportedly included the Ohioan asking Johnson for his thoughts on alien spacecrafts, the Republican Party’s position on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. We can probably all think of people in our lives whom we’ve “largely ignored.” We also haven’t sent them a series of texts like these. The more reporting like this comes to light, the tougher it is for Vance to avoid the “weird” label he doesn’t appear to like."
Harris found a pitch-perfect response to the 'lock him up' chants at her rallies,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 12:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-lock-him-up-chants-rallies-rcna165822,"Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have adopted a smart strategy for handling her followers’ (rather ironic) calls for Donald Trump to be incarcerated.  At Harris’ rallies, her supporters have occasionally broken out into chants of “lock him up” when she references the various criminal proceedings against the former president. The chant seems to combine the irony of using the phrase popularized at Trump's rallies against the candidate who pushed false claims of criminality against Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, together with an expression of a very real desire to see Trump held accountable for his actions. But you may have noticed that Harris, a former prosecutor, has never encouraged the chant. Instead, she’s waited for it to die down before going on with her speech.  I suspect she’s done this primarily out of respect for the administration of justice. Even if she does happen to want to see Trump get prison time as a result of being found guilty on 34 felony counts, it wouldn’t be smart — politically or legally — for her to say so. And I suspect she doesn’t want her followers to appear as rabid as Trump’s, despite their conviction that he should go to prison over his criminal conviction.  So I’ve been impressed with how she's responded to these chants by reiterating that her campaign is about more than defeating Trump. “This campaign — our campaign — is not just a fight against Donald Trump,” she said at her rally in Philadelphia this week. “Our campaign — this campaign — is a fight for the future.” Harris put a different twist on that message when the “lock him up” chants broke out during her stump speeches in Wisconsin and Detroit on Wednesday, saying in both speeches, “The courts are going to handle that” and “We’re going to beat him in November.”  It’s a clever play, really. It places Harris above the fray but doesn’t diminish her followers’ energy. And it speaks to voters who may want something to motivate them this November other than accountability for Trump and his illiberalism. "
Noah Lyles cried in Tokyo. Here’s why he’s smiling so big in Paris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 8, 2024, 11:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rooting-noah-lyles-win-200m-mens-final-paris-rcna165272,"UPDATE (Aug. 8, 2024, 2:40 p.m. ET): Noah Lyles won the bronze medal in the 200 m finals with a time of 19.7 seconds. He finished behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Kenny Bednarek of the United States. An ironclad rule of sports journalism is that there’s no cheering in the press box. Sports journalists are to always exhibit neutrality. We’re human, though, and at times it’s impossible not to become a fan of individual athletes. And I’ll admit that when the men in the 200-meter final settle into their starting blocks Thursday, I’ll be in my living room, ready to cheer American Noah Lyles to victory. Already the 100-meter gold medalist after a thrilling, photo-finish race Sunday night, Lyles will be running to secure his second gold medal in Paris in the event that put him on the path to track and field greatness. On Aug. 4, 2021, in Tokyo, he won a bronze medal in the 200 meters, behind Canada’s Andre DeGrasse and American Kenny Bednarek. Lyles’ loss was one of the surprises of the meet, perhaps behind only Italy’s Marcell Jacobs’ shocking the hell out of the world with his 100-meter win. After that race, in the thick humidity of the mix zone under Tokyo Olympic Stadium, I became a fan. Lyles was spent. He was talking to print and online reporters after he’d already endured more than a dozen television and radio interviews. His initial aloofness gave way to a torrent of emotion, his disappointment at not winning. He cried. He apologized for crying. He expressed his sorrow that his younger brother, Josephus, the one he’d followed into track as a kid so they could be together, wasn’t in Tokyo competing. “This should be him,” he said. He shared more about his nearly lifelong journey with anxiety and depression and how the year leading into those Olympics had been the hardest of his life physically and mentally. A U.S.A. Track & Field media official offered to cut things short. He didn’t take the out. “Having a place where you can actually be OK with letting go of your fears and saying, ‘I am scared,’ because I’ve definitely said that quite a few times this year,” Lyles said. “It’s OK, you know? “I want other people to know that there’s a better way.” After Lyles won the 100-meter race in Paris on Sunday, he posted a message on social media: “I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!” Talking to us reporters under the stadium in Tokyo three years ago, Lyles was raw and vulnerable, in a way we’ve rarely seen from those in the public eye, in a way that we, for far too long, have told athletes, particularly male athletes, isn’t allowed. Thankfully, led in part by Lyles and gymnastics icon Simone Biles, that stigma seems to be melting away. If his tears over not winning the 200 in Tokyo were Lyles’ low point, everything since has propelled him higher and higher.  He has made it his mission to make track and field more popular in the States, in part by making the stadium walk-in photo opportunity, now common in other professional sports, a thing in his sport, too. He’s used it as a time to show off some personality and his fashion sense before showing out when the competition begins. With his big talk and his painted nails, he relishes the pre-meet meetings with media, sometimes poking at his competitors and even athletes outside his sport. He got the attention of NBA stars when he said last year at the world championships that it bothers him to hear the NBA’s title-winning team called world champions when 29 of the 30 teams are in the U.S. (the 30th is in Canada). While he is raising his own profile and chasing Jamaica’s Usain Bolt in the record book, other American track standouts could reap the benefits of the increased exposure. More than the walk-in photo-ops and the entertaining news conferences, however, Lyles knew that the real way to make himself a household name was to win what counts as the marquee event at every Olympics and perhaps across all sports: the men’s 100-meter gold and the accompanying title of “world’s fastest man.” Lyles had always included 100-meter races on his schedule (he has called the race his mistress, while the 200 meters is his wife), and he ran an impressive 9.86 at a Diamond League race in China in 2018. But he failed to secure a spot in the 100 meters when he finished seventh of eight runners in the final at the U.S. Olympic Trials in 2021. He announced last year that he would become world champion in both the 200 and the 100 meters in Budapest, Hungary. Given that his biggest liability in the 100 meters was — and remains — his block starts, it was a lofty goal. The 27-year-old, one of the rare track and field athletes to jump from high school to the pros, met that first goal: He won three golds in Budapest, surprising the field with his 10-meter victory, getting his third consecutive 200-meter world championship and joining with Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Brandon Carnes to win the 4x100-meter relay. The success only fueled him to match the feat at the Olympics. He got that 100-meter gold by the smallest of margins and still has his signature event on deck. The Americans are also the favorite in the relay, but after the disaster of Tokyo, where they didn’t even qualify for the medal race, the latest in a comedy of errors that hasn’t seen the U.S. win a medal in the men’s 4x100 since 2004 or a gold since 2000, it might not be a given. But from what we’ve seen of Lyles since that night in Tokyo, when he was despondent and bared his soul to a cadre of socially distanced strangers, it will be hard to bet against them. And hard not to cheer for him."
Trump’s ‘drill baby drill’ plan: The wrong answer to the right questions,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 9:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-drill-baby-drill-plan-wrong-answer-right-questions-rcna165805,"A few months ago, after a monthly unemployment report reached the public, a reporter asked Donald Trump about his jobs plan. “My plan for jobs is to drill baby drill, bring energy down,” the former president replied. That didn’t make any sense — oil drilling does not have a meaningful impact on unemployment — but the Republican didn’t seem to care. The exchange came to mind anew during Trump’s latest Fox News appearance. HuffPost reported on a question the GOP candidate heard from a voter at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota. After initially mentioning how popular he believes he is among those at the event, the next words out of Trump’s mouth were, “We are going to drill baby drill; we’re going to bring down the cost of energy. Energy’s what caused the worst inflation, I think, in the history of our country.” The comments were widely derided, and for good reason: Trump heard a good question, and he responded with a nonsensical answer. Right off the bat, it’s worth emphasizing that while recent inflation rates imposed a real burden on millions of Americans, the problem wasn’t close to being the worst inflation in American history. What’s more, the former president’s indifference to the substance of governing is the stuff of legend — it was the basis for much of my first book — and his latest rhetoric doesn’t help matters. Asked about his jobs plan, Trump pointed to oil drilling. Asked about housing affordability, Trump again pointed to oil drilling. It seems like only a matter of time before he starts saying “drill baby drill” in response to questions about health care and education, too. I realize the GOP nominee isn’t literally going to say, “I don’t have an actual policy agenda,” but he’s implicitly making that point clear. But perhaps most important of all is Trump’s apparent ignorance about the status quo when it comes to energy policy: We’re already drilling. In fact, the United States during the Biden-Harris administration has not only produced more energy than any other country on the planet, energy production in the United States under Biden-Harris has also reached an all-time high. And it’s not just oil. U.S. production of natural gas, solar, wind generation, and battery storage have also all reached record highs under the incumbent Democratic administration. The country, in other words, is already doing the one thing Trump sees as the magical solution to domestic challenges, leaving us with a straightforward question: Does he not know the truth, or is he counting on voters not to know the truth?"
Challenge to Walz-signed voting rights law rejected by Minnesota Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/walz-voting-rights-minnesota-supreme-court-rcna165762,"The Trump campaign — that is, the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, the Republican who was found guilty of felonies in one case and accused of them in three others — has attacked Tim Walz for supporting voting rights for people convicted of felonies. As it happens, the Minnesota Supreme Court just rejected a challenge to a law on the subject that was signed by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate.   The state’s top court on Wednesday did not rule on the merits of the Re-Enfranchisement Act, which took effect last year after Walz, the state’s Democratic governor, signed it into law. Instead, the state justices rejected the bid because it found no legal standing to bring the case. Individual taxpayers and the self-styled “election integrity” watchdog group to which they belong, the Minnesota Voters Alliance, argued that the new voting provision violated the state constitution and that it’s therefore illegal to use public funds to educate people about it. But the state justices said the challengers had no legal right to bring the claim, citing so-called taxpayer and associational standing. “We share the district court’s concern that granting taxpayer standing in this case ‘would render the very concept of taxpayer standing meaningless’ because ‘practically every law entails at least some public expenditure,’” state chief justice Natalie Hudson wrote for the court. “We can discern no principled limitation to the theory of taxpayer standing advanced by the Taxpayers that would prevent the concept of taxpayer standing from becoming meaningless by allowing parties to challenge substantive government acts that involve incidental expenditures,” Hudson continued, adding that taxpayers can’t “manufacture standing by pointing to expenditures that are incidental to implementing the law.” Because the taxpayers lacked standing, so too did their group, Hudson noted. If the concept of standing sounds familiar, it was on those grounds that the Supreme Court rejected the challenge to mifepristone this past term, because the anti-abortion doctors and groups in that case lacked a sufficient legal stake to complain. Likewise here, the legal doctrine effectively blocked a court challenge to voting as it did to abortion in the mifepristone case. In that Supreme Court case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s unanimous opinion recalled the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s refrain that the standing analysis asks: “What’s it to you?” Or, as Walz himself put it in another context recently: “Mind your own damn business.”   Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Louisiana officials defend the Ten Commandments by cheapening them,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 9:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/louisiana-ten-commandments-law-school-posters-rcna165440,"On Sunday, the members of my Baptist church in New Orleans recited our church covenant, a public declaration of the ways we’ll demonstrate our faith that includes a commitment to “religiously training our children.” Though we recite this covenant once a month, this particular Sunday’s recitation was different. We uttered those words while entering the era in which the state of Louisiana has taken that role of religious “training” upon itself. The Louisiana Legislature has decreed that, beginning this year, every classroom in every public school must prominently display the Ten Commandments. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who triumphantly signed the bill in June, said last month that the 20-year-old man who fired a rifle at former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania might not have done so if his classrooms had displayed the Ten Commandments. There’s no honest way to read the Bible — or any literature on human behavior — and reach such a conclusion. If anything, the Bible’s message is the opposite: that a commandment not to do something will be followed by people doing that forbidden thing. That’s not to say that the Ten Commandments are a provocation to do wrong, only that plenty of wrong has been done by those who’ve seen the Ten Commandments. One must ignore thousands of years of data to treat the Ten Commandments as a prophylactic against wrongdoing. But such illogic is typical of Landry, a former state attorney general. Yet the bigger issue for me — as someone who grew up in a denomination that is largely responsible for the existence of the First Amendment and as the father of a public-school student in Louisiana — is that the law wrongly gives the state a role in religious instruction. This gross overreach should offend not just Baptists, but anyone who professes to be guided by the Constitution and anyone who wants the government to leave them alone. And after the preposterous arguments made by Landry and Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill at a Monday news conference, even those who think the government should honor and promote their religious beliefs have reason to be upset. In providing a federal court examples of Ten Commandments posters that they say pass constitutional muster, Landry and Murrill trivialized the significance of the Ten Commandments by putting them on the same level as pop culture. A teacher would be adhering to the law and avoiding any kind of constitutional violation, Louisiana says in its court brief, by putting a photo of Charlton Heston playing Moses and holding the Ten Commandments on one side of a poster and a photo of Lin-Manuel Miranda playing Alexander Hamilton and the “Ten Duel Commandments” on the other side. Similarly, a teacher could put up a cartoon depiction of an electronic tablet (such as an iPad or Kindle Fire or Samsung Galaxy) referring to the Ten Commandments as “the original tablet.” They even made a Ten Commandments poster with a meme taken from the movie “Mean Girls” in which a character asks, “Why are you so obsessed with me?” According to the brief, a teacher could put headlines from stories about the ACLU fighting laws requiring the display of the Ten Commandments on such a poster and satisfy Louisiana law without offending the Constitution. Is it really Louisiana’s argument that posters such as these not only honor the Ten Commandments, but would also provide the moral instruction that would have deterred Trump’s would-be assassin? If so, would a poster that lists the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ten Crack Commandments” have done the trick, too? No posters have appeared in my daughter’s classrooms, and it’s unclear if any have appeared in classrooms across the state. Because the law gives schools until January to comply, school officials likely are waiting until the new year, especially as courts weigh a challenge to the law’s constitutionality. In that Monday news conference, Landry additionally attempted to defend the law by pointing out that it passed overwhelmingly and was supported by some Democrats. But the two parties in Louisiana have often coalesced around bad ideas, and this is no exception. Regardless, the share of lawmakers supporting a law has no bearing on its constitutionality. If every Louisiana lawmaker voted for it, that wouldn’t prevent a court from declaring it problematic. But Landry argues that legislative might makes right and that parents who don’t want the state forcing their children to see the Ten Commandments ought to just tell their children “not to look at them.” He said Monday, “I think we’ve forgotten in this country that democracy actually means majority rule.” There, Landry betrays his intentions. I doubt he believes that putting up posters of the Ten Commandments will deter mass shooters. I do believe he thinks that putting them up shows folks who’s in charge in Louisiana. That kind of belief in “majority rule” made 18th-century Baptists insist upon the prohibition against the establishment of religion that appears in the First Amendment. They knew that unchecked “majority rule” is incompatible with freedom — no matter how many lawmakers vote otherwise."

"Flunking self-awareness again, Trump bemoans ‘Pro Criminal Atmosphere’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/flunking-self-awareness-trump-bemoans-criminal-atmosphere-rcna165785,"After Gov. Tim Walz joined the Democrats’ 2024 ticket this week, Donald Trump’s campaign team wasted little time in targeting the Minnesotan with attacks that appeared pre-packaged. One part of the offensive, however, stood out. Walz, Team Trump told voters, has a record of “embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.” Putting aside the fact that the governor did, in fact, restore voting rights for formerly incarcerated people — a popular and just position — the line of attack flunked a rather obvious test of self-awareness: A jury recently found the former president guilty of 34 felonies. The press release from Team Trump was intended to make it seem as if Walz has somehow been soft on criminals, which might’ve been more sensible if Trump weren’t already a criminal. Thursday morning — just two days after extensive coverage of his campaign’s misstep on Monday — the former president made the same self-defeating mistake. In a message published to his social media platform, Trump wrote: This was not an isolated comment. The GOP candidate recently declared with confidence at a public event, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” the Republican nominee said. “They generally stay a criminal, and we do not have time to figure it out.” This need not be complicated. A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. He's also still facing several dozen other pending felony counts, across multiple jurisdictions. If it's effectively impossible to “teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” he should probably drop out of the 2024 race immediately. What’s more, the former president has also surrounded himself with other criminals. “With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley recently noted. “With Trump, you have a team of felons.” In case that weren’t quite enough, during his failed presidency, Trump had a habit of issuing scandalous pardons to politically aligned criminals, and if elected to a second term, the Republican has promised to issue even more pardons to politically aligned criminals — including those who violently clashed with police officers. If Trump is looking for evidence of an actual “pro-criminal atmosphere,” he can actually find one in his own political operation. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Trump, Vance pick a fight over antisemitism they can’t win",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 7:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-pick-fight-antisemitism-cant-win-rcna165767,"Almost immediately after Vice President Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Donald Trump thought it’d be a good idea to falsely accuse her of antisemitism. Harris, the Republican said, is “totally against the Jewish people” — which was a curious claim about someone with a Jewish husband. But this week, the ugly offensive managed to get considerably worse. Before Harris announced her 2024 running mate, GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance said that if the Democrat didn’t choose Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, it would be “out of antisemitism.” After Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the ticket, the Republicans’ antisemitism smear reached new heights. If the vice president seriously considered a Jewish running mate before ultimately settling on one of his rivals, the right argued, then clearly Harris and her party have a problem with Jews. When Vance was asked if he had any evidence to support the idea that Harris is antisemitic, the Ohio Republican responded by complaining about the question — which he didn’t get around to answering. Nevertheless, around the same time, Trump appeared on Fox and suggested that Shapiro was passed over for the Democratic ticket “because of the fact that he’s Jewish.” All of this is so utterly bonkers, it’s difficult to know where to start, but let’s review a handful of relevant data points. The idea that Democrats are antisemites, denying political opportunities and leadership positions to Jews, is obviously not to be taken seriously. But making matters considerably worse are some of the other relevant details from recent years. Trump, for example, continues to peddle antisemitic tropes as a matter of course. He also hung out with some notorious antisemites at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. All of which is to say, Republicans might see value in picking this fight, but it’s not one they should expect to win."
"On possible vice presidential debate, Vance has a Trumpian answer",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/possible-presidential-debate-vance-trumpian-answer-rcna165759,"When Gov. Tim Walz made his public introduction as his party’s vice presidential candidate this week, the Minnesota Democrat turned his attention to possibly sharing a stage with Sen. JD Vance. “I can’t wait to debate the guy — that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,” Walz said. Putting aside the governor’s crude subtext, the comments helped spark renewed interest in a possible showdown: Donald Trump appears to be afraid of Vice President Kamala Harris, but will Vance agree to debate Walz? The Ohio Republican fielded a question on this on Wednesday, but as a report in The New Republic noted, his answer wasn’t altogether helpful. As part of the same answer, Vance, in apparent seriousness, said Harris doesn’t yet know whether she’ll be her party’s presidential nominee, adding, “[W]e don’t know who the vice presidential nominee is going to be, either.” The Republican concluded that Democrats might yet “pull a bait and switch” and dump Walz from the ticket, which is why, Vance added, he’s “all game” to hold a vice presidential debate with Harris next week. In other words, those hoping to watch a Walz/Vance debate should probably start lowering their expectations. As for the top of the parties’ respective tickets, the GOP presidential nominee shared some new rhetoric on the subject during his latest Fox News interview. The New York Times reported: Trump concluded, “Look, she doesn’t want to debate.” It’s not the first time the former president, who obviously doesn’t want to debate, has engaged in projection, and it probably won’t be the last."
