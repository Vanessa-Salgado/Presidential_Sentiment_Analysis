Shouldn’t Trump release his latest tax returns right about now?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shouldnt-trump-release-latest-tax-returns-right-now-rcna168192,"Donald Trump’s history of unfortunate money-making schemes took an unsettling turn in March when the former president started peddling the “God Bless the U.S.A. Bible,” offering customers an opportunity to get “the only Bible endorsed by President Trump” for just $59.99. It was a predictably successful venture: The cash-strapped Republican made $300,000 on the branded Bibles. We know this because of a personal financial disclosure form Team Trump released nearly two weeks ago. A CNN report on the documents added: All of which left us with a lingering question that regularly goes unasked: Shouldn’t Trump release his latest tax returns right about now? To be sure, I’m mindful of the larger circumstances. In May 2014 — more than a full decade ago — Trump promised to release his tax returns if he became a candidate. “If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely,” the Republican said the year before his ride down the golden escalator. “And I would love to do that.” In the years that followed, Trump ignored the modern bipartisan tradition, kept his tax returns hidden, broke a variety of promises related to transparency, and fought tooth and nail to keep the information from the public. Eventually, in the wake of leaks and court rulings, Americans learned details that were unflattering to the former president. But now that he’s running yet again, and Trump is the GOP’s nominee for the third consecutive cycle, shouldn’t the question return to the fore? Shouldn’t the Republican candidate at least face some questions about whether he’ll release his tax returns — even if we know the answer will be no? Often, questions we know the answers to go unasked, but that doesn’t mean the questions themselves lack merit. To simply not ask Trump about his recent tax returns — putting him to peddle yet another round of dubious claims about IRS audits that are probably imaginary — is to go easy on a major-party nominee for no reason. Indeed, the partisan asymmetry matters. On July 21, President Joe Biden announced that he would end his re-election campaign, and one week later, Vice President Kamala Harris released her tax returns from the previous 20 years. Trump could approach transparency the same way. On several occasions, he has said he would. So where are the documents? Why would he insist on secrecy for his tax returns from the last few years?"

Democrats found a perfect response to Trump's vision of patriotism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-democrats-patriotism-trump-rcna167961,"If you listen to many longtime observers, this year’s Democratic National Convention offered up something different from previous incarnations: an emphasis on striking a patriotic stance. From Vice President Kamala Harris praising “the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American” in her acceptance speech down to the attendees waving little flags in the audience, Democrats put their love of country front and center. But was this that much of a departure from the past? Osita Nwanevu, a contributing editor for The New Republic and columnist with The Guardian, wasn’t so sure Friday. “Which Democratic nominee didn’t ‘embrace patriotism?’” he asked in a now-deleted post on X. “Biden? Obama? Clinton?” Nwanevu is right that there wasn’t a time when Democrats explicitly rejected patriotism. What we saw last week, though, was a shift in tone and rhetoric, as Democrats filled the gap Republicans left wide open to define what “patriotism” means. Rather than mimic the GOP to insist that they are also patriots, for the first time in decades the DNC’s attendees instead declared with their whole chests that theirs is the party of real patriots. For longer than I’ve been alive, Republicans have been more than happy to accuse anyone to the left of former President Ronald Reagan of harboring anti-American sentiments. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, accelerated that trend as, in the aftermath, conservatives called forth a wave of jingoism and xenophobia that they insisted was the only way to love America. The PATRIOT Act authorized vast powers for the federal government to curtail Americans’ privacy and freedom of speech. President George W. Bush’s warning to other nations — “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists” — was turned inward toward any liberals who might speak out against invading Iraq. Many Democrats, terrified of accusations of not respecting the troops or being soft on terror, embarrassed themselves in their attempts to prove their own love of country. It’s impossible to defend how then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., began his acceptance speech at the 2004 DNC without cringing. (“John Kerry, reporting for duty,” he said with a crisp salute, despite having left the military more than 30 years earlier.) In the Obama era, the tea party movement’s thinly veiled racism was initially framed as a rejection of tyranny, drawing on symbols from the American Revolution, and “patriots” became a word associated with a certain brand of conservative. Ever focused on branding, former President Donald Trump claimed that visual vocabulary for his own, entwining his MAGA movement with the trappings of the banal, surface-level patriotism that Republicans had already embraced. But while he has embraced the American flag, sometimes literally, he has denigrated the highest ideals that that flag represents. Instead, Trump has called for the “termination” of the Constitution, and he has already attempted to overturning one presidential election. Trump has called the rioters who attempted to prevent his loss from becoming official on Jan. 6, 2021, “patriots” and just announced a fundraiser in their honor next month. Republicans, with very few exceptions, have backed his dystopian desire to substitute himself in place of devotion to the national interest. Despite that, as The Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted, voters are still more likely to view the GOP as the more patriotic party. Polling has somewhat borne that out in the past. A YouGov poll in 2018 found that Democrats were much less likely to call themselves “very” or even “somewhat” patriotic than their Republican counterparts. It’s worth noting that this was during the height of the Trump years, a time when Democrats had their faith in America deeply shaken. It’s a faith that has yet to recover, though, according to a survey Gallup conducted in June, which found only 34% of Democrats describe themselves as “extremely proud” to be an American. And yet the flag-waving and chants of “U-S-A” last week in Chicago would suggest otherwise. It instead speaks to an effort at redefining what love of country means along with reclaiming the concept of “freedom.” Democrats are celebrating the country’s diversity as a sign of national greatness — as opposed to the GOP’s picture of a nation of homogeneous, unwavering loyalty. This vision expands on President Joe Biden’s framing of the threat to democracy, broadening from a single man to the GOP’s fetish for that man. In setting out this new vision of patriotism, Democrats should remember that there must be room for loving criticism. In her opening essay for “The 1619 Project,” The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote about how Black Americans have always been among the most patriotic citizens. This is because despite the indignities we have suffered, we’ve been the ones most committed to seeing America embrace the better angels of its nature. The same can be said of the protesters gathered outside the arena each day and night to urge the Biden administration to halt the sale of arms to Israel as it continues its war in Gaza. The progressivism Democrats displayed last week can make an awkward fit with the conservative-coded aspects of patriotism, as The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Will Bunch rightly noted. But I would still argue that the two are more in sync than it would first appear. After all, it is an act of love of country to ask it to live up to its own ideals, to believe that it can still change for the better. The wish to see your home hold itself to the morals that it claims to represent is more patriotic than the desire to see one man ensconced as monarch in the White House."
"Democrats, stop calling the Harris-Trump race ‘the prosecutor’ vs. ‘the felon’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-prosecutor-felon-democrats-rcna167349,"Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, some Democrats have summarized her matchup against former President Donald Trump as “the prosecutor” versus “the felon.” On the day that President Joe Biden passed the baton to Harris, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said of her, “She is a prosecutor running against a felon.” At last week’s Democratic convention, speakers including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Biden embraced that framing. In defending his record on public safety, Biden said Monday, “And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.” The prosecutor versus the felon is the kind of glib expression that’s perfect for an election-year bumper sticker. However, the suggestion that a “felon” is inherently and permanently untrustworthy makes for a heaping helping of hypocrisy from a party that has rightly identified overcriminalization, mass incarceration and voter suppression as systemic problems. Yes, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts in May. Were it not for a Georgia prosecutor’s affair with a lawyer she hired, a Trump appointee in Florida entertaining his ridiculous motions and a Supreme Court that seems bent on rejecting the whole theory of America, he may have been convicted of up to 54 more. That said, Trump showed his manifest unfitness for office long before any of those indictments. He exhibited it during his first campaign, during his term in office, while campaigning as an incumbent and no more so than by rejecting his status as a lame duck. And he is further demonstrating that unfitness during this, his third campaign for president. But to label him a felon and use it to mean unfitness is to suggest that all “felons,” by their very nature, are bad and irredeemable. A political slogan can’t communicate every nuance. But at a minimum, it shouldn’t send a message inconsistent with the party’s stated values. There has been a conscious effort in recent years — no doubt derided by detractors as “woke” — to refrain from using language that dehumanizes people and reduces them to their status or their circumstances. Say “enslaved people,” not “slaves.” Say “incarcerated people,” not “prisoners” or “inmates.” Again, there are critics of such constructions, and, without a doubt, those constructions make for clunkier sentences. But the point remains that people who have experienced a thing are far more than the thing they’ve experienced. Consider the lawyer, poet and writer Reginald Dwayne Betts, as brilliant a person as you’ll find in this country. Before he wrote three acclaimed books of poetry and a memoir, and before his genius was recognized by the MacArthur Foundation, he spent years in prison for a violent carjacking he committed when he was 16. When discussing the title of his 2019 volume of poetry, Betts told NPR, “It’s called ‘Felon.’ But the thing is, ‘felon’ is just such an inadequate description of anybody.” Those using the “prosecutor vs. felon” dichotomy appear unaware of the inadequacy of that framing. They may believe themselves to be making a commentary only about Trump. But they are betraying a belief that the word “felon” tells you everything you’ll ever need to know about a person. And, to repeat, they’re undercutting their arguments against less punitive sentences and their arguments against letting people who’ve served their time vote again. If all felons are bad, then why should we fight for their right to participate in elections? Let’s set aside the fact that some people convicted of felonies aren’t guilty and, for argument’s sake, assume that everyone so labeled committed a significant crime. Even then, the list of felons would include good people who did uncharacteristically awful things, sometimes accidental things. That list would also include people who were horrible human beings and turned their lives around. And, yes, it would include people like Trump, that is, people we know would commit the same crimes again if given the chance. The argument against Trump, therefore, isn’t that he has a record. It’s that he’s unrepentant: a mendacious, self-seeking narcissist who has never evinced a shred of self-reflection or regret. It’s that he never has been, and likely never will be, deserving of anybody’s trust, let alone the country’s trust. As a veteran journalist, I have known a significant number of elected officials who have gone to prison. Not only that, but I’ve watched a few of them re-emerge, return to the game of politics and even run for office again. One of them once requested a meeting with me where he asked how I squared my belief in second chances with my opposition to his candidacy. Easily. My belief that people shouldn’t be forever punished doesn’t mean I think people who have been criminally punished and then run for office are automatically due political support. It doesn’t mean I think they’re good people. There are people I’d consider voting for even if they have gone to prison, and others I’d never consider even if they haven’t. Under no circumstances would the Democrats throwing around the word “felon” have considered voting for him even if a jury hadn’t found him guilty. That’s because they’re not opposed to Trump because he’s a “felon.” They’re opposed to Trump because he’s Trump."
States want to reduce qualifications for teachers. That’s a huge mistake.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 7:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/states-teachers-reduce-qualifications-school-year-rcna167554,"As the new school year begins across the country, public schools are struggling to hire and retain qualified teachers. Fewer young adults are entering the profession, shortages remain high — especially in hard-to-staff subjects and regions — and school staffs lack the diversity of their student populations. In attempting to fill vacancies, lawmakers in Florida, New Hampshire and elsewhere have proposed cutting corners by reducing the qualifications necessary to become a licensed teacher. But as an education policy analyst and a former teacher, I know this is a mistake. Deprofessionalizing education only compounds the harm that staffing shortages inflict on students and communities. Moving forward means addressing the root cause: lack of respect for teachers. Teaching public school during the first years of the Covid-19 pandemic, I experienced firsthand the treatment teachers face — and it was a roller coaster of a ride. One moment we were revered as hardworking heroes who care for children’s well-being and education. The next, we were called selfish and lazy by policymakers and the press alike. The infamous phrase “those who can’t do, teach” was weaponized against us. We were called insignificant at best, and manipulative at worst. Teachers have never asked to be called heroes; we just want to be respected as experts in our field. Public perception of teachers in America plays out in the ways they’re treated, starting with salary. As any educator will tell you, they aren’t in it for the money. But it is simply insulting that teachers make an average of 26.4% less than professions with similar levels of education in America. This disparity has been growing since the 1990s, with no sign of a rebound on the horizon. For people committed to educating our nation’s future generations, this pay gap can feel like a slap in the face, neglecting both the importance of their role and the amount of work teachers devote to their craft. Being an educator requires a level of expertise developed and maintained through high-quality preparation programs, continued professional development and experience. It demands a comprehensive understanding of child development, classroom behavior management and curriculum design and presentation. It means finding ways to connect lessons to differing learning styles, individual cultures and the community at large. And it entails building interpersonal relationships with students and helping empower them and their families to thrive outside the classroom. All of this is to say, teachers are vital members of the villages that raise our children. They play a pivotal role in developing America’s future doctors, engineers, artists, politicians, educators and engaged community members. Some of the recent policies proposed to address teacher workforce shortages suggest that any adult is capable of stepping into a classroom, managing student behavior and effectively implementing high-quality lessons. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. Countless studies demonstrate that among all school-related factors, teacher quality has the highest impact on student achievement. It affects not only students’ academic performance, but also everything from attendance and disciplinary records to socioemotional skills like collaboration and self-regulation. When children have an underqualified or uncertified teacher, when they’re jammed into already-packed classrooms, when their teacher receives little to no support from their district, their performance and development suffer as a result. And poor-quality education affects our nation as a whole — it weakens our economy, our national security and even our democracy. We can’t fix the teacher shortage by insulting everyone who is a part of the profession. We have to reframe what it means to be an educator and to be respected as such. Policies that don’t stem from this core tenet simply won’t produce results that benefit our students or the future of our country. Instead, policymakers should close the teacher pay gap; invest in public education to equip teachers with the resources and programming to ensure their students thrive; implement high-quality teacher apprenticeship models; and support student and teacher mental health. While some may look to seemingly quick solutions, long-term investments are the real solutions that strengthen our education system. To effectively address the challenges our teacher workforce faces, policymakers have to acknowledge that investing in the field of education is a worthy cause. Ensuring a bright and successful American future means properly educating the next generation. And to do that, we have to invest in those doing the educating — making sure they have sufficient financial and professional support; reducing barriers to entering and remaining in the field; and investing in school resources. As for the rest of us? We can help shift the narrative in our own communities and respect teachers as the experts they are."
How I’ve been convincing Christians they don’t have to vote Republican,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/christians-kamala-can-pull-evangelical-voters-away-donald-trump-rcna167561,"During the last month, Christians for Kamala joined the ranks of groups supporting Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. In so doing, they stand beside groups as wide-ranging as Comics for Kamala and Deadheads for Kamala. Because Harris has shown she will include us all in her vision for the United States and bring together what has been torn apart, all of these groups have seized upon the newfound enthusiasm among the electorate since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July and endorsed Harris. A religious coalition such as this entering the chat is an important step in the right direction, and, if built upon, could help sway enough movable religious voters in critical battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. What’s more, it could mean breaking the stronghold that MAGA forces have on many of our country’s evangelical voters. Thanks in part to the cooperation of so many self-identified Christian voters, the MAGA movement has seized control of the Republican Party and helped lead our country down a dark, democracy-threatening path. Former President Donald Trump and his team know this, and it’s at the core of their strategy in the lead-up to the November election. Compared with 2016, an erosion of his support from white men was Trump’s biggest problem in 2020, and his campaign is working overtime to fix that in 2024. In many places, this means courting white Christian men, especially from the evangelical and Catholic traditions. That’s one of the reasons he picked Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who converted to Catholicism five years ago, as his running mate. Central to our work at Vote Common Good, I spend a lot of my time traveling the country speaking to voters, particularly evangelical and Catholic voters who are hardwired into voting Republican, working to get them to break out of those patterns. What I’ve learned is that most don’t want or need their elected leader to be like them, but they really do want their leader to like them. It wasn’t clear that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton liked evangelical and Catholic men when she ran for president in 2016, and it remains largely unclear to many of these voters in 2024 if Kamala Harris does. Trump, on the other hand, probably doesn’t like them, but he put his arms around these voters in a transactional exchange, and he promised and in some cases delivered them power. But on the trail in 2020, 2022 and this year, I’ve gleaned the reason many evangelical and Christian voters ultimately leave Trump: his obvious lack of kindness. A poll that my organization Vote Common Good commissioned in 2020 showed that in swing states, Trump’s lack of kindness was driving evangelical and Catholic voters away in large enough numbers to potentially affect the outcome of the election. Voters typically realize that the way they vote reflects on them. And those religious voters who defected from Trump didn’t like the way his unkindness reflected on them, whether it be putting migrant children in cages, the way he treats women, the way he treats the press, the way he treats nearly everyone who left his administration and the way he treats democracy itself. Many of these voters know that’s not the behavior they want their children to emulate. The Harris campaign clearly knows it has an opportunity here. The choice of Tim Walz as vice presidential nominee is in no small part evidence of that. But it isn’t nearly enough. Democrats more broadly need to embrace the idea that evangelicals, and especially white male evangelicals, are worth winning and can be won without the party compromising its values. What it’s going to take is a concerted, grassroots effort to reach these voters, listen to them and bring them along on a journey to help them understand it’s OK for them to let concern for the common good, and not allegiance to a political party, determine how they vote. We need to tell them that what Democrats are pushing for lines up with the values evangelicals hold dear — making the world better and bringing people together. Those policies include commonsense gun reform to keep kids safe, engaging solutions at the border and lowering the cost of child care. Many Christians are heartbroken at the idea that they have to choose between a faith that’s meaningful to them and a political identity that has been wedded to it. They don’t know what to do, and we need to help them separate those two identities. It will take an effort like the one we made in Kent County, Mich., home to Grand Rapids and several Christian universities, before the 2020 election. We held voter rallies and roundtables; put up billboards juxtaposing the words of Jesus Christ with those of Trump; sent thousands of postcards to evangelical voters; and trained multiple local Democratic candidates on how to engage with faith voters. Our message to the 25% of the Kent County electorate that identified as evangelical was simple: Trump lacks kindness and it’s OK not to vote for the Republican. Trump beat Clinton by 3 points in Kent County in 2016. In 2020, he lost to Biden there by 6 points, a 9-point swing. I always believed a shift like that was possible, and I was at the convention in Chicago telling everyone who would listen the Kent County story and making the case that we cannot ignore evangelical voters. My efforts included being on a panel focused on how to move gettable voters. Biden did better than Hillary Clinton did with evangelical voters, and if we come together and don’t leave these folks to Trump, I think it’s possible for Harris to receive the highest level of evangelical support since Jimmy Carter got roughly half the evangelical vote in 1976. And if that were to happen, it would break the back of the MAGA movement. Now that the convention is over, we’ll be fueling up our bus, hitting the road and driving to Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and back to some of those same places again. We won’t leave movable voters out there on their own. We’ll let them know that they can make that switch, and they won’t be shunned or punished for it. We won’t give up on them, because they can help save our country from the antidemocratic policies the MAGA movement has been unleashing. Christians for Kamala, which I’m a part of, will make sure Christian faith voters are engaged in the political process."
I’m a judge. Here’s why the viral video of a teenager’s humiliation has me furious.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/detroit-judge-sued-handcuffed-teen-rcna167650,"I’ve been told that ego stands for “easing God out.” The video of a Detroit judge’s dehumanizing treatment of a teenage girl who dozed off in his courtroom while on a field trip to the courthouse is confirmation of this truth. Judge Kenneth King, the presiding criminal division judge in Michigan’s 36th District Court, yelled at a 15-year-old student who was visiting his courtroom with a nonprofit group and then sent her to the court’s jail cell, where she was made to disrobe and change into a jail jumpsuit and sit alone. As if that were not already excessively punitive, King continued the teenager’s humiliation by ordering her back into the courtroom as she wore handcuffs. He made her plead for leniency. He had her peers, some of whom were unable to muffle their laughter, vote on her fate. King, who has since been removed from his docket and ordered to undergo mandatory training, defended his actions when it became known what he’d done to the girl. “That’s not something that normally happens,” he told Detroit’s WXYZ-TV. “But I felt compelled to do it because I didn’t like the child’s attitude.” Calling his actions “my own version of ‘Scared Straight,’” he told the TV station, “I haven’t been disrespected like that in a very long time.” But the most glaring disrespect exhibited that day was from the judge himself. He not only disrespected the teenager he had before him, but he also disrespected the judiciary. In fact, watching what that judge did to that young person — which would have been out of order even if she were a defendant, not merely a student on a summer field trip — made me furious as a member of the legal profession, a retired jurist, a mother and a human being. Last week, the teenager’s family sued King, accusing him of violating her civil rights. “This is a very troubling case,” one of the family’s lawyers said. “We had a member of our bench denigrate, humiliate, intimidate and essentially incarcerate a 15-year-old kid.” That attorney is right. It is troubling. Visiting a courtroom should have been an opportunity to spark a desire in this young Black woman to, say, become a Supreme Court justice like Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Instead, because of King, she had a devastating encounter with a judge wrongly flaunting his authority that will only deepen her distrust, and the public’s distrust, in our justice system. True authority does not try hard. People who understand their authority know they don’t have to speak harshly to command respect. Authority is communicated through professionalism and fairness. Unfortunately, the judge in this case was more interested in asserting his dominance over this young person than in fostering an environment of learning, understanding and respect in his courtroom. There was no way the judge was going to look good by turning her into an inmate because she had fallen asleep. But he looked even worse after details of her circumstances were revealed. Latoreya Till, the teen’s mother, told NBC News that they have no permanent housing and that they had arrived late at the home where they were staying the night before the teenager’s field trip. In an interview with WXYZ-TV, she said, “The fact that he was talking about ‘You go home and get in your bed,’ how do you know my baby got a home? How do you know my baby got a bed, her own bed she could sleep in? She don’t have that right now, so she was tired.” People often fall asleep in court because of medication, a medical condition, the temperature in the courtroom, or not understanding the court proceedings. His ego made him assume she fell asleep to disrespect him. I know that being a judge is hard. I served for nearly 10 years in the municipal court in Newark, New Jersey. When I took my oath, I committed myself to treating every person who entered my courtroom with dignity, respect and fairness. This commitment is fundamental to the justice system’s purpose, to ensuring justice for all. This belief is grounded in a concept known as procedural justice or procedural fairness. Put simply, when people believe they are treated with dignity, respect and fairness by the justice system, the outcomes are overwhelmingly positive. Compliance with court orders increases. The public trusts the justice system more. And crime goes down. The principles of procedural justice require judges, attorneys and other justice system actors to ensure that people are given a voice, understand the process, and are treated with neutrality and respect. Crucially, and somewhat counterintuitively, this is as important as whether someone wins or loses in court. In other words, when a person feels like they have been treated decently, they are usually willing to accept the outcome of the case, even if it goes against them. What King did goes against every principle of procedural justice. Thankfully, few judges engage in such behavior. Still, this should serve as a stark reminder for those with authority of the dangers of ego. King had an obligation to remember that he wore a robe and not a crown. The judge’s behavior didn’t just harm one student; it harmed every person in the courtroom that day by negatively shaping their perception (or confirming their existing negative beliefs) about the justice system. Courtroom observers should leave with a greater respect for the judicial process. Clearly, those in King’s courtroom that day did not. A judge’s authority is not a weapon to be hurled at the weak. A judge’s authority must be used to protect, uplift and embody the principles of procedural justice. As the teenager’s mother put it, he was “supposed to show love and sympathy and implement the law, and he didn’t do none of that.”"
Trump judge greenlights machine guns under Second Amendment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/machine-guns-second-amendment-bruen-rcna168012,"A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump dismissed criminal charges for machine gun possession this week, citing the Second Amendment and Supreme Court precedent. The ruling highlights how the high court has expanded gun rights, as well as the broader impact Trump has had on the judiciary beyond the Supreme Court. U.S. District Judge John Broomes’ ruling on Wednesday stemmed from the prosecution of Tamori Morgan, who was charged with two counts of possessing a machine gun under federal law. Morgan cited the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in Bruen to argue that the case should be dismissed on Second Amendment grounds. Justice Clarence Thomas’ opinion for the Republican-appointed majority in Bruen said that gun regulations can’t stand unless they’re “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” The Kansas federal judge wrote that in Morgan’s case, the government failed to meet its burden “to demonstrate through historical analogs that regulation of the weapons at issue in this case are consistent with the nation’s history of firearms regulation.” The vast implications of Broomes’ ruling might not be fully realized if the government gets it reversed on appeal. The judge noted that the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Kansas and neighboring states, had yet to apply Bruen to the law at issue in Morgan’s case. There’s reason to think that even this Supreme Court could side with the government if the issue reaches the justices. Just this past term, in United States v. Rahimi, the court ruled 8-1 (over Thomas’ dissent) to uphold gun restrictions on people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence. The Rahimi case suggests that the court isn’t prepared to take the Bruen precedent as far as it could go. But in the meantime, chaos looms for gun laws and public safety — whether it’s due to the Supreme Court’s expansive gun jurisprudence, the misinterpretation of that jurisprudence by lower court judges, or both.

Why I’m (still) rooting for Jennifer Lopez to find true love,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-marriage-divorce-love-rcna168038,"When Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck tied the knot two years ago, nearly 20 years after they first became engaged, I was rooting for them. I’m a sucker for a good love story, and theirs read like a plot from one of the breezy paperbacks I pick up when I need an escape from reality. I understood that there was a strong possibility the union would last only slightly longer than it takes to read a romance novel. At 53, J.Lo didn’t have the greatest track record. Affleck is her fourth husband, the result of her sixth proposal. (Her collection of engagement rings is allegedly worth millions.) Also, Hollywood marriages tend to have the lifespan of a Drosophila. Still, when news broke earlier this week that Lopez had filed for divorce, I felt like Charlie Brown after Lucy yanks the football away. It wasn’t so much that the inevitable had happened, but that Lopez has once again failed in holding on to something she very publicly seems to covet: true, lasting love. I’m not in the habit of feeling sorry for celebrities, especially ones with great hair and perfectly toned bodies and the kind of disposable incomes that enable them to drop $20 million to make a behind-the-scenes documentary about their latest album and feature film. Also, I’m guessing that the last thing Jennifer Lopez wants right now is pity. But I can’t help it. I feel bad for her. I saw that documentary, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told.” It came out a few weeks after Valentine’s Day this year and I found it much more watchable than the weird feature film, “This is Me…Now: A Love Story,” that inspired it. I like human interest stories, and while I’m fully aware that Lopez is an excellent actor and maybe she was acting in the documentary, the romantic in me nonetheless bought what she was selling: true love, self-love, redemptive love… all the love. Not that there weren’t warning signs. Call me a cynic, but I’m certainly not the only one who is skeptical of over-the-top displays and proclamations of devotion. My first instinct is usually to wonder if there’s some overcompensation involved. If your love is that solid, do you need to tell everyone? Shouldn’t it be obvious? Even with J.Lo’s penchant for living private moments in public, the performative aspects of “Bennifer” gave me pause. Also, it was impossible to ignore that Affleck didn’t seem entirely on board with turning their love story into content. He reminded me of Warren Beatty in the 1991 documentary “Truth or Dare,” in which the iconic actor observed, frustratedly and disdainfully, that Madonna, his then-lover, “doesn’t want to live off-camera, much less talk.” Thirty-three years later, the publicity-shy Beatty is happily (we hope) married to the equally publicity-shy Annette Bening. Meanwhile, Madonna spent her 66th birthday posting long Instagram albums with her 28-year-old boyfriend at the same Italian resort where Lopez apparently holed up earlier this the summer. Could that be a harbinger of things to come? Eleven years from now, will a 66-year-old Lopez be back in Italy with her own 28-year-old boyfriend? Maybe. But that’s not the impression she’s given in interviews promoting the aforementioned documentary. Sure, she’s a glamorous Hollywood creature who exists on a rarefied plane high above the rest of us mere mortals, but at her core I believe that there’s a still part of her — the “Jenny from the Block” part, perhaps — who wants her happy ending. I can’t imagine she’s going to quit looking for it, but something has to change or we’re going to keep repeating the she’s-in-love-she’s-getting-married-it’s-over pattern ad infinitum. History has shown that’s not good for anybody. Plenty of people have been comparing Lopez and Affleck to Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, which is natural and tempting, but also feels like an easy out — and a curse. Anonymous, pro-Affleck sources in Page Six, for what they’re worth (not much), have been quoted summing up Affleck and Lopez’s life together as a “fever dream.” That doesn’t bode well for a reconciliation. As someone who bought my first copy of People magazine as a middle schooler 50 years ago, my fascination with the lifestyles of the rich and famous runs deep. I’d like to think I’m above falling into the pit of parasocial celebrity relationships — the potentially toxic cultural phenomenon wherein fans feel entitled to judge their stars. I’m not interested in judging — indeed what’s drawn me to the latest chapter of J.Lo’s search-for-love story is its humanity. Even someone who works so hard, is incredibly successful at what she does and looks great doing it is as human as the rest of us. It’s a lesson in reality: Nobody gets through this life without failures and frustrations. Ideally, we learn from our mistakes so we avoid repeating them — and if anybody has the resources to obtain an education, it’s J.Lo. I wish her well. I hope she finds that true love sooner rather than later. But in the meantime, I’ll be finding my happy endings at my local indie book store."
The DNC outperformed the RNC in a category that will probably vex Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 1:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/dnc-ratings-rnc-trump-tv-crowds-rcna168089,"As Democrats made the case for their presidential nominee this week, an average of 21.8 million viewers tuned in over four days to watch the events in Chicago, according to Nielsen data. Viewership numbers for the Democratic National Convention eclipsed the Republican National Convention’s 19.1 million average viewers in July. And, per Nielsen, the final night of the DNC, which featured Harris’ acceptance speech, drew 26.2 million viewers, slightly higher than the 25.3 million people who watched the last night of the Republican convention. Part of that may be due to the length of the nominees’ speeches: Harris’ clocked in at a relatively brief 38 minutes, while Trump’s went on for 92 minutes — the longest nomination acceptance speech on record. Curiosity and anticipation for Harris, whose candidacy has garnered a ton of enthusiasm among Democrats, may also explain the interest in the DNC. But other factors might have boosted viewership: The party rolled out A-list celebrity speakers like Oprah Winfrey and musical acts like Lil Jon and Pink, and there was intense speculation (that eventually proved unfounded) that Beyoncé would make an appearance on the final night of the convention to endorse Harris. Convention ratings are far from an accurate indicator of who will win an election. But those data points might vex the GOP nominee, who has long taken pride in his ability to draw a crowd. Trump’s fixation on TV ratings and crowd size are well documented, and his frustration with the large audiences that Harris has drawn at her campaign events in recent weeks has been obvious. He has falsely claimed that Harris used artificial intelligence to change a photo to inflate the number of attendees at her rally in Detroit — a claim he appeared to walk back days later. When asked how concerned he was about the audience at Harris’ rallies, Trump accused the media of being “dishonest” about his crowd sizes. He also suggested that more people turned out for his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 — which preceded the Capitol riots — than for Martin Luther King Jr.’s address during the March on Washington in 1963."
"Judge faults Breonna Taylor's boyfriend for her death, drops key charges against two cops",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 12:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/breonna-taylor-charges-dismissed-officers-rcna168070,"A Kentucky judge ruled that Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend's decision to open fire is the legal cause of her fatal shooting by police officers, throwing out federal charges against two officers who allegedly falsified a drug warrant that led to police breaking down her door and killing her in 2020. In a decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Simpson III dismissed felony deprivation of rights charges against former Louisville Police Detective Joshua Jaynes, who was accused of knowingly drafting a false search warrant affidavit on Taylor’s home, and former Sgt. Kyle Meany, who approved the warrant. Three plainclothes Louisville police officers, Brett Hankison, Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, executed the search warrant on Taylor’s home on March 13, 2020. Startled awake by pounding on the door, Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he assumed it was a break-in and fired a shot in the dark, which struck Mattingly. The officers fired 32 shots in return, killing Taylor. The judge ruled that “there is no direct link between the warrantless entry and Taylor’s death,” writing that Jaynes and Meany were not involved in the raid on Taylor’s home. Instead, he wrote, it was Walker’s decision to open fire that was the legal cause of Taylor’s death. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced federal charges against Jaynes, Meany and two other officers in 2022. Simpson’s ruling on Thursday means that Jaynes and Meany, who could have faced life in prison had they been found guilty on the felony charges, now face only misdemeanor charges related to covering up the allegedly false search warrant and lying to investigators. Both men have pleaded not guilty to all charges. There has not yet been an objective accounting of the chaos during Taylor’s fatal shooting. Her family has long disputed police accounts of what happened at her home that night, and the officers who executed the warrant have given differing versions of the events. None of the officers used body cameras during the operation. Taylor’s family said in a statement to The Associated Press that prosecutors told them they plan to appeal Simpson’s ruling. “Obviously we are devastated at the moment by the judge’s ruling with which we disagree and are just trying to process everything,” they said. “The only thing we can do at this point is continue to be patient. ... We will continue to fight until we get full justice for Breonna Taylor.”"
The DNC showed how the Democrats are willing to accept the unacceptable on Gaza,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 10:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-gaza-israel-kamala-harris-rcna167973,"Before the Democratic National Convention kicked off, a big question on my mind was, “How is the party going to address the crisis in the Gaza Strip?” We now have an answer: by sweeping it under the rug. Over the course of four days of lively speeches — infused with an extra excitement around Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the unexpected party nominee — the Biden administration’s backing of Israel’s barbarous military operation in the Gaza Strip rarely came up. It reflects a gamble by the Democratic Party that it can win the election by snubbing the movement objecting to it, by pretending that the U.S. is not supplying munitions used in atrocities. Despite a constant refrain about standing up for the little guy, calls for the protection of Palestinian civilians were all but absent. Despite all the rhetoric about a big tent, speakers and programming ignored the thousands of protesters outside the convention calling for a change in U.S. foreign policy toward Gaza. Despite all the calls for inclusivity and the showcasing of several Republican speakers, Democratic officials rejected a request from the “Uncommitted” movement to allow a Palestinian American to speak from the main stage. Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian American and one of the Democrats backed by the Uncommitted movement as a potential speaker, shared the speech she wanted to deliver with Mother Jones. That speech, which the Uncommitted movement said it was open to having vetted and edited, was a far cry from a radical text. In keeping with the overall party position, it called for a cease-fire and for Democrats to mobilize for Harris — and singled out Trump as bad for Palestinians. But it would have drawn more attention to the Palestinian civilians who are being killed en masse in Gaza, and it hinted at the possibility of policy change. The DNC gave a substantial speaking slot to the parents of an Israeli American man who was tragically abducted on Oct. 7 during Hamas’ vicious attacks on Israel. The speakers framed their plea for a cease-fire and the release of Hamas’ hostages as an apolitical, humanitarian demand. If the DNC had wanted to give an equivalent speaker a platform to discuss the experience of Americans with Palestinian relatives suffering or killed in Gaza, that would’ve been easy. But in reality none of these speeches are truly apolitical — as evidenced by the DNC’s decision to allow a family tied to only one side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to speak. From that choice, it’s hard to conclude anything other than that in the Democratic establishment’s eyes, Israeli lives matter more than Palestinian lives. However, I believe that even a purely “apolitical” speech by a Palestinian American calling attention to the horrors that abound in Gaza would have had its own issues. What’s happening in region is in fact not some kind of natural disaster: Human rights observers and scholars of genocide — a number of them Israeli — have characterized Israel’s ongoing conduct in Gaza as perpetrating genocide. What’s needed is not thoughts and prayers and vague acknowledgements of suffering. What’s needed are policy changes, with the U.S. ending its exceptional and effectively unconditional financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel. The handful of times that DNC speakers mentioned the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation in Gaza was mentioned only briefly, if at all. President Joe Biden and Harris both called for a cease-fire and acknowledged that people in Gaza are suffering. (Some pundits thought Harris used new language suggesting she may stand to the left of Biden on the issue. Those pundits are wrong.) But the Biden administration’s ongoing reliance on “we’re working on a cease-fire” rhetoric appears to be sly positioning. It allows Biden and Harris to sound sympathetic to the pro-Palestinian left. But, crucially, the language makes no commitment to change or condition a single element of the U.S. relationship toward Israel. For example, the United States’ best leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who has dragged his feet in the negotiation process — on a cease-fire that actually respects Palestinian autonomy is to credibly threaten to cut off the unending supply of military and financial resources. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s speech offered perhaps the most striking indication of the party’s position on Gaza. As I wrote earlier this week, the congresswoman from New York called for a cease-fire but omitted any mention of the people in Gaza or a need for policy change. As one of the most influential progressives in Congress, her speech suggested that even the left wing of the party has abdicated its commitment to fighting injustice abroad for the sake of message discipline. On an electoral level, addressing Gaza is difficult for the Democratic Party. It’s a genuine wedge issue, with younger and more progressive Democrats critical of Democratic policy and older, more conservative Democrats unmoved by or supportive of what’s happening. A move in any direction invariably infuriates different constituencies within the party. But ultimately the Democrats may be banking on the theory that deflecting from the issue is the least costly approach since it isn’t a top-tier issue for most young voters. Moreover, Harris’ surprise nomination may very well have slowed down the momentum the pro-Palestinian movement had built around pressuring Biden. Protests at the DNC, while sizable, were smaller than expected. And it is conceivable that disenchanted Arab American voters in Michigan could be less averse to Harris, who has used ambiguous, noncommittal language to her advantage. But Democrats’ position, as manifested in their convention, is still a costly one. By shunning promises of change, they increase the odds that the policy status quo will prevail, since politicians tend to try to fulfill pledges and view breaking them as damaging. It is a moral stain on the party, and it helps to further normalize a racialized tolerance for killing innocents (something that America tried to reckon with in 2020 but failed to deliver on). How can Democrats consider themselves progressive while backing a regime with such blatant disregard for human life? It is also perilous for U.S. strategic interests for it to blindly support Israel’s military operations. The military operation in Gaza is increasing the likelihood of regional war in a region of acute geopolitical importance. And the U.S. erodes its soft power and ability to build alliances against adversaries like Russia when the world can see the U.S. has no consistent values when it comes to standing against domination. The party’s choices this week indicate that it is willing to continue to accept what should be unacceptable. It is betting the way to keep its coalition together is to avoid the issue, to keep the status quo intact and, when discussing the issue, to sometimes engage in a brief pantomime of concern for civilian life. Gaza is going the way of the liberal land acknowledgement — ritualistic virtue-signaling atop a kind of resignation toward the annihilation of a civilization."
'A betrayal': RFK Jr.'s family members decry his endorsement of Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 8:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-endorsement-family-rcna168068,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s family members have denounced his decision to endorse Donald Trump after he dropped out of the presidential race, calling it a “betrayal” of their family’s values. In a statement released shortly after Kennedy announced Friday that he is suspending his independent bid for president and backing the Republican nominee, five of his siblings reiterated their support for the Democratic ticket and criticized their brother. “Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,” they wrote. “It is a sad ending to a sad story.” The statement was signed by five of his eight surviving siblings: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Chris Kennedy and Rory Kennedy. Kennedy’s family members have been open about their disdain for his long-shot presidential bid. Several of them publicly backed President Joe Biden in April, and they have continued to support the Harris-Walz ticket since Biden stepped aside. A member of the famed Democratic political dynasty endorsing Trump would have been unthinkable even 18 months ago. But the 70-year-old anti-vaccine activist’s distrust in government has appeal on the right, and his penchant for conspiracy theories aligns with Trump’s own leanings. In his speech in Arizona on Friday, Kennedy railed against what he called Democrats’ “continual legal warfare” against him and Trump, and he accused the media of engaging in a conspiracy with Democrats to hinder his campaign. Kennedy also acknowledged that his involvement with Trump’s campaign “will be a difficult sacrifice for my wife and children” but is “worthwhile” to save children from processed foods and obesity. At a campaign rally later on Friday, Trump praised Kennedy — an opponent he once called “the most radical left candidate in the race” — as a “great person.” Kennedy’s endorsement may ultimately carry little weight, however. He had been performing poorly in polls and his campaign’s fundraising had been in dire straits in recent months. But the Trump campaign may be banking on Kennedy bringing enough supporters to tip the scales in what is set to be a tight election, especially in critical swing states."
These fact-checks about Trump are accurate — but they completely miss the point,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-fact-check-dnc-video-rcna167571,"It’s been a rough week for fact-checkers, as many of their most loyal readers lost patience with their approach to the job. The low point came Monday. A video at the Democratic National Convention showed a clip of Donald Trump saying in 2016 that “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions. Someone at PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit, then posted on X a link to an old fact check on the issue rating criticism of this quote “mostly false.” “He walked back the comment the same day,” the post noted. “We found no evidence that he currently supports legal penalties for women who have abortions.” A community note soon appeared beneath the post. “It is incorrect to say that showing an unedited video of Trump’s own words is ‘false,’” it said. “Reporting from 2016 confirms that this is something Trump said. Even if he walked it back following criticism, it is not false to accurately quote something Trump said.” Take it from me, a former fact-checker: There is nothing lower than this. Having your own facts checked by users of X — not Twitter, but Elon Musk’s vastly degraded version of it — is like watching an NBA player get dunked on by a 14-year-old kid. A reporter for The Washington Post also took heat for a quick fact check of President Joe Biden’s convention speech, in which Biden said that Trump would refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. “But that’s not true,” the reporter wrote. “Trump just hasn’t said that he would accept. And he has previously said the only way he loses is if the Democrats cheat.” This is looking-glass logic. Trump is literally refusing to accept a loss already when he says he can’t lose. These weren’t isolated incidents either. Fact-checkers have also raised hackles recently when they said: These fact checks were all very thoroughly reported, with relevant details and useful context. But they all faced the same problem: They completely missed the point. Some of this is due to a basic courtesy that fact-checkers pretty much have to extend to people running for office. If a candidate promises to do something — or not do something — fact-checkers take them at their word. PolitiFact even maintains a “Promise Tracker” to check whether each presidential campaign pledge is kept or broken. There’s good reason for that. Research has shown that candidates try to keep their promises, contrary to what the cynics think. And to be fair, in most cases there’s no real way to fact-check what may happen in the future other than what a campaign says. But Trump is not like other politicians. PolitiFact’s own Promise Tracker found that he broke 53% of his promises in his term, compared to 23% for Barack Obama and just 3% for Biden. When a fact-checker smacks down a Democrat by noting that Trump has promised not to do something, it ignores that Trump has more often than not broken his promises. Normal candidates also try not to lie. Again, I know that’s not what cynics believe, but politicians who get fact-checked on a certain line will typically drop it or revise it to be more accurate in response. (I once had a rather tense lunch with a campaign staffer who wanted me to retract a fact-check so they could keep using the line.) But Trump’s own former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said at the Democratic convention that he has “no fidelity to the truth” and told her to simply repeat things until people believed them. There’s no simple solution here. Some of these pieces would have been just fine if they weren’t billed as “fact checks.” My advice would be to go ahead and share the context of what Trump said about injecting bleach, but don’t split hairs over what he meant with his bizarre ramblings. And if fact-checkers do have to make a judgment call, I’d advise that they not get tangled up in semantic games and focus on the big picture. If there’s any consolation for the fact-checkers from this last week, it’s that people are upset. That’s a sign that voters still care about the facts — even when politicians don’t."
How Tim Walz’s dumb taco joke broke MAGA brains,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-white-guy-tacos-harris-campaign-video-trump-ann-coulter-rcna167678,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz broke MAGA brains for the second time in a month — and he wasn’t even calling them “weird” this time. He was making fun of himself. Prior to winning the Democratic veepstakes, Walz mocked the hypocrisy of the GOP’s “freedom” branding despite its support for abortion bans, educational censorship and hostility to LGBTQ people. When he called them “weird” for that, pundits from both the party of Trump and the MAGA-adjacent faux-center gasped in horror and suggested that in slamming Donald Trump and JD Vance, he’d attacked half the country. More recently, they lost their minds about Walz making a completely forgettable quip — calling it a joke gives it way too much credit — about how he eats “white guy tacos.” What’s a white guy taco to Walz? “Pretty much ground beef and cheese.” Then he mumbled another throwaway line about black pepper being as hot a spice as his region prefers. These quotes are from a campaign video where Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris do their best attempt at a buddy banter clip — the kind of humanizing campaign advertising that’s so normal it’s hardly ever noticed. Since at least the dawn of television, presidential and vice presidential candidates have tried to sell themselves as just regular people, not highly ambitious politicians working together to secure the most powerful position in the world. That’s all this video was. An advertisement. But to some of the toughest-talking, eff-your-feelings MAGA pundits, it was a hate crime. It was proof that Walz is a fraud and possibly a traitor to his race. Ben Shapiro, generally regarded as a high-level conservative public intellectual, didn’t find Walz’s dumb Midwestern dad joke funny. The author of tweets accusing Colin Powell of being an “affirmative action general” responded with: “See, folks, it’s funny that white people hate spices! Not racist at all! Just funny!” Then he added a fact check about Europeans fighting wars over the spice trade. Shapiro later devoted an entire segment on his show to making these same points. Then came the sleuths who insisted Walz was also a liar. A famous Pizzagate propagator uncovered the awful truth: Walz won a recipe contest! And it was taco-related! To prove he had the goods, the Pizzagate guy shared a screenshot of the ingredients Walz used: paprika, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, olive oil. And mild green chiles and a bottle of medium taco sauce. The dish was called “Tim’s Turkey Taco Tot Hotdish.” It’s based on ground turkey, cheese, sour cream and sweet corn. It’s served with tater tots. It is literally a Midwestern meat and potatoes casserole with a Taco Bell kids menu level of spice. Though that recipe is hardly proof that Walz is a secret spice guy, one right-wing influencer with a huge audience claimed, “He has to appeal to the white guilt crowd now so he is changing his position on spices.” Even Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., got in on the Walz Tacogate pile-on, slamming Walz for denying his true seasoning legacy. Foreign policy writer Nicholas Grossman summarized this curious phenomenon well: “Right-wing podcasters: Oh so when I make mean-spirited disparaging comments about other races it’s wrong, but when Tim Walz makes a mild dad joke at his own race’s expense it’s ok? How is that fair? I’m the victim here. Yes, again.” A political science professor described their expressed outrage as “ambient victimhood.” In the current state of the culture wars, the MAGA right and its enablers have hair-trigger offense reactions. And some of them are openly debasing themselves as their fragility leads them to viciously lash out at their liberal tormentors. An “anti-woke” account with nearly 3 million followers posted a short video showing Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, with her arm draped casually around her dad during the Democratic National Convention. The caption read: “This is Kamala’s family. Beyond parody.” I honestly can’t fathom what they’re mad about. Ella’s tattoos? Her short hair? That she and her father appear genuinely relaxed around each other? Ann Coulter — inarguably one of the meanest people in the political discourse for decades — was triggered by a photo of Walz’s son, Gus, shedding tears of joy as his father accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president. She wrote, “Talk about weird…” Again, what is she offended by? Is the image of a young male publicly expressing deep emotion part of a feminist conspiracy to lower the population or something? I mean, even Shapiro conceded the moment was “really quite nice.” Coulter went too far even by MAGA standards of decorum and hence deleted the X post attacking the teenager, but this is what the anti-snowflake movement has become: people who flip out over a politician’s anodyne self-deprecating joke and Democrats’ children doing normal things when caught on candid camera. This is late-stage MAGA. Some of the most vicious people in politics and commentary are unironically freaking out over people doing normal, apolitical things. They are irrationally hypersensitive, proclaiming their victimhood as they scour for woke scolds and creeping communism under every sofa cushion. It’s grievance culture of the right-wing variety. And it’s very weird."
Ruben Gallego's DNC speech highlighted an important truth about Latino voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-speech-ruben-gallego-arizona-latino-voters-rcna168044,"Now that the Democratic National Convention is over and the final leg of the 2024 presidential campaign season begins, it’s crystal clear that Vice President Kamala Harris is trending up with Latino voters.  Still, the question remains: Will it be enough in November? Before providing a possible answer, it’s essential to summarize why Democrats are back in the game regarding the country’s largest ethnic voting cohort, projected to be 36.2 million eligible voters this cycle, potentially resulting in a 6.5% turnout increase from 2020.  When President Joe Biden was still in the race, a post-debate Pew Research Center poll of Latino voters showed him tied at 36% nationally with Donald Trump. The way things were going, Biden was on course to get the least Latino support for a Democratic candidate since Jimmy Carter’s 56% in 1980. One month after Biden decided not to seek a second term, a new Pew poll had Harris with a 17-point lead (52% - 35%) over Trump. Although it is not the historical level of mid-60% Latino support for Democratic presidential candidates, and still below the Jimmy Carter number, it’s a dramatic swing in just one month. It also aligns with other Latino voters' polls from August, showing Harris making up most of the ground Biden lost and bringing on what one polling firm has called a “Latino reset.”  The news during DNC week continued that trend. Additional polling from Axios says Harris has “closed a 15-point enthusiasm gap with Latino voters in the weeks since President Biden dropped his re-election bid.” Data from two Latino organizations that work to increase Latino voter awareness echo the Axios enthusiasm findings, noting that “73% of registered Latino voters are almost certain they will vote in the 2024 Presidential election” and has Harris with a 59%-35% lead over Trump. On Wednesday morning, Voto Latino, an organization that endorsed Harris in July, revealed a new battleground state polling of Latinos, with Trump dropping to 29% and Harris reaching 60%. There is a lot at stake for Harris and Democrats. According to UnidosUS, 20% of Latinos will be voting for the first time in 2024. But that new, younger electorate is more politically independent than ever. New Latino voters don’t mean new Democratic voters. There is work to be done.  There is no guarantee that the Harris campaign will solidify more Latinos into the Democratic fold. For example, Wednesday night’s DNC tough-on-immigration talk and calls for a more balanced approach might align with where the majority of Latinos are these days, but the situation is complicated. This year, Democrats have had an uneasy stance on the issue. Even if Democrats featured several prominent Latino and Latino voices this week in Chicago, they are still sending mixed messages in the hopes of appealing to undecided Republicans and progressive Latino supporters.  So the question remains: Can Harris close the deal with Latinos and increase support? A Thursday prime-time podium speaker on track to become his state’s first Latino senator helped to answer that question. Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, a proud progressive, has consistently led opponent and Trump loyalist Kari Lake in all polling this summer. His DNC speech focused on his humble beginnings and how he eventually got accepted to Harvard and served in the Marines. Other Democratic officials who also served in the Armed Forces took the stage during Gallego’s speech, marking a moment. Importantly, Gallego never led with his Latino heritage. Rather, he presented himself to Democrats as a Senate candidate looking to expand his coalition, who happens to be Latino. The positive crowd response suggested that he has a winning formula not only for Latinos in his state but also Republicans and independents. And the key is a pivot to the middle that might rankle the Latino left, but delivers a working-class and populist message that Democrats need to keep hammering for the 11 weeks left until Election Day. Gallego hinted at this messaging earlier this year when he spoke to me, saying the “true Latino” vote in his state is “not influenced by an East Coast-West Coast bias that comes from the pundits,” and that, while “it comes from liberals sometimes, too. It also comes from conservatives.” Gallego’s focus on the military and veterans was politically smart. Immigration will always be a contentious issue, but don’t discount the Latino connection to the armed forces. According to a 2022 Department of Defense report, Latinos comprised 18.4% of active-duty members.  There are also economic messages Democrats tend to overlook when it comes to Latinos. For instance, little is being said about the 18 million new business applications under the Biden-Harris administration, with Latinos accounting for 40% of those numbers. Or how the Affordable Care Act has, according to the Biden-Harris administration, resulted in 15 million Latinos getting health insurance. The cost of living, the economy and health care are top issues for Latinos. There’s a reason why Trump and Republicans are trying to play up those topics with Latinos. And it is no coincidence that Gallego was on the main stage Thursday night, the same night Harris formally accepted the nomination. Arizona is a critical swing state and Gallego understands the messiness of Latinidad; he realizes that the Latino politically independent streak can benefit Democrats. No one group will propel Democrats to victory, but a coalition that expands the tent and admits that Latinos have indeed been taken for granted has a better shot. It’s a message Harris would be wise to use for the rest of her campaign if she wishes to continue trending up with an electorate that is such a vital part of the American vote."
Team Harris' DNC approach offered a classic lesson in political communication,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-dnc-masterclass-immigration-trump-rcna168037,"The Democratic National Convention was a joyful, inclusive reminder of what politics is supposed to feel like. And Vice President Kamala Harris ended the week by delivering a fierce, patriotic and refreshing speech that combined her positive vision for the country with an absolute takedown of Donald Trump. She looked and sounded like she was going to walk off that stage right into the Oval Office. But it’s important to remember that this race is far from over. It is going to be a grind. It is going to be nasty, and Trump and MAGA land are going to do everything they can to take her down. One of the issues the Trump campaign is betting on is immigration. But what this week also showed us is that Harris and her campaign are not going to avoid the hot-button topic. They are going to address it head-on. In her speech on Thursday, Harris smartly emphasized her border record and the ways she has advocated for increased security. She gave us a preview of how she will challenge Trump during the Sept. 10 presidential debate stage. “I refuse to play politics with our security,” she told the convention. “And here is my pledge to you: As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.” And this theme was present during earlier convention nights as well. Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar took the stage on Wednesday with a speech ready-made for a campaign ad. Salazar highlighted how Trump’s actions led to the collapse of the most prominent border reform bill in recent history. The appearance underscored how much Democrats do care about border security, and reaffirmed their commitment to the tough conversations. This strategy isn’t just talk. Rep. Tom Suozzi, who won a tough special election in February to replace GOP Rep. George Santos, successfully embraced this same strategy. He addressed immigration issues directly and demonstrated that Democrats can be both strong on security and compassionate in policy. This is a classic lesson in political communication: When facing a perceived weakness, confront it head-on. And on Wednesday and again on Thursday, we saw the Harris team do just that. On Sept. 5, Trump will host an event at his Bedminster golf club honoring those convicted for their roles in the 2021 Capitol attack. Billed as the “J6 Awards Gala,” the event will include a raffle for a plaque commemorating a song by Trump and the “J6 Prison Choir,” composed of Jan. 6 defendants. This gala is more than just a fundraiser. It’s also another warning highlighting Trump’s ongoing efforts to rewrite history. And it’s a chilling reminder of the lengths Trump will go to reshape reality. (Although with $400 million in legal fees hanging over his head, Trump could probably use a fundraising gala of his own). Coach Walz had us all feeling like Minnesota state champions when former members of his football team took the DNC stage on Wednesday night. Ben Ingman, a track athlete and former student of Walz’s, recalled the time his former teacher helped push Ingman’s car out of a snowbank, just one of many examples of Walz’s lifelong generosity. I spoke with both Ingman and Sean Kooman, a state champion kicker, on our show after their DNC appearance. “It really feels kind of like magic,” Kooman told me. “I’ve never met anybody with as much integrity as him.” This may be the most Americana DNC I’ve ever been a part of, and I’m here for it. Moments like these remind us what true leadership looks like: grounded in community, integrity and simple acts of kindness. As President Barack Obama said, Tim Walz is exactly the kind of person who should be in politics. This week Luke Russert, the host and creative director of MSNBC Live, wrote a powerful piece on the enduring significance of party conventions and why we shouldn’t take them for granted. During our conversation, I asked Luke about his experience at this DNC and why, like many of us, he was so deeply moved by Walz’s heartfelt speech. Reflecting on the moment, Luke said, “Anybody watching that with a soul left knows, ‘Hey, this is a good guy.’ The way his son just cheered for him brought me back to so many memories of my own childhood, cheering on my father, and knowing that my father loved me.” What show are you bingeing right now? My wife got me hooked on “Bridgerton,” which I should say I happily enjoyed. But the show I binge constantly and rewatch is “Conan O’Brien Must Go.” Conan’s humor is getting better with age. What’s the last book you read? I read two at the same time: An old-school gem “Post Office” by Charles Bukowski and a galley copy of “The Barn: A Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi” written by my friend Wright Thompson. “The Barn” comes out in a month and will be the book of the year. It’s the best thing I’ve read in quite a while. What time do you wake up on the weekends? Usually by 9:30 a.m. I’m a night owl so it can be a sliding scale, but my pug pretty much makes the call. How do you take your coffee? Black. But I’m very strange because I will drink one cup hot and then one iced right after, and for the rest of the day."
Beyoncé didn't show — but the DNC's celebrities blew the RNC's out of the water,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:26 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/beyonce-pink-dnc-celebrities-trump-rnc-rcna168029,"After hours of breathless speculation, deleted tweets and one very incorrect TMZ report, Beyoncé did not show up at the Democratic National Convention last night. It was a disappointing, if entirely predictable, outcome. And many, many other stars did grace the convention stage. Both Republican and Democratic convention organizers worked hard to secure headline-making names to drum up attention, followed hopefully by votes and possibly donations. But even without Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, it was clear that only one party truly understood the assignment. At the DNC, Democrats used celebrities across all four days to promote the specific policies of the party, and to connect each celebrity’s brand with their brand. On Thursday night, the convention featured Pink, a singer who has used her music to fight for LGBTQ+ equality long before it became fashionable, and The Chicks, who boldly risked their careers in country music to speak out against right-wing militarism.  Comedian D.L. Hughley, known for his clever commentary on race, took the stage to hilariously call out Trump’s race-baiting politics. Common and John Legend, both known for music that advocates and celebrates the quest for racial justice, took the stage earlier in the week. And Oprah Winfrey, an iconic figure who famously overcame the obstacles of race, class and gender to become a billionaire cultural behemoth, endorsed Harris’ historic quest to do the same. Trailblazing director Spike Lee watched from the crowd as barrier-breaking actresses Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling helped host. And heard throughout was the official campaign song, Beyoncé's “Freedom,” the rare instance of a singer and song matching the message and meaning of a political campaign. Contrast this with the strange Republican mélange of Kid Rock, Amber Rose, Russell Brand, reality star Savannah Chrisley, UFC head honcho Dana White and Hulk Hogan that assembled a few short weeks ago in Milwaukee. These celebrities didn’t reinforce any message or create any vibe. They certainly didn’t connect to any policy. Some seemed to contradict the actual policies of the reality TV candidate they were allegedly endorsing, leading to such outlandish moments as Amber Rose saying Trump is “all love.” Rose probably should have watched more of the actual RNC speakers, who spent much of the convention advocating for bigotry and hate. The biggest theme of the RNC celebrity choices, if you can call it a theme, was that “Trump is cool.” One could argue this is an actual political strategy, based on wooing young male voters. But even then, it’s unclear how widespread the 71-year-old Hulk Hogan’s fan base is anymore. Kid Rock has recently made more headlines for boycotting beer than he has for any particularly artistic endeavor. And Amber Rose is … barely a celebrity. This isn’t to say that Democrats always get celebrity politics right. As someone who worked on the 2016 Democratic convention, it’s clear to me now that we failed to connect many of the celebrities to any meaningful message or strategy. Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz performed, and both Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver took to the stage — but it wasn’t always clear why. What were they saying about the campaign Hillary Clinton was waging against Donald Trump? Similarly, when Robert De Niro showed up at Trump’s hush money trial, his appearance seemed like a tabloid distraction. A better strategy would have been to have a pro-choice female celebrity connect Trump’s sexist behavior with his sexist policies and discuss how Trump wants to put the government in our bedroom, while expecting privacy in his.  Why does any of this matter? We can never know for sure, but in the same way that Will Rogers’ everyman persona helped FDR position himself as the champion of ordinary Americans, or the Italian Catholic Frank Sinatra reinforced Irish Catholic JFK’s message of generational change, a good celebrity surrogate can complement, bolster and spread a candidate's message. And in the end, the DNC’s parade of celebrities did do a good job of connecting their own stories and star power to Harris’ message of “not going back.” Meanwhile, the celebrities at the RNC tried, and mostly failed, to make Trump look cool again. But to be fair to them, I’m not sure anybody could."
Ex-MMA fighter Ronda Rousey apologizes for once sharing a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ronda-rousey-sandy-hook-conspiracy-apology-rcna168002,"Ronda Rousey, a former professional mixed martial artist, apologized for amplifying a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory 11 years ago, after the incident resurfaced in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session earlier this week. In a lengthy statement she posted on social media Thursday night, Rousey recounted watching a conspiracy video about the mass shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were killed at a Connecticut elementary school, and then reposting the video on Twitter (now X) in early 2013. “I didn’t even believe it, but was so horrified at the truth that I was grasping for an alternative fiction to cling to instead,” she wrote. “I quickly realized my mistake and took it down, but the damage was done.” Rousey said her post went largely unnoticed by the media and she “never spoke of it again.” (It did spark some backlash at the time, and Rousey responded that she “never meant to hurt or insult anyone.”) She also said that she had “redrafted this apology” multiple times over the past 11 years. Rousey added: The Sandy Hook shooting is one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. Conspiracy theories about the massacre, often promoted by right-wing figures, have been rampant and are deeply damaging. Families of the victims and survivors have experienced death threats and harassment for years as a result. Infowars host Alex Jones was a major proponent of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories. After a prolonged legal battle with the victims’ families, Jones was ordered in 2022 to pay them a total of $1.5 billion in damages. In June this year, a judge granted his request to liquidate his personal assets to pay some of what he owed the families. Apologies from celebrities for public missteps can often come across as perfunctory exercises in damage control. Rousey’s statement comes more than a decade after her post and only after she was recently called out for it online. But, as far as such apologies go, her acknowledgement of the harm she caused and the repercussions she should have faced for it lend her apology a credibility others have lacked. Rousey also had some words of advice to those who have been taken in by conspiracy theories:"
Trump professes his love for dubious stop-and-frisk policing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 2:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-stop-frisk-new-york-police-fox-news-interview-rcna168003,"In a Fox News interview Thursday, Donald Trump all but guaranteed that a victory for him in November would lead to increased use of stop and frisk, the police practice known to facilitate racial profiling. The former president, who of course has been convicted of felonies himself, has endorsed the tactic in the past. He voiced support again Thursday while also endorsing the confiscation of guns, which certainly undercuts the GOP’s Second Amendment absolutism. During his meandering “Fox and Friends” interview, Trump said: Just like officials who have relied on stop-and-frisk policies over the years, Trump spoke in generalities to justify his approach. Police do not know everything about everyone walking down the street, and, in fact, there’s ample evidence that such stops are rather fruitless endeavors that do little to stem crime and often subject racial and ethnic minorities to bias and violations of their civil rights. The New York state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, for example, compiled data from the New York Police Department — which saw a federal judge find its stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional in 2013 — showing that the majority of the people stopped over the past two decades have been people of color and a “vastly disproportionate” number were Black. In addition, the ACLU found that the “overwhelming majority of people stopped by the NYPD have been innocent, meaning the NYPD found no evidence of wrongdoing and the civilian was not given a summons or arrested.” So why is Trump backing it? I suspect there are two reasons. First, Trump has been known to promote false and outright racist allegations about Black and Latino people on his own, so it follows that he would endorse a policy that allows police to do the same. And secondly, his claims about wanting police to be unencumbered helps distract some people from something we already know after his guilty verdicts and massive civil penalties: He doesn’t have any regard for the law."

At a speech during the Fed’s annual August summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell said ‘the time has come for policy to adjust.’ His remarks come as price growth has slowed and the jobs market, as well as demand for borrowing money, has begun to soften to a weaker level than before the onset of the pandemic.” * Ukraine steps up strikes in Russia: “As Ukrainian forces fight to isolate a large group of Russian soldiers caught between a river in Russia’s Kursk Province and the Ukrainian border, Kyiv has launched a series of strikes at airfields, ports and oil depots in other regions of Russia aimed at degrading the Kremlin’s war effort.” * Difficult diplomacy: “The White House said Friday that cease-fire talks in Cairo have been constructive and will continue over the weekend as the U.S. and Mideast allies continue to press Israel and Hamas to forge an agreement. CIA Director William Burns and Brett McGurk, a senior adviser on the Middle East to President Joe Biden, are leading the U.S. side of negotiations that began on Thursday amid major differences between Israel and Hamas over Israel’s insistence that it maintain forces in two strategic corridors in Gaza.” * A case worth watching: “Texas and 15 other Republican-led states sued the Biden administration on Friday seeking to halt a new program that could give legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens. Filed just days after the program opened for applications, the lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal actions Texas has led challenging federal immigration policies and powers.” * This NLRB story was overshadowed this week, but it’s important: “Prosecutors at a federal labor agency have determined that Amazon is a joint employer of subcontracted drivers who delivered packages for the company in California, pushing back on claims from the online retailer that they are not its employees. The decision, made by a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles, came after the agency investigated unfair labor practice charges filed against the company by the Teamsters union.” * The latest Jan. 6 arrest: “A live-streamer who was a frequent presence at the ‘Freedom Corner’ protests in support of Jan. 6 defendants has been arrested on Capitol attack charges, nearly two years after he was publicly identified by online ‘sedition hunters’ who have aided in hundreds of Jan. 6 arrests.” * In related news: “A Maryland man who threw a smoke bomb at police officers defending the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and who later became a police officer himself in Montgomery County, was convicted Friday of civil disorder, assaulting police and other charges.” * The governor might need to pick up a new hobby: “Data obtained by NBC News seems to indicate that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott did not send a single bus full of migrants out of the state in July, despite his vow at the Republican National Convention on July 17 to keep sending buses north until the border is ‘secure.’” Have a safe weekend."
"Trump's 'dog' insults come back to bite him as he courts Kennedy, Kemp support",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 2:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-kemp-kennedy-like-a-dog-rcna168016,"Donald Trump has a phrase he likes to use to describe people he believes are in weak, pitiful or even servile positions: “Like a dog.”  As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out in 2020, Trump has used the phrase to attack a host of people, from retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal (who was “fired like a dog”) to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who was “dumped like a dog”) and conservative activist Brent Bozell (who was once “begging for money like a dog”).  It seems fitting to revive the phrase now that the tables have turned on Trump, who’s exhibited some canine qualities of his own recently by nuzzling up to some of the men he’s barked at in the past. With Kamala Harris atop the Democratic ticket, and an election victory more in doubt, Trump now appears more willing to roll over for people who previously drew his ire.  Take Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, for example. For years now, Trump has publicly attacked Kemp for refusing to help overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory in Georgia, and he publicly bashed the governor and his wife earlier this month, prompting Kemp to tell Trump to “leave my family out of it.” Many Republicans said Trump’s outburst might hurt his election chances in Georgia. And whether it was that, the palpable energy of Georgia’s Democratic National Convention delegation, or recent polling data forecasting a close race in Georgia, Trump's tweet touting Kemp suggests he’s feeling the heat. He said: That’s a good boy who's learned to muzzle himself ... for now. Perhaps some belly scratches are on the way. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, spoke with Kemp the night before Trump praised him, CNN reported. (Neither NBC News nor MSNBC has independently confirmed that report.) Perhaps Vance's reported visit was meant to smooth things over? Either way, we’ve seen a similar about-face from Trump when it comes to Trump’s stance on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier this year, Trump’s strategy for combating Kennedy’s independent presidential bid, and its appeal to some Trump voters, involved lobbing personal attacks at Kennedy and his family. But since entering the race, polling suggests Harris is winning over some independent voters, making Kennedy’s candidacy all the more perilous for Trump’s campaign. That likely explains why Trump reportedly spoke with Kennedy recently to discuss a potential Cabinet position should Kennedy drop out of the race. On Friday, Kennedy withdrew from the race, stating in a speech that Trump had asked to ""enlist me in his administration."" He went on endorse Trump in his speech. A day earlier, Trump called into Fox News and heaped praise on Kennedy: These are the kinds of fawning statements one might expect from a candidate who — much like the “dogs” he despises — has been brought to heel."
This was the most effective line from Kamala Harris' DNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 2:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-prosecutor-donald-trump-rcna168015,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 23 episode of “Morning Joe.” Donald Trump woke up to some bad news this morning. Overnight, following a blockbuster speech at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala became the candidate of change.  I’m sure that terrifies the Trump campaign. If you look historically at presidential elections, people who make up their minds at the end tend to go toward the candidate they think is most likely to change things. Right now, that’s not Trump. The most effective way Harris made her case to the American people on Thursday was how she connected the stages of her career with a common purpose. During her time as a prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator, and then a vice president, Harris noted that she “only had one client: the people.” She contrasted that directly with Trump, declaring “the only client he has ever had: himself.” I’m sure the Harris campaign was very happy to wake up to headlines across the country about the “new way forward.” She is no longer just somebody who is the vice president. She is a presidential candidate.  This week, Democrats pulled off what many thought was impossible for a sitting vice president — taking away the cloak of incumbency. Kamala Harris is now the new kid in town.

The Democratic National Convention reached a crescendo Thursday when Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination. Throughout the week, it’s been clear to me that everyone in that building — and definitely everyone on the stage — understood the assignment in front of them. They know there’s a fight ahead, one that's approaching fast. In some states, voters can cast their ballot as soon as early September. Make no mistake, this is going to be a close election. When President Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, I was one of the people who believed the race between him and former President Donald Trump was so close not because people didn’t like Biden but because they liked what Trump was selling. While some moments this week felt like a huge celebration, the vice president didn’t go out there Thursday and take a victory lap. She went out there and told people who she was, what she believed, where she stood on a number of key policy issues and what kind of president she would be. She talked about the threat of a second Trump presidency and she laid out the argument against him. She essentially said, “I’m a patriot. He is not. I will defend this country. He will not. I am like you. He is not like us.” During her speech, Harris looked like she was going to work. She looked like she could step off that stage and go straight into the situation room. That is the tone and tenor that Democrats need to carry over into these next couple of weeks because, between now and November, they’re going to have to fight for this victory.

The Supreme Court is a wild card on voting in the 2024 election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 1:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-2024-election-trump-arizona-rcna167954,"The Supreme Court didn’t give Republicans everything they wanted this week when it only partially granted their bid to enforce an Arizona law requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voting. The court rejected the emergency appeal to enforce state law to a degree that could have more clearly disenfranchised voters in the battleground state in this year’s presidential election. But even then, Republican-appointed Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch noted that they would have fully granted the request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republican officials. So, what does this mixed ruling portend for the seemingly inevitable legal fights to come in what may be a close election in November? It’s hard to know, exactly. That makes the high court a wild-card factor in the election, one in which Donald Trump’s possibly dimming prospects against an energized Democratic ticket could lead the GOP to lean on the courts even more heavily this year. Taking a closer look at the court’s order in the Arizona case, called RNC v. Mi Familia Vota, shows how the justices splintered in the appeal and how they may continue to divide going forward. The court didn’t explain itself, which isn’t entirely unusual for emergency appeals on the court’s so-called shadow docket. But the lack of expressed reasoning raises questions about what’s happening at the court and what’s to come. In addition to the order noting that Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch would have fully granted the GOP application, it further noted that Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have fully denied it. The votes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh aren’t listed on the order, putting them in the middle of the action. While it would have been good to know the reasoning underlying all the justices’ votes, it would have been especially worthwhile to see Roberts’ and Kavanaugh’s deciding rationale. Those two justices haven’t always sided with their fellow GOP appointees in voting cases, as shown by a surprise 5-4 ruling last year authored by Roberts and joined by Kavanaugh and the court’s three Democratic appointees. An issue underlying this Arizona litigation and voting cases generally is the degree to which courts can alter rules close to elections — what’s known as the “Purcell principle,” which is supposed to discourage changes close to elections to avoid confusion, but the Roberts Court has applied it inconsistently over the years. In the Arizona case, the two blocks of justices who noted their votes seemingly fall on different sides of the issue — though, again, neither block offered a written explanation. Perhaps more importantly, it’s unclear how Roberts or Kavanaugh arrived at their split decision, making it unclear how future voting appeals will be resolved as we head toward November, with three justices potentially prepared to go as far as Republicans want them to.
