0,Here's what Kamala Harris has to do in high-stakes sit-down interview,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 13:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-tim-walz-interview-donald-trump-rcna168274,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 25 episode of ""Alex Witt Reports."" This week, Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to sit down for her first interview as a presidential candidate. Since entering the race, Harris has been criticized for her lack of interviews and press conferences. Earlier this month, she promised to sit down for an interview by the end of August. With less than a week to go, NBC News is now reporting Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, will take part in a joint interview in the coming days, though it’s unclear with whom or precisely when that will happen.   This first interview is critically important for the Harris campaign. It could help keep up the incredible momentum she’s built since entering the race. It’s also a very important moment for the country. Republicans and Democrats alike need to see Harris engaged in an interview with a sober, serious reporter. She needs to be asked tough questions and provide answers to the American people — on the record. Have any of her policy positions shifted since she ran for president in 2019? If so, why did those shifts occur? I’m sure she’ll get pressed on her role within the Biden-Harris administration on hot-button issues like immigration and the border. She may even get questions on foreign policy and the Afghanistan withdrawal.   But, in some ways, it’s more about how the vice president answers these questions than the actual answers themselves. There will likely be some uncomfortable moments for Harris, but it’s those moments that are the most important. The American people need to see how she handles being asked tough questions and how she reacts under pressure.  The Trump campaign’s first attack ad against Harris included an exchange between the vice president and NBC News’ Lester Holt during a 2021 interview. When Harris was asked by Holt why she had not visited the border as vice president she quipped back that she had also not been to Europe. Is that the Harris we’ll see this week — defensive under pressure? Or will we see the strength and directness she’s displayed over the last four weeks? "
1,"Trump howls as Harris, Dems turn him into the 2024 incumbent",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 11:36:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-howls-harris-dems-turn-2024-incumbent-rcna168276,"During the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters didn’t literally describe Donald Trump as an incumbent, but it was a message the party was eager to convey. Over the weekend, the former president added text to the subtext. “Kamala and her ‘handlers’ are trying to make it sound like I am the Incumbent President,” the Republican whined early Saturday at 1:15 a.m. He’s not the only one who’s noticed. TPM’s Josh Marshall summarized: I can appreciate why this is exasperating to the GOP nominee and his supporters. Harris is, after all, the incumbent vice president. She’s also the candidate offering American voters a breath of fresh air and a “new way forward,” as the Democrat put it in her convention speech. To a very real degree, Trump brought this on himself, pretending he won the 2020 race, asking that he be described as “Mr. President,” meeting with foreign officials as a matter of course, banishing the word “former” from his title, etc. But there’s more to it than that. As Off Message’s Brian Beutler noted in his latest column: Quite right. Trump grudgingly exited the White House in January 2021, but in the months and years that followed, he not only retook control of his political party, he also remained a dominant voice in the American discourse, en route to cruising through GOP primaries and caucuses, becoming his party’s presidential nominee for the third consecutive cycle. As a legal and official matter, the Republican has no more authority than you or I. He can’t sign or veto bills. He can’t issue executive orders. He is a private citizen with no powers to speak of. But it’s hardly unreasonable to conclude that we’re mired in the Trump era of American politics. And that, in turn, is precisely why Harris has an advantage as the candidate of change. The message to the electorate couldn’t be more straightforward: 2024 offers a unique opportunity to bring the Trump era to an end and usher in something new."
2,"Lawyers from Reagan, Bush administrations endorse Harris in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 08:15:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/lawyers-reagan-bush-administrations-endorse-harris-2024-race-rcna168217,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his presidential campaign on Friday and threw his support behind Donald Trump’s Republican candidacy. Time will tell whether this affects the 2024 race in any meaningful way, though at face value, the significance of the developments seemed limited: The independent conspiracy theorist has never held public office. His notoriety comes from being a lawyer with a famous name. Around the same time as Kennedy’s news, however, some lawyers who lack famous names made a notable endorsement of their own. Fox News reported: “We endorse Kamala Harris and support her election as President because we believe that returning former President Trump to office would threaten American democracy and undermine the rule of law in our country,” the lawyers wrote in a letter that the signatories shared first with Fox News Digital. The signatories added that “we urge all patriotic Republicans, former Republicans, conservative and center-right citizens, and independent voters to place love of country above party and ideology and join us in supporting Kamala Harris.” The same joint statement went on to remind the public, “Donald Trump’s own Vice President and multiple members of his Administration and White House Staff at the most senior levels — as well as former Republican nominees for President and Vice President — have already declined to endorse his reelection.” “Trump’s attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after losing the election proved beyond any reasonable doubt his willingness to place his personal interests above the law and values of our constitutional democracy,” the Reagan and Bush administration lawyers added. “We cannot go along with other former Republican officials who have condemned Trump with these devastating judgments but are still not willing to vote for Harris. We believe this election presents a binary choice, and Trump is utterly disqualified.” They concluded that the GOP nominee is “guilty of grave wrongdoing to our Constitution, democracy, and rule of law, and who remains unfit, dangerous, and detached from reality.” The endorsement from Friday came on the heels of Harris also picking up a variety of other Republican endorsements and Democrats including some GOP speakers at the party’s convention in Chicago. Indeed, Friday’s bookend endorsements were emblematic of the broader message the Harris campaign wants to convey to the electorate: Trump picked up support from a fringe anti-vaccine activist, while the Democratic nominee received support from lawyers from Republican administrations who want to put country over party. For Democrats pushing the “normal vs. weird” message, the developments were entirely on-message."
3,"Democrats, stop calling the Harris-Trump race ‘the prosecutor’ vs. ‘the felon’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-prosecutor-felon-democrats-rcna167349,"Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, some Democrats have summarized her matchup against former President Donald Trump as “the prosecutor” versus “the felon.” On the day that President Joe Biden passed the baton to Harris, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said of her, “She is a prosecutor running against a felon.” At last week’s Democratic convention, speakers including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Biden embraced that framing. In defending his record on public safety, Biden said Monday, “And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.” The prosecutor versus the felon is the kind of glib expression that’s perfect for an election-year bumper sticker. However, the suggestion that a “felon” is inherently and permanently untrustworthy makes for a heaping helping of hypocrisy from a party that has rightly identified overcriminalization, mass incarceration and voter suppression as systemic problems. Yes, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts in May. Were it not for a Georgia prosecutor’s affair with a lawyer she hired, a Trump appointee in Florida entertaining his ridiculous motions and a Supreme Court that seems bent on rejecting the whole theory of America, he may have been convicted of up to 54 more. That said, Trump showed his manifest unfitness for office long before any of those indictments. He exhibited it during his first campaign, during his term in office, while campaigning as an incumbent and no more so than by rejecting his status as a lame duck. And he is further demonstrating that unfitness during this, his third campaign for president. But to label him a felon and use it to mean unfitness is to suggest that all “felons,” by their very nature, are bad and irredeemable. A political slogan can’t communicate every nuance. But at a minimum, it shouldn’t send a message inconsistent with the party’s stated values. There has been a conscious effort in recent years — no doubt derided by detractors as “woke” — to refrain from using language that dehumanizes people and reduces them to their status or their circumstances. Say “enslaved people,” not “slaves.” Say “incarcerated people,” not “prisoners” or “inmates.” Again, there are critics of such constructions, and, without a doubt, those constructions make for clunkier sentences. But the point remains that people who have experienced a thing are far more than the thing they’ve experienced. Consider the lawyer, poet and writer Reginald Dwayne Betts, as brilliant a person as you’ll find in this country. Before he wrote three acclaimed books of poetry and a memoir, and before his genius was recognized by the MacArthur Foundation, he spent years in prison for a violent carjacking he committed when he was 16. When discussing the title of his 2019 volume of poetry, Betts told NPR, “It’s called ‘Felon.’ But the thing is, ‘felon’ is just such an inadequate description of anybody.” Those using the “prosecutor vs. felon” dichotomy appear unaware of the inadequacy of that framing. They may believe themselves to be making a commentary only about Trump. But they are betraying a belief that the word “felon” tells you everything you’ll ever need to know about a person. And, to repeat, they’re undercutting their arguments against less punitive sentences and their arguments against letting people who’ve served their time vote again. If all felons are bad, then why should we fight for their right to participate in elections? Let’s set aside the fact that some people convicted of felonies aren’t guilty and, for argument’s sake, assume that everyone so labeled committed a significant crime. Even then, the list of felons would include good people who did uncharacteristically awful things, sometimes accidental things. That list would also include people who were horrible human beings and turned their lives around. And, yes, it would include people like Trump, that is, people we know would commit the same crimes again if given the chance. The argument against Trump, therefore, isn’t that he has a record. It’s that he’s unrepentant: a mendacious, self-seeking narcissist who has never evinced a shred of self-reflection or regret. It’s that he never has been, and likely never will be, deserving of anybody’s trust, let alone the country’s trust. As a veteran journalist, I have known a significant number of elected officials who have gone to prison. Not only that, but I’ve watched a few of them re-emerge, return to the game of politics and even run for office again. One of them once requested a meeting with me where he asked how I squared my belief in second chances with my opposition to his candidacy. Easily. My belief that people shouldn’t be forever punished doesn’t mean I think people who have been criminally punished and then run for office are automatically due political support. It doesn’t mean I think they’re good people. There are people I’d consider voting for even if they have gone to prison, and others I’d never consider even if they haven’t. Under no circumstances would the Democrats throwing around the word “felon” have considered voting for him even if a jury hadn’t found him guilty. That’s because they’re not opposed to Trump because he’s a “felon.” They’re opposed to Trump because he’s Trump."
4,Team Harris' DNC approach offered a classic lesson in political communication,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-24 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-dnc-masterclass-immigration-trump-rcna168037,"The Democratic National Convention was a joyful, inclusive reminder of what politics is supposed to feel like. And Vice President Kamala Harris ended the week by delivering a fierce, patriotic and refreshing speech that combined her positive vision for the country with an absolute takedown of Donald Trump. She looked and sounded like she was going to walk off that stage right into the Oval Office. But it’s important to remember that this race is far from over. It is going to be a grind. It is going to be nasty, and Trump and MAGA land are going to do everything they can to take her down. One of the issues the Trump campaign is betting on is immigration. But what this week also showed us is that Harris and her campaign are not going to avoid the hot-button topic. They are going to address it head-on. In her speech on Thursday, Harris smartly emphasized her border record and the ways she has advocated for increased security. She gave us a preview of how she will challenge Trump during the Sept. 10 presidential debate stage. “I refuse to play politics with our security,” she told the convention. “And here is my pledge to you: As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.” And this theme was present during earlier convention nights as well. Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar took the stage on Wednesday with a speech ready-made for a campaign ad. Salazar highlighted how Trump’s actions led to the collapse of the most prominent border reform bill in recent history. The appearance underscored how much Democrats do care about border security, and reaffirmed their commitment to the tough conversations. This strategy isn’t just talk. Rep. Tom Suozzi, who won a tough special election in February to replace GOP Rep. George Santos, successfully embraced this same strategy. He addressed immigration issues directly and demonstrated that Democrats can be both strong on security and compassionate in policy. This is a classic lesson in political communication: When facing a perceived weakness, confront it head-on. And on Wednesday and again on Thursday, we saw the Harris team do just that. On Sept. 5, Trump will host an event at his Bedminster golf club honoring those convicted for their roles in the 2021 Capitol attack. Billed as the “J6 Awards Gala,” the event will include a raffle for a plaque commemorating a song by Trump and the “J6 Prison Choir,” composed of Jan. 6 defendants. This gala is more than just a fundraiser. It’s also another warning highlighting Trump’s ongoing efforts to rewrite history. And it’s a chilling reminder of the lengths Trump will go to reshape reality. (Although with $400 million in legal fees hanging over his head, Trump could probably use a fundraising gala of his own). Coach Walz had us all feeling like Minnesota state champions when former members of his football team took the DNC stage on Wednesday night. Ben Ingman, a track athlete and former student of Walz’s, recalled the time his former teacher helped push Ingman’s car out of a snowbank, just one of many examples of Walz’s lifelong generosity. I spoke with both Ingman and Sean Kooman, a state champion kicker, on our show after their DNC appearance. “It really feels kind of like magic,” Kooman told me. “I’ve never met anybody with as much integrity as him.” This may be the most Americana DNC I’ve ever been a part of, and I’m here for it. Moments like these remind us what true leadership looks like: grounded in community, integrity and simple acts of kindness. As President Barack Obama said, Tim Walz is exactly the kind of person who should be in politics. This week Luke Russert, the host and creative director of MSNBC Live, wrote a powerful piece on the enduring significance of party conventions and why we shouldn’t take them for granted. During our conversation, I asked Luke about his experience at this DNC and why, like many of us, he was so deeply moved by Walz’s heartfelt speech. Reflecting on the moment, Luke said, “Anybody watching that with a soul left knows, ‘Hey, this is a good guy.’ The way his son just cheered for him brought me back to so many memories of my own childhood, cheering on my father, and knowing that my father loved me.” What show are you bingeing right now? My wife got me hooked on “Bridgerton,” which I should say I happily enjoyed. But the show I binge constantly and rewatch is “Conan O’Brien Must Go.” Conan’s humor is getting better with age. What’s the last book you read? I read two at the same time: An old-school gem “Post Office” by Charles Bukowski and a galley copy of “The Barn: A Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi” written by my friend Wright Thompson. “The Barn” comes out in a month and will be the book of the year. It’s the best thing I’ve read in quite a while. What time do you wake up on the weekends? Usually by 9:30 a.m. I’m a night owl so it can be a sliding scale, but my pug pretty much makes the call. How do you take your coffee? Black. But I’m very strange because I will drink one cup hot and then one iced right after, and for the rest of the day."
5,This was the most effective line from Kamala Harris' DNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 14:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-prosecutor-donald-trump-rcna168015,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 23 episode of “Morning Joe.” Donald Trump woke up to some bad news this morning. Overnight, following a blockbuster speech at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala became the candidate of change.  I’m sure that terrifies the Trump campaign. If you look historically at presidential elections, people who make up their minds at the end tend to go toward the candidate they think is most likely to change things. Right now, that’s not Trump. The most effective way Harris made her case to the American people on Thursday was how she connected the stages of her career with a common purpose. During her time as a prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator, and then a vice president, Harris noted that she “only had one client: the people.” She contrasted that directly with Trump, declaring “the only client he has ever had: himself.” I’m sure the Harris campaign was very happy to wake up to headlines across the country about the “new way forward.” She is no longer just somebody who is the vice president. She is a presidential candidate.  This week, Democrats pulled off what many thought was impossible for a sitting vice president — taking away the cloak of incumbency. Kamala Harris is now the new kid in town.

6,Kamala Harris' DNC acceptance speech didn't overlook the Supreme Court's significance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 08:28:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kamala-harris-dnc-acceptance-speech-supreme-court-rcna167929,"Even if she only mentioned it a couple of times, the Supreme Court loomed large in Kamala Harris’ speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago on Thursday night. After all, she addressed two of the biggest rulings in recent years, both of which involve the Republican presidential nominee: the court’s broad grant of criminal immunity for presidents and its stripping of abortion rights.  On immunity, Harris cast the decision in Trump v. United States as the foundation for an even more dangerous second Trump term if he wins in November: “Consider the power he will have, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States.”  Harris’ general description of the ruling — “that he would be immune from criminal prosecution” — triggered some fact-checkers, who noted that the high court’s ruling is technically more complex than her summary. But while adding context about the ruling is theoretically helpful — that he’s absolutely immune for “core” constitutional acts, presumptively immune for all official acts but not immune for unofficial ones — the reality is that the extent of Trump’s immunity is yet to be determined.  The federal election interference case is now back in the trial court, where U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan will attempt to apply the new immunity test to Trump’s Washington, D.C., indictment in the first instance, after which the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority may have the last word on what its vague ruling means in practice. That is, unless Trump wins in November — in which case the prosecution is good as gone and we may never know how criminally immune the Roberts Court believes Trump to be. At any rate, Harris’ statement about Trump lacking guardrails thanks to the immunity ruling may turn out to be prescient if he’s re-elected. However vague the court’s ruling, it could provide Trump more of a roadmap for how to use the awesome power of the presidency to his personal advantage while minimizing criminal exposure. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in Trump v. United States didn’t meaningfully address Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s warning in dissent that presidents can now, for example, order Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival or organize a military coup to hold onto power with impunity.    The Democratic nominee also highlighted the high court’s wreckage on abortion: “But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear about how we got here: Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.” Indeed, Trump appointed three of the five justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022’s Dobbs decision.  Harris’ highlighting of both crucial rulings reminds us that the court is also on the ballot in November.

7,"In convention speech, Kamala Harris succeeded where Trump failed",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 05:55:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/convention-speech-kamala-harris-succeeded-trump-failed-rcna167918,"On July 18, Donald Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention, where the former president was expected to deliver one of the most important speeches of his political career. He failed spectacularly: The GOP candidate spoke for more than an hour and a half, reminding voters of all the things they don’t like about him and failing to take advantage of a unique opportunity. Trump meandered aimlessly. He ad-libbed unnecessarily. He lied excessively. He was in equal measures divisive, bitter, juvenile, conspiratorial and alienating. The Republican nominee effectively presented a case study in how not to deliver an acceptance speech at a major party convention. Exactly six weeks later, Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Her remarks were not just a triumph on their own terms, they also succeeded where her Republican rival failed. NBC News reported: Why did her convention speech work? Harris presented herself as the change candidate: That’s not an easy thing for an incumbent vice president to pull off, but the Democrat’s “new way forward” rhetoric resonated in part because she’s running against a failed GOP candidate who’s led his party’s ticket in every election since 2016. Worse, Trump is explicitly running on a platform of taking the nation backwards, while Harris repeatedly used the word ""forward"" in her remarks. Harris reached out to a broad electorate: Six weeks after Trump’s needlessly divisive remarks, the Democratic nominee declared, “I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self.” In the same remarks, she added, “Our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past — a chance to chart a new way forward — not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” Harris was optimistic and patriotic: “[O]ur opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is,” the vice president said. “Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: Freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities. We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.” Harris sounded like a normal human being: While Trump raged on his social media platform, the Democratic nominee assured voters, “I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense.” Harris was disciplined — and didn’t go on and on: Trump’s 90-minute rant in Milwaukee sent some of his loyalists heading for the exits before it was over. The vice president’s remarks, in contrast, were half as long. The former abandoned his script to share strange thoughts that popped into his mind; the latter recognized the importance of being a disciplined candidate for the nation’s highest office. I won’t pretend to know what’s going to happen on Election Day 2024, but as the dust settles in Chicago, Harris has reason to feel good about her chances."
8,The GOP’s racist attacks on Kamala Harris reveal a painful paradox for people like me,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-black-indian-race-trump-rcna167777,"In her rousing Democratic National Convention address Thursday night, Vice President Kamala Harris paid homage to her mother's determination, “traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream.” I, like Harris, am a mixed-race South Asian. My father is Pakistani and my mother is Caucasian (mostly British, though born and raised in Southern Africa). And the tired racialized narratives about Harris’ identity are familiar, echoing narratives and projections about my own identity that I’ve navigated throughout my life. The untidiness of mixed-race identities and the discomfort that produces foregrounds our collective preoccupation with categorizing and ordering people, an often dehumanizing process — not to mention, a stubborn relic of the colonial episteme.  According to her detractors, Harris is either “too Black” or “too Indian” or not enough of either. In the words of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, she “is a fundamentally fake person.” “I believe that Kamala Harris is whatever she says she is,” Vance said in an interview with CNN earlier this month. “She pretends to be one thing in front of one audience. She pretends to be something different in front of another audience.” “Is Kamala a chameleon? Is she Indian?” cried former wrestling star and MAGA fanboy Hulk Hogan in a video obtained by TMZ. He followed this with a racist, so-called Native American greeting. (Hulk, are you OK?)  More than anything, these examples evince to me just how unstable racial categories are. Mixed-race folx are often reduced to a binaristic paradigm — they are either too much of one thing or not enough of either. Or, paradoxically, they are both at the same time.  Throughout my life, I have been told I am not white enough. I am not brown enough. Or I am too brown. Though, interestingly, never too white. The one-drop rule, a Jim Crow-era law which stipulated that even one drop of blood from a Black ancestor made someone Black (as though it is a contamination), seems alive and well in how we collectively define mixed-race people today — especially if you present as anything other than white. (Colorism is an entirely different dimension of this.) And these narratives insist we are “whole of nothing.” It’s important to note that Harris’ lived experience is different in a multitude of ways, not least because she is competing with being two different kinds of minorities, contending with the heavy burden of historical racism around Blackness in this country and the suspicion of being an Indian foreigner. Suffice it to say, conversations around mixed-race identity are infused with covert white supremacy. One way I encounter it, for example, is in the refusal to accept mixed-race people, who are partially white, as white.  I’ve been told by white people that I profit off of being brown (the “DEI accusation” levied by white people who feel that minorities can bypass meritocracy, which is itself a fallacy). It’s as though the world — built on tenuous, stratifying racial paradigms — cannot handle the embodiment of identities that destabilize these paradigms. We saw this discomfort play out a few weeks ago when Trump questioned whether Harris was “Black enough.”  “She was only promoting Indian heritage,” Trump said in an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “Is she Indian or is she Black?” That preposterous question perfectly captures the discomfort produced in many by the existence of mixed-race people, who embody experiences and/or identities that challenge our racial ordering.   My experience as a mixed-race person makes me reflect on racial formation theory, a framework introduced by sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant in the 1980s, which postulates “that ‘race’ is a social and political reality that remains unfixed, due to the role of institutions and groups in shaping its meaning,” sociologist Eileen O’Brien explains in “The Cambridge Handbook of Sociology.” Mixed-race people both highlight the instability of racial categories and further destabilize these ideologies. However, it’s worth noting that, like most things that emerged in the ‘80s, we should take this with a grain of salt. For example, detractors, such as sociologists Joe Feagin and Sean Elias, argue that the theory doesn’t do enough to decenter whiteness. “[R]acial formation theory inadequately explains: racial meanings and white racial framing; US society’s racial foundation; the US state and other sites of racial contestation; whites’ and white elites’ centrality in contemporary racism; challenges to a racially pluralistic democracy; and group resistance to racism, especially that of the black ‘radical’ intellectual tradition,” they write in “Rethinking Racial Formation Theory: A Systemic Racism Critique.” Nonetheless, Omi and Winant’s contributions were critical in exposing the instability and sophism of racial categories, which, of course, continue to haunt us to this day. I don’t find the current mainstream discourse around Harris (and other mixed-race folx) useful — applying racial litmus tests and debating to what extent she and others like her qualify for certain groups and identities. But I do find conversations about my identity as a mixed-race person useful when it’s self-reflexive and when they help situate me in terms of intersectionality. For example, I’m interested in discussing how being half-white provided me with the cultural capital that helped me be admitted into and navigate the elite institutions I’ve attended for my undergraduate and graduate studies, even as I’m read as brown. Being half-white has afforded me extraordinary privileges. But/and how much was my drive to attend such institutions born from a compensatory and perfectionist part, burdened by my own experiences with racism, that believes I am less-than because I am brown and that I must excel in order to be worthy?  My brother and I had many of the same socioeconomic privileges as my white cousins, for example, which my brown cousins have not had. Conversely, we were unable to visit South Africa, where my mother was primarily raised, and meet my family there until after 1994, because of apartheid and the enforced segregation. My white cousins were able to make that trip years before my brother and I were. The point is, it’s messy and complex and nuanced.  These are the kinds of mainstream conversations that I believe we should be having about Harris’ identity, through the prism of intersectionality — conversations that allow us to interrogate shifting power dynamics and the instability of racial categories. This, I believe, would serve us all well. But questioning whether Harris is Black enough or Indian enough is not in service of anything — except white supremacy."
9,Kamala Harris wasn’t taking any chances in her DNC speech — but that’s why it worked,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 22:24:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-acceptance-speech-dnc-democratic-convention-rcna167674,"The 2024 Democratic National Convention is over, and despite fears of intraparty fighting and violent clashes between police and protesters outside the United Center — this was not a replay of 1968. In fact, Lil Jon’s roll call cameo notwithstanding, it was about as basic as political conventions get. And that’s probably the best Democrats could hope for.  The crowd in Chicago’s United Center roared as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for president. It’s a historic moment and one that clearly inspired a lot of emotion. The cameras found more than a few non-dry eyes in the house.  But like the convention itself, Harris’ speech was successful in large part because she played it kind of safe.  She wished her husband, “Dougie” Emhoff, a happy 10th anniversary. She told a compelling personal story about being a child of immigrants who traveled the world to work for the American dream — and succeeded. And she spoke about her distinguished career as a prosecutor who always showed up “for the people.” Then there was the Donald Trump part of the speech. Here, Harris hit the necessary notes — reminding voters that Trump “tried to throw away your votes” during his monthslong attempt to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. And, oh yeah, that he’s been convicted of felonies and found liable for sexual abuse. (I know we’re almost a decade into the Trump era, but it still blows my mind how these brief nuggets of his recent bio are seen as little more than campaign talking points by much of the American electorate.) Harris also highlighted arguably Trump’s most important political victory — getting three justices onto the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Harris spoke of the consequences of Trump’s legacy, including “women miscarrying in a parking lot, getting sepsis, losing their ability to ever have children again, all because doctors are afraid of going to jail for caring for their patients.” And, in a callback to one of the most affecting segments of the DNC, Harris spoke of “children who have survived sexual assault, potentially forced to carry the pregnancy to term. This is what is happening in our country. Because of Donald Trump.”  Harris’ rhetorical assaults on Trump were absolutely the high point of the speech. She articulated the verifiable threats Trump poses to democracy, the global order and the rights of everyday Americans in succinct, pugnacious fashion.  When it came to policy specifics, it didn’t sound like much of a departure from Joe Biden’s agenda. There was lots of talk about “the middle class” and Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires.  But Harris was completely vague about building what she called an “opportunity economy” that, under her leadership, would bring together “labor and workers, small-business owners and entrepreneurs, and American companies.” How she’d bring together these often competing forces — and what “bringing together” even means — remains unexplained.  And on an evening dubbed by some social media smart alecks as “normie night” — the one night when less partisan people would likely be tuned in — the program was stuffed with police officers, ex-Republicans, moderates and foreign policy tough talk.  In this vein, Harris assured the normies that, unlike Trump, she would not abandon NATO and that “as commander in chief I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Republicans have for decades portrayed Democrats as lacking the killer instinct to deal with the worst actors on the international stage. This was Harris’ moment to let the undecideds know that she understands the threats posed by Iran and China, while adding that she wouldn’t be reckless and impulsive with that power — like Trump. Then came the Gaza part of the speech. The lack of a Palestinian American speaker or any representative from the Uncommitted delegation was the elephant in the room, and after a staunch defense of Israel’s right to defend itself and a condemnation of the terrorist organization Hamas, Harris spoke of the civilian suffering in Gaza. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” Again, when getting specific, it didn’t appear that Harris’ policy is any different from Biden’s: “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity. Security. Freedom. And self-determination.”  Team Harris is most likely hoping that her stated commitments to work for a cease-fire and a Palestinian state — especially given the fact that her opponent openly uses the word “Palestinian” as an insult — will be enough to temporarily quell the dissatisfaction from the party’s progressive wing and get it out to vote in November. We will, fairly soon, find out. Over the course of four often long nights, Harris and Democrats made history this week. Along the way, America heard from Oprah, America’s new favorite high school football coach, Tim Walz, and the party’s rising stars, like Govs. Wes Moore and Josh Shapiro. But with Nov. 5 just 74 days away, there is very little room for error. And if the convention and Harris’ acceptance speech are indications, Democrats know full well they cannot afford to make any mistakes between now and the election."
10,Highlights and analysis of Kamala Harris’ speech on the final day of the 2024 DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 21:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/kamala-harris-speech-dnc-live-updates-rcna165595,"This was a DNC that actually felt worth watching, one that put some of the rising luminaries to the forefront and jazzed up even some of the most cynical people I know. It’s something that would have been hard to imagine just a month ago, but the energy and momentum is there. Now that we’re finally past both conventions, it’s up to the Harris campaign to continue working to capture this lightning and channel all that energy into getting voters to the ballot box in November. Jacob Soboroff speaking on MSNBC moments ago: This felt like a convention about neighbors, friends and family, whereas — and this is no secret, I’ve said it many times before — the Republican Convention was straight-up deeply disturbing.  There was one moment at that convention that made that crystal clear and that was thousands of people holding up signs that said ""mass deportations now."" The Republican Party’s platform literally consists of removing over 10 million people from the United States of America, many of whom are our neighbors, our friends and our families.  Both conventions talked about neighbors, friends and family. The Republicans said we want to remove millions of them from this country in a deportation effort with a magnitude bigger than the 1954 operation run by Dwight D. Eisenhower, with the name so racist and so offensive I don’t think it’s appropriate to say on television. The Republicans were proud of that. At the end of that convention, I remember standing in front of the stage with balloons bouncing off my head and it just felt bizarre, like we were in a bizarro world where they were having a party while we talked about kicking out people who are the fabric of the United States of America.  Here you looked at the stage and that looked like a family. That’s the fabric of the United States of America. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: This was joyful. It was full of love. People watching were like, where has that amazing person been for the last couple of years? That's a lot of what I’m getting in text messages from right now. But it's also the biggest moment to remind the American public that this is ultimately still an election where Kamala Harris is running against Donald Trump.  That’s part of why there's this big coalition of current Republicans, former Republicans, sheriffs, people who don’t normally come to these things because this election is not the norm. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. One line that stands out in re-reading the speech captures a key difference between Harris’ vision of America and Trump’s. Telling the story of how her single mother relied on neighbors and friends to help raise her and her sister, Harris said these aunts and uncles were “none of them, family by blood, and all of them, family by love.” Trump has also referenced “blood,” notably saying in December that undocumented immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” a line that uncomfortably echoed the “blood and soil” rhetoric of white supremacists. Harris has also represented her vision through her own family, which includes two stepchildren, and her calls for the protection of the rights of of LGBTQ families. Symone Sanders-Townsend speaking on MSNBC moments ago: For this current Republican party apparatus, the culture wars are not just a distraction: they are the playbook. Donald Trump and JD Vance would love nothing more than for Vice President Harris to stand on that stage and say, elect me because you will make history.  She’s not saying that. She’s saying elect me for all of these other reasons. Elect me because I’m decent, because I’ll fight for you, because I know what needs to be done and because I respect America. She’s essentially saying, elect me because I am a patriot and the other guy is not. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Ari Melber speaking on MSNBC moments ago: For years, we’ve known her as the vice president but tonight, America got to meet Harris for the role she’s played most of her career: representing the people.  It was a home run of a speech. What we heard was her give the opening statement: here’s who I am, here’s where I come from and these are my values. Then she made the case against Donald Trump and she made it more directly and more bluntly than we’ve heard throughout this inclusive and joyous convention. She needed to do that because that’s what candidates do.  So for all the joy, she hit him hard legally — she spoke about Jan. 6, democracy and fraud. She also made a point to say something that’s legally true, that Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse. That is something that fewer people have said from the main stage — that, again, is the Kamala Harris we know from being the tough prosecutor. Then third, we got the closing argument, broadening back out to the message: we can do this together, I'm proud to be American, we’re not going back. In each of those chapters, we got what you would get from her in the courtroom — and she’s good at it. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Harris demonstrated some elite storytelling ability tonight. It felt like the nation was becoming more acquainted with her as she told stories of her parents’ background and her upbringing. And when it comes to the sheer politics, she showed she’s very skilled at weaving her personal background into discussions about voter issues. Whether she was discussing her mom’s experience as a health professional, how her parents’ reverence for the civil rights movement prepped her for a legal career, or the pride her family and their neighbors had in homeownership, she told a relatable story about the positive role that the government has played in her family and the good things it can do for others. It’s a markedly different approach than Trump and the GOP are taking — and with much better delivery, too. Harris has gotten a lot better at giving speeches. As a former prosecutor, she was always good when cross-examining a witness in a Senate hearing, but her big set-piece speeches weren’t as good. Whether it’s practice from her time as vice president or having better speechwriters, she did a solid job at the podium tonight. The one thing that stuck out to me was the dissonance between the joyousness at the convention and the Democratic Party’s treatment of its pro-Palestinian factions. Party leaders snubbed the Uncommitted movement and the delegates who spoke up about their demand for an arms embargo against Israel were booted from the floor. How the party dealt with their own this week spoke volumes, and it certainly won’t go unnoticed among undecided voters for whom Gaza is a major issue. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Just to draw a contrast, tonight, what was Donald Trump doing? He was posting on media things like “where’s Hunter?” and “no, Tim Walz wasn’t coach, he was assistant coach.” And that’s funny, but it’s also not. It’s actually pretty devastating. So people will of course ask, was Harris' speech perfect? But look at what she’s running against. It's darkness and fear vs. optimism and light. And that’s what she offered tonight, not just optimism and light but real policy and a vision for the country. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We’ve talked a lot over the course last couple of days about how Democrats are trying to reclaim patriotism. I feel like it culminated in this night.  There are these gigantic flags. There’s The Chicks singing the Star Spangled Banner.  There’s the thesis that came into full flower tonight with Kamala Harris making the argument that the true strength, the true integrity, the true patriotism, lies in the Democratic Party. They have opened the flaps of the tent to encompass Republicans, to encompass doubters, to encompass people who felt culturally divorced from the party for decades and here we have one of the broadest, deepest, most diverse coalitions I have ever seen. All of them marching under the stars and stripes. It’s really something else. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Women were so present in this convention, in a way they were absent in the Republican National Convention because they were trying to avoid the whole abortion conversation.  But it isn’t just on reproductive rights, it was the idea of mom, of mommy, of motherliness that's been woven throughout this convention. Whether it was Michelle Obama talking about losing her mom or the many women talking about having the choice on how to create families. The way they’ve described family and mothers has been very unique and interesting. As well as the way they’ve defined manhood and masculinity. I still can’t get over Tim Walz's son, I think that is still sticking with so many people. It’s a really modern sort of conception of the family.  Between that moment and this night of hearing Kamala Harris and her sister Maya talk about their mom, I definitely feel like this was an embrace of motherhood by choice, whether it's a stepmom or a blended family. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump ran a one-man live blog tonight, firing off more than 40 posts (yes, I counted) on Truth Social, starting from the moment she walked onstage. He criticized her on immigration, on reproductive rights — “I TRUST WOMEN, ALSO, AND I WILL KEEP WOMEN SAFE!“ — on the economy, and much more. “IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” he asked at one point. Well, yes. After the balloon drop, the convention ended with a benediction from two speakers who hit on the Harris campaign theme of freedom. Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt of Washington D.C.’s Adas Israel Congregation, began with a reference to the book of Exodus, saying “God brought us out of the narrow place of oppression to freedom.” Lawrence O'Donnell speaking on MSNBC moments ago: My experience listening to Kamala Harris began when tonight’s host of the convention, Kerry Washington, asked me “Would you like to meet the female Obama?” This was in 2009, in the first months of the Obama presidency. And so we went along with Reggie Hudlin, who coincidentally produced some of the films in this convention, to listen to the San Francisco district attorney. And it’s one of those moments that’s clearly once in a lifetime. I was sitting there realizing I am seeing the first Black woman president, no question about it. ""Star power"" is a Hollywood phrase, but it’s a real thing. Every once in a while there is someone who yes, has all the resume stuff, but then there’s this other thing. And it’s that star power. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Harris’ speech wrapped up after about 40 minutes, less than half the amount of time it took Trump to deliver his speech, which lasted more than 92 minutes and made for the longest convention acceptance speech in history. It may seem trivial, but I continue to believe that this difference between Trump — who has been known to deliver some exhaustingly long speeches — and Harris speaks to a respect that the Democrat has for her audience that Republican seems to lack. She delivers speeches that are fairly short and to the point, as if she and her supporters have places to be. Trump drones on with speeches — sometimes for hours at a time — like he knows his fans have an endless amount of time to give him, or like nobody has anything else better to do. Nicolle Wallace speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I think there was some incorrect analysis out there that Harris somehow had to pass the commander-in-chief test. But what she did tonight was disqualify Donald Trump from ever being the country’s commander-in-chief. She said, “Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important election in our lives, it’s the most important in the life of our nation.” You take her speech and you take some of these lines from former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, who said that every president since World War II, Republican and Democrat, shared the belief that America must protect democracy in the world. Every president has honored our veterans and their sacrifices. Every president but one. You add Adam Kinzinger and Congressman Ruben Gallego and their indictments of Trump’s disrespect and disregard for members of the military, especially those who have been injured or died in service to the country, they were scathing. Those indictments were elevated on the biggest stage in American politics and I think they closed the door in the minds of anyone watching on Donald Trump ever passing the commander-in-chief test again. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Voters who had hoped that Harris would strike a different tone on Gaza likely came away disappointed tonight. The vice president said she and Biden are “working around the clock” for a hostage deal and a ceasefire. She affirmed her support for Israel’s right to defend itself and said she will always ensure its ability to do so. She condemned Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks and the “unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people” at the Nova music festival. But on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Harris adopted more passive language. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating,” she said, declining to specifically call out Israel’s role in the suffering and death. “So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again.”  This portion of this speech will also not placate the “Uncommitted” movement, which had slammed Harris and the DNC more broadly for failing to feature any Palestinian American speakers this week. Harris’ failure to draw a meaningful distinction between her and Biden’s view on the issue tonight will certainly be noted. As you may have noticed, there was not a special appearance from Mrs. Beyonce Knowles-Carter tonight. Dozens of attendees who wore “Cowboy Kamala” fits tonight for nothing are likely devastated at the lack of an appearance from the superstar. This despite TMZ promising us that she would be performing, as did several dozen random people on social media who insisted that she was there in Chicago. Look, I don’t know who started this rumor. Maybe it was a bored convention staffer whose deadpan is a little too dry to have their sarcasm register. Maybe it was James Taylor in revenge for having his number cut on Night 1 of the DNC. Maybe it was some evil genius on the Harris team who figured out a way to get people to tune in who might not otherwise watch and stay until the balloons have dropped.  In the end, we are all the more deceived for tonight’s ruse. But, if you really think about it, what is a recording of Beyonce’s “Freedom,” the campaign’s anthem that played at the close of Harris’ speech, if not a “performance?” Given her accelerated campaign launch, Harris has not released as many detailed proposals on what she would do as president as normal. She also has benefited both from Trump’s similarly thin agenda and the conservative Project 2025 proposal, which goes into excessive detail on a number of proposals that poll terribly. So I listened intently to her acceptance speech for hints of what she might do as president. Here are the specific promises: • Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act • Pass the Freedom to Vote Act • Pass the bipartisan border security bill that was scuttled earlier this year • Pass a middle-class tax cut that would help more than 100 million Americans • Work for a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza Others were more like broad goals than proposals, including lowering the cost of “everyday needs”; providing access to capital for small-business owners; building a strong middle class; ending the housing shortage; stopping cuts to Social Security and Medicare; ensuring that America leads in space and artificial intelligence; and creating an “earned pathway to citizenship” for undocumented immigrants. While everyone wonders how in the world this Beyoncé performance rumor took hold so deeply, why not read these fun balloon drop facts? “With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act,” Harris said. Well, that’s true but it’s going to take another Democratic trifecta in Washington next year to do it. Moreover, it’s going to take her fully supporting the Senate reforming (or, better yet, killing) the filibuster to do so. Harris and other Democrats have hit Trump hard the last few nights over his decision to kill a bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate negotiated. “Here is my pledge to you: As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed. And I will sign it into law,” Harris said. “We can create an earned pathway to citizenship —  and secure our border.” Yeah, I’m sorry but … the immigration bill is bad. Like, I get that there was, and is, a real desire to stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum across the border. But the bill that was negotiated focused entirely on the “border security” side of the equation and dropped the citizenship side entirely. In doing so, it didn’t just continue the failed immigration politics of the last 20 years, it made them worse. Harris just went on an extended riff on one of her favorite campaign themes: freedom. Borrowing a bit of rhetoric long used by Republicans (remember “freedom fries”?), Harris has sought to recast Democratic priorities as issues of freedom, including gun control, LGBTQ rights, climate change and voting rights. In her speech, she said: I’ve written more about her use of “freedom” — including the Beyoncé campaign song — here. Harris drew a distinct contrast between Democrats and Republicans — read: Trump — on reproductive rights. She also vowed to sign legislation to restore reproductive freedom at the federal level.   “Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom and now he brags about it,” she said. “And one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don’t trust women? Well, we trust women.” The entire week has built to this moment. We have heard from so many people who have known Harris throughout her life, and their words and anecdotes have contextualized and added depth and humanity to her profile. However, nothing is more important than the vice president telling her own story in her own words. This is the largest audience Harris may have this election, and it was critical to start tonight talking about her family, where she is from and what shaped her. She did that. But she did more than that. The VP’s story has pieces that everyone can identify with — moving around a lot as a child, watching her parents split up when she and her sister were young, growing up in a middle class community, living as the daughter of immigrants. Lots of people can literally see themselves in the journey of her life. When she accepted the nomination on behalf of all of those various communities and individuals, she elevated the conversation. The start of her speech made something big very clear: tonight is about all of America. Biden would often refuse to give Trump the dignity of using his name when referring to him in speeches. “The other guy” or “the former guy” littered his speeches. Harris on the other hand is leaning into calling out Trump directly. She also called out the threat he would entail should he return to power, without taking the dark tone that her boss has used when making similar warnings. I loved that line Harris delivered connecting her parents’ reverence for civil rights figures with her choice to become a lawyer. ""My parents had met at a civil rights gathering, and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker-Motley — those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America.” Over on The ReidOut Blog, I’ve written over the past couple years about Donald Trump and the conservative movement’s attacks on Black lawyers — like Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Harris is on that list as well. And her reference to the esteemed Black lawyers who came before her is a reminder of the conservative movement’s assault on Black civic and civil participation.  It’s been nearly a decade since Trump rode his golden escalator into American political life, and Harris is betting that people are ready to move on. Even though she’s served in the current administration for the last four years, the first thing that Harris said after accepting the nomination was that she was ready to turn the page. “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward,” she said. “Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” That’s the kind of line that you give at the end of a two-term presidency from the opposing party, not from a sitting vice president. But Trump has never really left, and Harris thinks Americans are ready to be done with him. I wrote earlier tonight about how this DNC has been a celebration of being a Democrat. The convention then proceeded to give prime speaking slots to a Republican, a cop and former military officials who could tout Harris as the next commander-in-chief. I saw plenty of complaints about this online, but it does make sense to me when you consider who the audience has been over the course of the last week. It’s been the diehard nerds like me and you fine folks reading this live blog who’ve been watching since the first night. Contrast that with the people who are less tuned in, likely more moderate, and are considering whether to vote for Harris and only taking a look tonight. If the idea is to invite those who are still considering voting for Trump, or might stay home if Harris is too liberal for them, to back Harris, then I get why they wanted to load up tonight with the most moderate to conservative elements backing her. Do I agree with this strategy? It’s hard to say. I get the logic, but I think there’s something to be said for pushing hard on the ways that Democrats are the party that will help them out the most on the night that the most eyeballs are watching live. This race is going to come down to turnout, getting people to show up to the polls or fill out their mail ballots. Trump has given up on that concept in favor of warning about nonexistent mass electoral fraud. Democrats are banking on convincing some of those who consider themselves independents, who are honestly more likely conservative, who are disillusioned with Trump to come out and support Harris instead. I’d prefer, though, if that didn’t come with frustrating those who spent the last several nights feeling a sense of pride in being a Democrat that had been lacking not just a few months ago, but over the last few decades. The bio section of the speech more than checked the box. It was a skillful effort of telling her own individual story while also making it about others and allowing people to connect with her personally. Harris stood in front of thousands and thousands of Democrats and delivered the lines they had all been waiting for this week: “On behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be President of The United States of America.” Harris told the story of her friend Wanda Kagan, who confided in Harris that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather in high school. “And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us. And she did,” Harris said. “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor — to protect people like Wanda.” A Montreal native, Kagan met Harris when the vice president lived in Canada during her teenage years. Kagan told Fox 5 recently about how Harris and her mother helped her when she was going through an abusive situation at home. The two lost touch after high school, but Kagan said she reached out after seeing Harris on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" years later, and they “picked up like time stood still.” “I know she impacted my life, that I may not be where I am today had it not been for her intervention back then, but to hear that I impacted her life too, was really, really special,” Kagan added. Harris began her speech by taking the torch from Biden, who did, in the end, pass it, but not without some drama along the way. “To our president, Joe Biden, when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude,” she said. “Your record is extraordinary as history will show, and your character is inspiring and Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both.” The shoutout only highlighted the fact that Biden, who spoke on Monday, was not at the convention Thursday. Earlier in the evening, Biden tweeted a photo of him and Jill watching the convention on TV. Harris walked out on stage to loud cheers that went on for what felt like a while — so much so that after several minutes and multiple “thank yous,” Harris tried to quiet the applause by saying: “Let’s get to business.” Harris thanked her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, at the top of her speech. It's a special day not only because she's making history as the first Black woman and first Asian American to be nominated for president but also because it's her 10th wedding anniversary. She wished a teary ""Dougie"" a happy anniversary and he blew her a kiss back as his daughter, Ella, pat his shoulder. It is prime time on the final night of the DNC and one of the main speakers is … a Republican. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., has stood alongside Democrats against Trump since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and served as one of two Republicans on the House committee investigating the attack. He spent his speech calling out his own party for abandoning conservatism in favor of Trumpism. And he invited fellow Republicans to vote for Harris for the values that they share with her over those they don’t with Trump: Adam Kinzinger’s speech tonight was just another reminder that, unlike the Republican convention in Milwaukee, this convention is about reaching out to a broader base of people in the country. It was about speaking to all people and not just one narrow wing of one party. And a consistent theme of reclaiming freedom.  As Kinzinger said, “The Democrats are as patriotic as us. They love this country just as much as we do.” The convention has been full of Republican speakers, sheriffs, former Republicans and people who still identify as Republicans. It's about inviting people to be a part of a movement and including them, which is not just the right feel-good thing to do, it's a smart political strategy. Actor and Democratic National Convention stalwart Eva Longoria used English, Spanish and Spanglish to tout Harris in her speech tonight. As with other convention speakers who know Spanish, Longoria threw in some Spanish as she was speaking, noting at one point that Americans are one big family, adding “somos familia” afterward. But then she went further and used Spanglish, that cringey American amalgam of both languages familiar from high-school Spanish classes, chain Mexican restaurant advertisements and awkward conversations. “In the Latino community, in our community, we have a saying ‘si se puede,’ which means ‘yes, we can,’” she said, citing the Obama-era slogan. “But tonight, I’m hear to tell you, ‘Yes, she can,’ so we’re going to say ‘she, se puede.’” That was a pretty powerful moment from Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Marine veteran, who capped off a series of Arizona-based speakers with a speech focused on the valor of military service and the importance of providing aid for veterans.  Gallego invited veterans onstage who have gone into politics — people he said come from city halls and state capitols, as well as the U.S House and Senate. Democrats like Rep. Ted Lieu of California, Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Illinois and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona all joined Gallego as he denounced Trump for disrespecting veterans. I have been to a lot of conventions, including the 2008 Obama convention in Denver (and that one was pretty great). But this one feels the most joyful, the most authentic, and the most connected to the big, diverse country we all live in. Part of it is removing some of the formality, bringing in more fun, changing up the programming, and making sure there are surprises. “Big Gretch” was the jolt that this night needed after a few low energy segments. The Michigan governor was charming, effusive, and hit Trump hard again and again in her speech. When it became clear that Biden might actually have to drop out of the race earlier this summer, Whitmer’s name was one of those floated to replace him as the nominee. She ultimately declined to challenge Harris once he stepped aside. But if this speech is any indication, Whitmer is going to be a strong potential contender eight years from now. Leon Panetta is a guy who has done pretty much every job in Washington. He took the stage to bolster Harris’ foreign policy cred as a former Defense secretary and CIA director. (He was also a congressman from California and chief of staff to Bill Clinton.)  Harris “understands what our military is for. The role of our military is to defend us from foreign enemies. It is not to threaten Americans, and as sure as hell, isn’t to put immigrants in camps.” This is in reference to Trump’s plans to use the military on American soil to conduct his promised “largest deportation program in history” and break up peaceful protests. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia took the stage alongside shooting survivors and victims’ family members as each of them spoke about how gun violence has affected them: Abbey Clements, a teacher who survived the Sandy Hook shooting; Kimberly Mata-Rubio, a mother whose daughter was killed in the Uvalde school shooting; Melody McFadden, who as a child witnessed her mother’s fatal shooting by an abusive partner and whose niece was killed by a stray bullet on Myrtle Beach in 2014; and Edgar Vilchez, a college sophomore who saw his classmate get killed in a drive-by shooting in 2022.  Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, a gun control activist, also gave a spirited speech. Giffords resigned from Congress in 2012 after being shot in the head during a mass shooting and assassination attempt. “I learned to walk again one step at a time. I learned to talk again one word at a time,” she said. “My friend Kamala will be a great president. She is tough. She has grit,” Giffords added. “Kamala can beat the gun lobby. She can fight gun trafficking.” Democrats wondering whether Harris made the right choice in her running mate had a good chance to check out one of the top contenders on Thursday. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly was the Washington insiders’ pick for most likely running mate due to his compelling personal biography and status as a swing-state senator. But his speech Thursday was workmanlike at best. He had a nice line about having to follow his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and singer Pink, but he didn’t sell it particularly well. The rest of the speech wasn’t particularly exciting. He spoke about the importance of teamwork and cited his experience as a U.S. Navy combat pilot and an astronaut.  If anyone was wondering if Harris should have picked Kelly instead, he didn’t give them any new reason in this speech. Mark Kelly shows why he wasn’t chosen to be the vice president nominee. He has honorably served the country, but he lacks any of the charisma or wow factor that is necessary in politics today. His dry performance tonight, in contrast to the raucous Walz speech last night, really makes you appreciate how big a whiff that would have been. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who took himself out of the search for a running mate, also gave a workmanlike speech that didn’t change anyone’s mind about Harris’ ultimate pick. Alecia Beth Hart Moore, better known as the modern icon Pink (or, P!nk), has been recording bangers for the last quarter decade. Yes, that is not a typo. But Pink’s longevity is only one part of her impressive legacy. More than the tens of millions of albums sold and world tours completed, it’s Pink’s pioneering brand of popp-y, punk-y empowerment that has always made her stand out. Years before it was common, or cool, Pink was penning anthems that reassured young women and girls everywhere that they mattered; that they were enough.  She pushed back, hard, on unrealistic beauty standards, George W. Bush and misogyny. She refused to apologize for her sexuality, her politics, her hair or her attitude. She spawned a generation of fans — myself included — who revered her authenticity, her passion and her talent. And that’s to say nothing of her live performances. Find me another pop star in her 30s who performs a Cirque du Soleil show while belting. I’ll wait. Tonight, she performed her rallying cry single “What About Us” with her daughter Willow Sage. And it was pretty “f----- perfect.” I’ll admit, even though my family still lives in Flint, Michigan, I hadn’t heard about Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson until tonight. He recounted the time in 2020 when, at the height of the George Floyd protests, he had his officers put down their riot gear to march with protesters in Flint Township. (Flint Township, I’ll note for accuracy’s sake, is a suburb of Flint itself.) It’s good to see that Swanson has kept that same energy four years later, as he compared that act with Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. He further added that Harris “has served America by keeping us safer, and I can testify firsthand that where I come from, crime is down.” Those are the kind of stats that Trump didn’t bother mentioning when he was in Michigan earlier this week, an hour away in Howell, to lie about crime. Comedian D.L. Hughley just took the stage and torched Trump as only a comedian could. The key headline from Hughley’s speech was his apology for having previously spread falsehoods about Harris’s prosecutorial record. But first he made sure to get a few shots in.  “If [Trump] keeps sliding in the polls the way he is, the only way he can keep Kamala out of the White House is if he buys it and refuses to rent it to her,” Hughley said, referencing Trump’s history with discriminatory housing accuations. Hughley also got in a dig about the “Republicans for Kamala” group. “I guess Donald Trump will finally know what it’s like when you get left for a younger woman,” he said. Earlier this week, I wrote about how Democrats made the second night of the DNC feel like “Def Comedy Jam” with all of the biting Trump jokes. In Hughley, Dems platformed an actual star from the hit series. The president is rooting Harris on from 2,000 miles away in California. Harris’ niece Meena Harris took the stage along with the vice president’s stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, and her goddaughter Helena Hudlin. Emhoff (whose dress, by the way, was phenomenal) said that when Harris came into her life at the age of 14, “she was patient, caring and always took me seriously.” Hudlin told the crowd that Harris’ “advice means everything, whether it’s pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn’t feel so hopeful.” It was a major contrast with the character witnesses that Trump brought to the stage last month at the RNC, that’s for sure. Unlike then, none of the speakers tonight are Harris’ employees. In what may be one of the cuter moments ever staged at a political convention, Harris’ great-nieces Amara and Leela Ajagu joined actress Kerry Washington on stage to teach the audience “how to say our auntie’s’ name.” “First you say ‘comma’ like a comma in a sentence,” said Amara.  “Then you say ‘la,’ like la-la-la-la-la,” added Leela. The girls then led the crowd in saying “comma” and “la.” The moment was cute, but there was a serious subtext. Trump and GOP allies such as Rep. Nancy Mace have repeatedly mispronounced Harris’ first name. While possibly understandable a few years ago, this sign of disrespect is pretty obviously intentional today. Country trio The Chicks just took the stage to sing the national anthem. The country music industry has been in the spotlight throughout the week, with performances from Mickey Guyton and Maren Morris, as well. I can’t help but think of The Chicks invitation as a bit of a thumb in Republicans’ eyes. After all, The Chicks are true victims of the “cancel culture” conservative types often complain about. The group faced backlash and was effectively blackballed by many in the country music industry in 2003 after they publicly denounced George Bush for launching the Iraq War. Democrats have been having a hell of a party this week. A big question that one important group watching Harris tonight wants to know is whether they can feel welcome joining the fun. There is a bloc of voters that lean right but can’t get down with Donald Trump, and they will be looking for some assurance that Harris is running to represent all Americans, not just the progressive left. No one is expecting her to promote conservative ideas, but a speech that speaks to the mainstream, projects a strong America on the world stage, and promises basic competence in governance could go a long way to broaden her coalition. Newly minted Olympic gold medalist Steph Curry just made an appearance to endorse Harris via video. Curry said his experience winning gold with the USA men’s basketball team in France helped inspire him to back Harris.  “That unity on and off the court reminded us all that together we can do all things and continue to inspire the world,"" Curry said. ""That’s why I believe that Kamala as president could bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward. This is about preserving hope and belief in our country, and making sure families can be taken care of during their most precious times.” Curry’s coach Steve Kerr endorsed Harris on the first night of the DNC and performed Curry’s “night night” three-point celebration to mock Trump. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: It’s important to remember to step back. A month ago, Harris was writing an entirely different speech. Normally, you work on these speeches for months. You have polling, you have focus groups, and you have meetings with senior advisors. This is a shorter runway. This is also about tomorrow. It’s not just about tonight. What she needs to do is not a policy speech but an inspiring speech — a vision. Tonight, she needs to ask people to go out there and get active. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. We just finished a stretch of speakers focused on climate change and Democrats’ efforts to mitigate its effects. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland struck out at Trump’s claim that climate change is a hoax and how he “made it easier for big companies to poison our air and water.” Content creator John Russell took the stage after a video he produced highlighted Trump’s faux support for labor and the clean energy jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act. And Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., the first Gen Z member of Congress, reminded the crowd that “the climate crisis isn’t some far-off threat — it is here.” What a difference this is from DNCs past. “Climate was not a campaign issue eight or 12 years ago,” Manish Bapna, president of the NRDC Action Fund, told NPR ahead of the convention. “It was extremely difficult to get climate into one of the major debates, it was seen as a peripheral and not a central issue.” Fast-forward to today, and it’s a crucial part of the case that Democrats are making for Harris. Frost, who was an organizer before being elected as the first Gen Z member of Congress, delivered a short, punchy speech focused on the chief concern among younger generations. “Fighting the climate crisis is patriotic. And unlike Donald Trump, our patriotism is more than some slogan on a hat. It’s about actually giving a damn about the people who live in this country,” Frost said. “Because when you love someone, you want them to have clean air. When you love someone, you want them to have safe drinking water. And when you love someone, you want them to have a dignified job.” There’s been a parade of prosecutors, current and former, onstage tonight to speak to Harris’ background. That includes Amy Resner, who worked alongside Harris in California early in her career, and Tristan Snell, who prosecuted the case against Trump University. “I can’t wait to see her prosecute the case against Donald Trump on the debate stage in September,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a fellow former state attorney general, told the crowd. “We face a stark choice in this election, a felon and con man, or a dedicated prosecutor.” The moment highlighting Harris’s prosecutorial accomplishments featured Nathan Horns, a student victimized by Corinthian Schools’ predatory lending practices and false assurances to students. As attorney general, Harris filed a lawsuit that ultimately helped secure billions of dollars in student loan forgiveness for students who borrowed to attend Corinthian. Naturally, this provided an opening to discuss Trump’s infamous, multimillion-dollar settlement with defrauded students enrolled in the now-defunct Trump University.  Tristan Snell, a lawyer who prosecuted Trump University before the settlement, said, “Donald Trump ripped off his biggest fans and made $5 million in profit.” He adds, “Kamala Harris fought scammers like him” and will fight for the people as president. Trump’s rally in Arizona tomorrow will include a special guest, his campaign says. The rally will take place just hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running in the presidential race as an independent candidate, holds a news conference in Phoenix (a 30-minute drive from Glendale), during which he is reportedly expected to announce an end to his presidential bid and endorse Trump. New York City Councilman Yusuf Salaam, one of the exonerated “Central Park Five,” said it plainly: “He wanted us dead.”  The brutal rape and attempted murder of a female jogger in Central Park in the spring of 1989 represented the apotheosis of fears over crime in 1980s New York City. But before due process could run its course, a Manhattan real estate developer named Donald Trump infamously paid for a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of the teenagers accused of the crime. The teens were convicted and served prison time, but they were exonerated. They didn’t do it. And Trump has never acknowledged his error. In fact, he’s expressed support for extrajudicial killings in other countries as a crime-preventive measure.  Watching Salaam and his fellow exonerees speak to the nation three-and-a-half decades removed from their wrongful arrests and convictions is a striking moment — and also a prescient warning of what Trump would do on his retribution tour if we were to win another term. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Daily today, Walz's speech delivered a ""communal patriotism"" that was in ""striking contrast"" to Donald Trump. But it the vice presidential nominee's personal story about his family infertility struggles — and his children's reaction to it — that stole the show. ""You are my entire world and I love you,"" Walz said to his daughter, Hope, and his son, Gus. Hope made a heart symbol with her hands as her brother stood up beside her, teared up and shouted, ""That's my dad!"" The Rev. Al Sharpton leaned into his background at the pulpit with his speech, riffing hard on Harris’ unofficial campaign slogan “We won’t go back” to get the crowd on their feet. And he brought it home hard while paraphrasing the Bible: Rachel Maddow speaking on MSNBC moments ago: As Kamala Harris gets ready to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president of the United States, it has been 152 years since Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to ever run for president in this country — long before women even had the right to vote. It has been 52 years since Shirley Chisholm became the first Black candidate for president. It has been eight years since Hillary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.  Tonight, Kamala Harris will accept the nomination of her party as the culminating event of what has been a supercharged, energetic, profoundly enthusiastic convention. Television ratings, to the extent that they matter in the world, so far show the Democrats have pretty widely outpaced the Republican convention in terms of how many Americans have been watching this thing each night thus far. But it’s really only the beginning. Tonight’s finale from the Democratic Convention in Chicago will start a 75-day sprint to election night. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Taking back the idea of “patriotism” from Republicans has been a major theme this week, and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., was a great choice to continue that trend. Slotkin, who is running for the U.S. Senate, denounced Trump’s desire to withdraw from the world, and she told listeners to “proudly claim your patriotism. You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag but spit in the face of freedom. It represents you.” Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I can just tell you that when Senator Warren was announced and started to walk on that stage, this entire arena erupted. That sustained applause was on a similar level to the way that Tim Walz was received. It was on a similar level to the way Bill Clinton was received. It was loud, it was sustained and you could see her get emotional.  I think it’s poignant because it really speaks to where the Democratic Party has moved. This is a party that is unashamed of being progressive and unashamed of its progressive values.  Warren used to be a Republican back in the day. She then shifted and became a Democrat. She's sort of defined and maligned on the right as some socialist but she’s not. She’s just an academic who became a politician to try to stop rich people and corporations from cheating people. That’s a basic value. It's now a mainstream Democratic Party progressive value. I think that’s why she’s feeling that love. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Near the end of her speech, Sen. Elizabeth Warren cracked that she wouldn’t trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to move her couch. Get it? Of course you do. The ubiquitous joke built on an obviously fake premise drove Republicans batty for weeks. It was effective at highlighting their hypocrisy of abiding by nine years of defamatory falsehoods by Trump.  But it’s over. The joke is beat. Remember when the first ""Borat"" movie came out and it was the funniest thing in years and everyone was doing Sacha Baron Cohen’s ridiculous accent? Remember how annoying it was six months later?  That’s where the couch joke is now. And if Warren’s crack wasn’t contrived enough, the next speaker, Rep. Jason Crow, took another jab with a reference to a “couch commando.” Dems, it’s over. There’s comedy to be mined out there. Find another joke. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey echoed Harris’ attacks on price gouging, arguing that Americans are being “ripped off” by big corporations. He started by citing the price of diapers, which has skyrocketed recently. This increase isn’t due to inflation, Casey argued. “The corporations say your prices are up only because their costs are up,” he said. “They’re selling you a lie.” As with Harris, Casey said that while most companies are playing by the rules, diaper prices were up because of “food conglomerates” who are “extorting” consumers, comparing them to people who hoarded toilet paper during the pandemic. The Biden administration has struggled to find a response to inflation, but Harris took a new line on the issue earlier this month when she began talking about targeting price-gouging. Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado took the baton from ""SNL"" cast member Kenan Thompson to lead tonight’s Project 2025 takedown. As I mentioned earlier, quick, plain-spoken and easily digestible segments like these speak to Democrats’ focus on social media-friendly content at this year’s convention — content that can be shared long after the DNC ends. A standing ovation for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as she takes the podium. The crowd cheered for so long that the senator began to tear up, and tried to get the crowd to settle down. It’s worth remembering how popular she was among the base during her own run for president in 2020. Warren’s speech was heavy on boosting Harris’ support over how she has taken on corporations and big banks in favor of the little guy in America. It was the core of Warren’s own message when running for president in 2020, one that has since then become a centerpiece of Democratic messaging writ large. These days it’s hard to imagine a Democrat who would stand in front of a crowd this big and try to defend price gouging from corporations or billionaires who don’t pay their fair share in taxes. Harris will officially accept the Democratic nomination tonight, but she also celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary with second gentleman Doug Emhoff today. They both posted tributes to each other on social media, with Harris calling Emhoff “the best partner I could ask for.” The convention voted earlier this week to approve the official Democratic platform. Funnily enough, the text itself was approved by the committee that drafted it before Biden dropped out, leaving references to his re-election scattered throughout. Harris’ name is mentioned only as a part of the Biden-Harris administration and when talking about some of the initiatives she has spearheaded as vice president. As such, it stands to reason that there may be parts of the platform that she doesn’t fully agree with. For example, we don’t know if she is OK that this year’s plank deleted any reference to abolishing the death penalty. We also don’t know whether any of her own policy proposals might contradict those within the platform. It’s not binding on anyone running — but it would be nice to get some clarity about what she might do that would be different from a second Biden term. I, for one, would not have guessed ahead of this week that the DNC would have its own in-house hypeman: DJ Metro, on the ones and twos. He’s been pumping out jams since the convention gaveled in tonight and the people in the audience are loving it. So do the camera operators who have been loving snagging footage of the attendees dancing. I’m not trying to harsh anyone’s buzz, but I can’t help but think it’s going to be very funny to look back on these moments 30 years from now. As evidence, I submit to you this video from the 1996 DNC of attendees dancing to “The Macarena” without any further comment: After Republicans invited folks like Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock to give their convention a celebrity presence, Democrats raised the bar with a convention featuring celebs like Oprah, John Legend and Mindy Kaling. But some of the star power has had more of an impact behind the scenes. The biopic that is set to play before Harris’ speech tonight was directed by Reginald Hudlin, the famed director and producer behind classic films like “Boomerang” and “House Party.” Some more recent Hudlin films that have garnered critical acclaim include “Marshall,” which starred Chadwick Boseman, and “The Black Godfather,” a star-studded Netflix documentary about music executive Clarence Avant. Hudlin met Harris years ago through his wife, Chrisette, and the Hudlins’ son Alexander is the VP’s godson. Alexander spoke alongside Harris’ niece and nephew at the DNC last night. Jacob Soboroff speaking on MSNBC moments ago: The RNC kicked off in the wake of the horrific assassination attempt of Trump. And there was a lot of conversation about how it was going to feature a unifying message — which turned out to be anything but. Instead there was a deeply divisive message, obviously. And remember what was happening on those convention signs? They said “mass deportation now.” It was literally a message of kicking millions of people out of the country, many of whom, especially from a place like California, are our neighbors, are our colleagues, and people we know very well. Obviously that’s not the tone or the tenor of the DNC at all. And it’s so easy to feel the difference standing down on the floor. Those folks at the Republican convention, they were enthusiastic, and they were happy to be there. But this is an entirely different thing.  These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Affordable housing is deeply lacking across the country, a crisis that the federal government has only just begun to address. It makes sense then that several of the early speakers tonight have chosen to focus on it. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge told the audience that Harris “knows housing is a human right and a pathway to the middle class.” Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., told the audience about her work as California attorney general to deal with predatory loans during the Great Recession and her dedication to affordable housing. Accordingly, one of the first policy proposals that Harris has put forward since ascending to the top of the ticket is to provide $25,000 in aid to first-time homebuyers for a down payment. Interestingly enough, neither Fudge nor Lieu directly mentioned Harris’ proposal in their speeches. Sen. Alex Padilla, who succeeded Harris as a U.S. senator from California when she became vice president, noted in his brief remarks that she’s good with his kids. “Whenever she sees Roman, Alejandro and Diego, she greets them with kindness and respect,” he said. “Literally meeting them on their level to speak to them and to listen.” Padilla’s remarks serve as a major contrast with Trump, who once flubbed a simple Christmas Eve call with a 7-year-old. Rep. Ted Lieu of California kicked off his speech with a jab at Trump for his ridiculous claim that the Harris campaign was using artificial intelligence to fabricate crowds in photos.  “As a computer science major, I am so impressed with how large this AI-generated crowd looks tonight,"" Lieu said. Lieu has never missed an opportunity to make a mockery of Trump. Michael Steele speaking on MSNBC moments ago: There are three pieces that will go into Harris’ speech tonight: the bio, the acknowledgment of the work she’s done with Joe Biden and then, of course, where she wants to go. What does President Harris look like and sound like? We should hopefully get a first taste of that this evening. There are a bunch of gnarly issues out there that are waiting for her that will have to be addressed almost immediately upon taking the oath of office. I think the American people would like to get some sense of what that feels like and looks like for them. It’s not just the economy, it’s global affairs, it’s reproductive health, it’s educating their children or it’s starting their small business.      I remember well from when I was in school that teachers are adept at tagging-teaming. So it was with Rebecca Pringle, head of the National Education Association, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Walz’s background as a former public school teacher has been featured heavily this week, so it seems fitting that Pringle leaned into it in her speech. She also took on the job of being the cheerleader for Coach Walz and Harris, while Weingarten hit harder at Trump and Vance in her speech Democrats have a well-deserved reputation for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. And yet they have been almost aggressively “in array” for the past month. There’s no secret sauce to reveal. A historically unpopular incumbent president — already facing slim odds at re-election — gave a debate performance so catastrophic it will make historians forget about Richard Nixon’s flop-sweat in 1960 and George H.W. Bush impatiently looking at his watch in 1992. But Joe Biden then dropped out of the race. His replacement, Kamala Harris, benefits from a surge of non-negativity left in the wake of his exit. After his retirement party on opening night, Biden has been an afterthought at this convention. But try to imagine tonight as the capper of a weeklong hype party to re-elect Biden. To get there, Biden would have withstood a seven-week-long rebellion by the leadership of his party, top donors and activist groups. He’d have to continue to insist the polls were wrong, that Donald Trump and the right’s relentless attacks on his cognitive decline weren’t leaving a mark on his approval ratings, and that his choice to stay in the race was actually a selfless act and destined to succeed. He’d have had to make the case to the American people that he’s the present and the future of the party. It’s hard to imagine Nancy Pelosi in the crowd chanting “We love Joe!” in that scenario, although she’d probably still have dutifully shown up. But that’s another universe entirely. Harris has been a top voice in the Biden administration in condemning the rising death toll in Gaza and the deep suffering of Palestinian civilians in the enclave. Since she launched her presidential bid in July, her campaign has also held meetings with the Uncommitted movement, which aims to push the party on a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. But whether or not she would make a significant policy shift on the issue if she’s elected is a big unknown. In her speech tonight, Harris may denounce the killings of civilians in Gaza — as she has in the past — which is an arguably safe position to take, politically speaking. But the vice president, who still has not released detailed policy plans so far and has been described as risk-averse, is unlikely to even subtly criticize Israel’s military conduct in Gaza. Never one to cede the spotlight, Trump attempted a little counterprogramming by visiting the U.S.-Mexico border today. Standing at a podium in Cochise County, Arizona, the former president read short but graphic descriptions of sexual assaults, robberies and murders committed by immigrants. “With your vote, we will seal the border, stop the invasion and launch the largest deportation effort in American history,” he said. The campaign stop was meant to highlight the issue of immigration, but Trump’s grim and graphic remarks also provided a stark contrast with the optimistic tone of the Democratic National Convention all week. On Friday, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, will hold a rally in Glendale outside Phoenix. Ari Melber, speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I’m reminded of the song Public Service Announcement by Jay-Z where he says, “Allow me to reintroduce myself.” That’s something that people do even when they’re well known. Tonight is Vice President Kamala Harris’ reintroduction on the grand stage. In that song, Jay-Z says, “My homie Strict told me, ‘Dude finish your breakfast’...Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this. Shoot at you actors like movie directors.” That’s not only a double entendre, he’s calling out his opponents, his foes as actors, as inauthentic, while he’s the real deal.  I’m looking for Harris to build on what Gov. Tim Walz did last night. She’s at the top of the ticket. I’m expecting her to speak on these actors, these phonies, these fakes. That’s not just Donald Trump but the part of the MAGA movement that has tried to steal and fake what they represent — “real America” or family values or football or freedom.  All three days have been leading up to this moment. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Following in the grand tradition of the Oscars and other televised events, this year’s DNC has consistently run behind schedule. But that may be a calculated risk.  While it’s true that running late pushes some of the big speeches out of prime time, that isn’t really the disaster that it might have been a few years ago. Most viewers who willingly tune into four nights of convention programming are probably already on board with the Harris campaign. With so many streaming platforms, cable TV channels, and video games out there to fill your night, less plugged-in voters are not forced to watch conventions anymore. But they’ll still run across them, when they turn to social media, where the highlight reels of the big speeches will be playing on repeat in the coming days. Democratic leaders have refused to grant a speaking slot to a Palestinian American on the main stage, the Uncommitted movement said Wednesday. Members of the movement, which hopes to pressure Harris on an arms embargo to Israel and on a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, have been holding a sit-in outside the United Center since Wednesday evening. The group’s leader, Abbas Alawieh, has said that Harris’ campaign made an offer of a private meeting instead, which the group rejected. Now, party leaders are now facing increasing pressure from uncommitted delegates, Democratic lawmakers and outside groups, such as United Auto Workers and the Sunrise Movement, to allow a Palestinian American to address the convention on its final night. Earlier today, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in an interview with Zeteo: “If we are to say that we’re a party that is inclusive, that unity is our strength, we have to make room. There’s still time.”   As Harris takes the stage for the biggest speech of her political career, she may be leaning on some old lessons for public speaking. As a senator in 2019, she shared some of that advice with a young woman. The moment, which was caught on tape, was then posted on Harris’ social media channels. “I never miss a chance to speak with our future leaders, especially young women,” Harris wrote on Facebook. “One recently asked me how to become a better public speaker. My answer: ‘Remember, people need to know what you know!’” In the video, Harris tells the girl to imagine that she’s the only person on the Titanic who knows that the ship is going to sink and needs to tell everyone. “If you are on the Titanic and you know the ship is about to sink, and you’re the only one who knows, are you going to worry about how you look and how you sound? No, because the thing that’s most important is that everyone knows what you know.” The Harris campaign has received a lot of praise for its social media strategy. I’ve been following along with this week’s DNC programming with that in mind, while picking out portions of the convention that have seem tailor-made for social media. When the campaign announced that it would offer an online stream of the event that could play in vertical format, as well as invite popular influencers to attend in person, it showed they were prioritizing viewers who might be watching the convention online and accustomed to getting their information there. And this week, various segments in-between speakers have been produced in a style or written in the same punchy tone as political content you’ve likely seen go viral. That includes the “two lies and a lie” segment that aired on Monday, the Vox-style explainer video narrated by Harris about Trump’s tariffs plan that aired Tuesday, and the brief Project 2025 interludes we’ve seen throughout the week — in particular, the one starring “SNL” cast member Kenan Thompson. It has all felt like Democratic Party officials recognize that the Harris campaign has developed a lot of momentum on social media — and want to keep feeding the audience they’ve established there with familiar content. Democrats, thrilled by Harris’ “joyful” campaign, have really leaned into “politics as entertainment” at the convention this week. In between warnings about the dire stakes in this election, they’ve had huge musical acts (with Pink and The Chicks scheduled to perform later, and a big mystery guest who some pundits have speculated is Beyoncé), DJ-led dance breaks and Hollywood celebrities as keynote speakers. Most attendees certainly seem to be enjoying themselves, but whether you perceive it as unbridled enthusiasm for Harris or as a garish political spectacle may depend on how you feel about American politics in general. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: There are two colors you see a lot in the audience. One is blue, unsurprisingly, but overwhelmingly, the color is white. And the symbolism is not lost on me and it’s not lost on a lot of people. This is a moment women in this country have been waiting a long time for, which is the elevation of a woman to the top of the Democratic Party and I would say there’s even more than maybe there was in 2016 or renewed optimism in the wake of Donald Trump years and the defeat that Hillary Clinton suffered. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. The DNC just released some additional speakers for tonight.  As someone who lived through the Clinton and Obama years, this DNC feels like a major shift has occurred. Gone is the almost apologetic tone that Democrats adopted in the aftermath of blowout losses in 1980, when “Reagan Democrats” voted for the Republican nominee, and the “shellacking” of the 2010 midterms. Instead, what we’ve seen in speech after speech is a party that knows what it stands for and what it stands against. Within the past 15 years, the Democrats have gone from a party with a sizable conservative wing (either fiscally like the Blue Dogs, socially on abortion and gay rights, or both) to one that loudly champions workers over corporate greed, protections for LGBTQ Americans, and abortion rights for all. There’s still a lot of room for improvement on a number of issues, but the difference between then and now shouldn’t be taken for granted. Social media and media pundits are abuzz with speculation about whether music icons Beyoncé and Taylor Swift — arguably THE biggest names in music right now — will appear tonight at the DNC to support Harris. Pop singer Pink and country trio The Chicks (formerly known as the Dixie Chicks) are already slated to perform tonight. But fans can't help but wonder if Queen Bey and T-Swift will also show up. With Beyoncé's permission, Harris is using her song ""Freedom"" as her campaign anthem. It's been featured heavily during the convention, on the campaign trail, and in a new campaign ad. Some speculated that White House political director Emmy Ruiz's tweet this afternoon hinted at a Beyoncé performance (she tweeted a bee emoji, a possible reference to ""Bey."" She also tweeted after that ""my 6 year old took my phone."" Hmm. To this Taylor Swift fan, it seems improbable that she would make an appearance tonight for a couple of reasons: 1.) When she endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, it wasn't until a few weeks before the election, and 2.) In an Instagram post yesterday, she said the foiled terror plot that canceled Eras Tour shows in Vienna filled her with ""a new sense of fear."" It wouldn't seem surprising if she wanted to avoid making any political statements in light of that. But hey, we'll just have to wait and see. It’s kind of weird: Listen to just about any high-profile Democrat talk about Trump and the GOP presidential ticket these days, and odds are it won’t be long before you hear the word “weird.” As Ja’han Jones recently noted for The ReidOut Blog, “weird” might be far too mild for the likes of Trump, but there’s little doubt that the descriptor has rattled him — the former president insisted at a campaign event Monday that he and his running mate, JD Vance, are “extremely normal people.”  Ja’han also explained that the rhetorical strategy has etymological roots in California slang: “In Harris’ home state of California, for example, “weird” — for many young nonwhite people — doesn’t just mean quirky or unique, it’s used as an insult. That’s why there’s a genre of TikToks featuring young Californians talking about how being called “weird” — or its variant, “a weirdo” — is an offense that basically amounts to fighting words.” Read Ja’han’s full piece below. Check out these highlight reels from the first three nights of the convention to get caught up. In many ways, Harris’ speech tonight will be more like a campaign launch than a typical acceptance speech. Because of the truncated way in which she kicked off her run this year, the vice president did not have a big kickoff rally to introduce her big themes and set the stage for the campaign. Instead, she visited the already-running Biden campaign headquarters and then jumped into routine campaigning, with one big policy speech on economics.  That makes tonight the moment for Harris to lay out her vision for the presidency, make the case for her policy agenda, which remains a work in progress, and tell her personal story. It probably won’t be too different from the kickoff speech she had for her ill-fated 2020 run for the Democratic presidential nomination, in which she talked about how her parents met and how she viewed the role of prosecutor as helping fight for fairness. Harris, of course, is the keynote speaker tonight. Don't expect her to address the convention before 11 p.m. ET. Here's who is expected to speak before Harris tonight (in no particular order):"
11,Why it matters that Kamala Harris has two white guys in her corner,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 13:09:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-white-guys-doug-emhoff-tim-walz-rcna166670,"“Historic,” the word most often used to describe Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential candidacy, is just shorthand for the fact that in nearly 250 years of this country’s existence, no one who looks like her has ever been at the top of a major party’s ticket.  That’s got nothing to do with ability. Racism and sexism are rigorous gatekeepers of America’s halls of power. Consequently, the mere presence of a biracial Black American woman of Indian descent in the race at this stage is a challenge to the status quo. But Harris’ run is also historic in another, less discussed way.  Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. On the campaign trail, Doug Emhoff and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Harris’ husband and vice presidential running mate, respectively — embody figures rarely before observed in American life: white men who know their place. That is to say, white men who know their supportive place and seem to occupy it without hesitation or resentment. This is the first time our national political stage has hosted two white men whose role is to passionately champion a Black woman all the way to the White House.  Obviously, it’s vitally important not to diminish Harris as the main character in this political story. But it’s still worth examining the optics presented by Walz and Emhoff, because those two white guys are defying and potentially redefining America’s vision of authority and leadership. Amid all the racist, sexist MAGA detritus that surrounds us, the Harris campaign is a necessary glimpse at what American power, equality and truly inclusive democracy could someday look like. That redefinition would be notable in any moment, but it’s particularly important in the dark timeline we find ourselves on. Former President Donald Trump’s frequent attacks on Black women journalists and insults toward Black women lawmakers have energized masses of racist misogynists. The corrosive spillage of MAGA identity politics — in addition to innumerable anti-woman and anti-anti-racist laws, policy proposals and civil rights rollbacks — has included the absurd notion that white masculinity is in crisis. Walz seems to have understood the assignment from the jump. During vetting interviews, Walz reportedly volunteered that he wasn’t “angling for anything else” and emphasized, “This is not about me.” Both quotes suggest Walz not only understood the level of deference and loyalty required, but also took pains to establish that he would have no issues offering both to a Black woman superior.  “Being strategically invisible or staying in the background will require a humility that many white men have never had to demonstrate,” Sheletta Brundidge, a Minnesota-based Black woman author, wrote in a Minnesota Star Tribune op-ed. “She’s going to be Gladys Knight; he will be a Pip.”  Since his selection, Walz has seemed joyful as second-in-command, radiating an ease in the role that most likely assuages the reflexive discomfort some voters — and particularly white voters — would feel seeing the boss is a Black woman.  The misogynist smears that might allow MAGA types to portray Walz as a “beta” for playing second banana to a Black woman are simply less effective because of his background as a football coach, hunter, gun owner and National Guard veteran. Misogynoir falsely pathologizes Black women as inherently anormal — but as an older, rural-coded Midwestern white man, Walz is regarded as almost aggressively normal — or as the headlines put it, “all-American” and an “everyman.”  The tendency to view Black women with suspicion and hostility — to interpret the mildest pleas for equitable change as inherently dangerous and threatening — remains. But the Harris campaign might succeed in moving the needle a bit on those perceptions.  The same reassurances are provided by Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman- turned-Harris campaign surrogate, whose demonstrations of supportive partnership earned his reputation as a “wife guy” as far back as 2019. Emhoff’s loving advocacy of his wife’s ascendance consistently suggests he feels he “married up” — a sentiment rarely extended to Black women in a system in which even their femininity is routinely questioned. (Right-wing memes questioning both Michelle Obama’s and Harris’ gender are par for the MAGA course.)  Emhoff ditched his career as a firm’s partner attorney to attend to his wife’s, breaking with all gender expectations, especially those attached to white men who have succeeded in corporate America. In positioning himself as the white man happily standing behind a great Black woman, Emhoff exemplifies a breed of white male masculinity in opposition to MAGA’s camp, women-hating, masculinity — one that emphasizes partnership and respect over insecure dominance and superiority. “I’m honored now to have my wife be at the top of the ticket,” Emhoff recently announced on a podcast. “I cannot tell you how proud I am of her.”  Emhoff’s words are a rejection of the idea that Black women’s goals should somehow be contained, that Black women are taking up too much space or vying for spots that somehow always rightfully belong to someone else. And it’s the opposite of the right’s fragile white masculinity model, which views gender equality as oppressive and racial justice as unbearable.  Several decades back, these folks would probably have called Emhoff and Walz “N-word lovers” and kept it moving, but now they use more euphemistic terms. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed Walz is “afraid of testosterone.” Rob Schmitt, a Newsmax anchor, described Walz as “the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people” — a gender and racial turncoat, if you will. Donald Trump Jr., the creative one in the family, predictably labeled the White Dudes for Harris fundraising call “Cucks for Kamala.” And Christopher Rufo, the right-wing architect of the phony “critical race theory” panic, was so apoplectic over the announcement of Walz’s appointment that he spent the whole day firing off social media copes. None of this is to suggest Walz and Emhoff should be lauded as American superheroes. White men are praised enough for doing the absolute barest of minimums on behalf of decency, and “white saviorism” is among our country’s most tired tropes. But the two are working against deeply ingrained, stubbornly persistent and highly damaging ideas about whiteness and maleness, modeling behavior that really shouldn’t be so expectation-defying at this point — and yet.  “How often in 100 days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in 100 days do you get to do something that’s going to impact generations to come?” Walz asked attendees on the White Dudes for Harris call. “And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his ass, sent him on the road?” It’s yet another idea that Harris herself couldn’t push too strongly, lest she set off alarm bells, handing MAGA something to scare white voters over. But the point stands, nonetheless."
12,Kamala Harris needs to start talking about policing — for Sonya Massey’s sake,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 12:12:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-policy-police-sonya-massey-dnc-rcna166753,"Much of the focus at the Democratic National Convention this week will be on how Vice President Kamala Harris, who will accept her party’s presidential nomination, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, address policy issues. The momentum Harris has generated since she reached the top of the ticket has been sensational but largely based on rhetoric that has provided a jolt of hopefulness to voters seeking an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. While Harris seems to understand the priorities of voters and has released her economic plan, one major policy area that she cannot afford to overlook is the future of civil rights. Last month, after an Illinois sheriff’s deputy shot and killed Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black mother of two who had called police for help, Harris reached out to Massey’s family to offer her condolences. The vice president’s public comments echoed the widespread and noncontroversial sentiment that Massey deserved to be safe. Still, at no point did Harris couple her statements about Massey’s being killed with any real plans to address future police violence in America. It is unclear whether, in this pivotal moment, 10 years after a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, Harris and the Democratic Party are committed not only to protecting existing civil rights but also to expanding them. For those who are concerned with addressing civil rights and police violence, and criminal justice in particular, Harris’ identity as a Black, Asian woman will not be enough. As her campaign begins to roll out more substantive policies around other issues, she must also lay out a concrete agenda around civil rights. Harris’ past as a prosecutor — she was the self-proclaimed “top cop” in California — has generated some skepticism about what policing and criminal justice might look like in a Harris administration. Some of her critics’ concerns are based on a distortion of her record, if not downright misinformation. However, even for the most objective of people, Kamala Harris’ history with regard to criminal justice reform and civil rights can be described as complicated. While she is a Democrat, her policies and practices as a prosecutor would not rank anywhere near the more progressive end compared with those of many of her counterparts across the country. It would not be inaccurate to label her a centrist, at best, who at times acted more as a populist. In communities of color especially, there’s a tenuous understanding of the role prosecutors play in relation to overall public safety and community. I say that as a former prosecutor myself. Though Black people want and deserve to live in safe communities, there are legitimate questions as to what role — if any — law enforcement should and can play in bringing about that safety. We learned during President Barack Obama’s two terms in the Oval Office that a Black president, even when paired with a Black attorney general, does not mean the police will stop abusing and killing Black people. Whether it is a vigilante private citizen, as in the cases of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, or violence stemming directly from police, as in the cases of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Atiana Jefferson and countless others whose ultimately went free, that a Black man was in office did not matter.  So many Black people experienced violence at the hands of law enforcement during Obama’s presidency and Eric Holder’s time as the first Black U.S. attorney general, but they were generally powerless in terms of their ability to hold those offending police officers accountable. The easiest and lowest-hanging fruit for Harris on the issue of police violence is to commit to the abolition of qualified immunity. This is the legal doctrine that shields law enforcement from accountability for wrongdoing. If Harris were to prioritize getting rid of qualified immunity as the bedrock of her civil rights agenda, it would immediately quell much of the apprehension around her candidacy from a civil rights perspective. Likewise, this is the time for her to lean in, not only with her words but also with substantive policy measures, to her experience as a prosecutor in addressing real criminal justice reform, as well as reform around policing. It would also distinguish her from Trump, who has called for “absolute immunity” for police. Civil rights, fundamentally, is about access and the opening of doors. The blowback against DEI is, for example, at its core steeped in anti-Blackness but rooted in a pendulum swing away from civil rights. There are a host of issue areas in which Harris could seek to have influence under the banner of civil rights. A commitment to closing the achievement gap for Black boys is a civil rights issue in that a denial of equal access to quality educational opportunities is a violation of their federally protected civil rights. Likewise, access to the ballot is a civil right, and it is instructive that Harris has been vocal in this vein. Presidents are not lawmakers, but Harris ought to commit to using the insuperable power of the bully pulpit to apply pressure and influence policy. This is why an omission of substantive talking points around civil rights is glaring and unacceptable. While Harris can and should take a broad approach in setting forth an ambitious civil rights policy agenda, it’s imperative that she keep the main thing as the main thing and squarely address the issues of criminal justice reform, abolishing qualified immunity and eliminating police violence in America through substantive policy reform. This week she will be on the biggest stage with the brightest lights and the loudest microphone. For the sake of Sonya Massey and so many others, Harris, with so many watching and listening, must present a plan."
13,I worked for Kamala Harris. Here’s the biggest difference between her and Trump.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 08:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-california-attorney-general-katie-porter-rcna167229,"What kind of president would Kamala Harris be? That’s a question many Americans are rightly asking themselves since the vice president became our presumptive Democratic nominee. As the only member of Congress who’s worked for Kamala Harris, I can provide some insight. We’ve already seen Donald Trump’s record as president. He let the ultrawealthy off the hook for paying their fair share in taxes. He weakened our international alliances. He proposed cuts to Social Security. In a second Trump term, he would do all this again. The Biden-Harris administration has cracked down on tax cheats, restored our global standing and protected Social Security. Vice President Harris would continue this work, while bringing her own leadership style. We can look to her record of public service — a record I have observed up close — to see how she works for the people. Kamala Harris took office as California’s attorney general in 2011, during the long, painful aftermath of the Great Recession. At the time, attorneys general from 49 states were negotiating with the nation’s largest banks, demanding that these institutions take responsibility for their role in the foreclosure crisis. Kamala spent months pushing for a better deal, channeling the pain she’d heard from families on the campaign trail. When the banks refused to do enough, she pulled out of the talks, which threatened to derail the compromise because of California’s size. This angered the bankers. It annoyed other attorneys general, some of whom had been in office for decades. But it was the right thing for her constituents — and it worked. She got the banks to promise more than quadruple what they initially offered to help Californians. That’s someone who can’t be bought or bullied. Now, think about Kamala bringing this tenacity to a high-level international meeting like the G7. She won’t go along to get along; she’ll do what’s right for Americans and for a safer, more peaceful world. Kamala knows that respect is not something one can petulantly demand, as Trump does. Respect comes from the moral authority of doing what’s right and speaking truth to power. Kamala was savvy to press the big banks to do more, but her most remarkable insight guided her next move. She understood that the settlement depended on the banks’ promises to change their unlawful practices — and that given their illegal conduct, it wasn’t enough just to hope that they shaped up. For Kamala, the victory wasn’t the words on the pages of the National Mortgage Settlement or the press conference announcing the deal. Families were counting on government to deliver actual help that improved their lives. Over objections from the big banks, Kamala appointed me as an independent watchdog for the settlement. She empowered me to hold the banks’ feet to the fire and to get results for Californians. I had no formal legal authority, but I had Kamala’s force of will behind me. With her backing, we halted hundreds of foreclosures and forced the banks to consider families for loan modifications. We were able to get one family a six-figure compensation check from one major bank for its flawed processes. We caught another major bank forcing consumers to sign away their right to sue for legal violations —breaking a promise it had made in the settlement — and we forced it to send out hundreds of thousands of correction letters. We successfully pressed the banks to work more to reach the hardest-hit communities, and we held workshops for service members and seniors. We changed lives on the ground. That’s how Kamala is: She sees things through, not stopping until people get help, because she cares about our families. When she called me to offer me the job as California monitor, I had a 2-month-old. Like many working moms, I had to bring my infant to work because she had nowhere else to go. I remember being embarrassed on the call, worrying if Betsy would cry or fuss while I was talking to the attorney general. I nervously confessed that I had my baby with me. Kamala didn’t hesitate. She asked how my baby and I were doing and how her siblings were adjusting. She wasn’t making small talk; she genuinely wanted to know. And then she continued to tell me about how important it was that Californians have a watchdog and a place to report any continued bank misconduct. I had a newborn, two other kids and a full-time job as a college professor. Kamala did not even blink; she expressed confidence in me to do the job and emphasized the importance of the work. This is how I know, very personally, that Americans can count on Kamala to fill her administration with the best, most qualified leaders from all walks of life to advocate for everyday Americans. There couldn’t be a clearer contrast with Donald Trump. As I exposed in congressional hearings, his appointees included a housing secretary who didn’t know basic real estate terms and a postmaster general who didn’t know how much it costs to mail a postcard. I can assure Americans from personal experience: Kamala Harris’ vision for moving America forward will not just be words on a convention stage or at a press conference. Nor will it be the empty promises and lip service that we hear from too many politicians who pose as leaders. Kamala will do what’s right and go to the mat to get it done."
14,"Why Trump pointed to a made-up meeting between Harris, Putin",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 07:36:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pointed-made-meeting-harris-putin-rcna167762,"Almost immediately after Russia’s Vladimir Putin launched an invasion into Ukraine, Donald Trump has tried to blame the war on the Biden administration. The line has never made sense — even John Bolton, Trump’s former White House national security advisor, didn’t buy it — but the former president has peddled the line in recent years anyway. In a speech in North Carolina devoted to national security, however, the Republican added a new chapter to his weird story. This was the anecdote the GOP candidate shared with supporters: At that point, Trump turned to retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and asked, “Did you know that, general?” Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Cameras didn’t capture Kellogg’s response, but I have a hunch he wasn’t familiar the story about the Harris-Putin meeting — because it only happened in Trump’s overactive imagination. Let’s briefly review a handful of pertinent details. First, Trump still doesn’t pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris’ name correctly. Second, Harris didn’t meet with Putin ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Trump, whose relationship with reality is often fractured, appears to have simply made this up. Third, the Democratic vice president, shortly before the war began, did attend the 2022 Munich Security Conference, representing the Biden administration. Trump would apparently have people believe that the vice president’s efforts were somehow a failure, but reality suggests otherwise: Harris met with officials from U.S. allies — not with Russia’s authoritarian leader — and helped solidify the Western alliance, which has been steadfast in its opposition to Moscow’s aggression. And finally, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that if anyone should avoid talking about private and undisclosed chats with Putin, it’s the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Remember this Politico report from June 2019? Months earlier, The Washington Post reported that Trump went to “extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations” with the Russian autocrat — at one point even “taking possession” of his own interpreter’s notes after a conversation with Putin. It’s a dynamic, in other words, in which Trump has to make up an imaginary conversation between Harris and Putin, while Democrats can reference actual conversations between Trump and Putin."
15,Kamala Harris made me feel seen when no one else looked,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-made-feel-seen-no-one-else-looked-rcna167341,"My wife Diana and I met Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff in the summer of 2015, when Harris and I were both preparing to run for Senate. And by preparing to run, I mean traveling the country fundraising, because the amount of money it takes to run for the U.S. Senate requires you to spend more than a year flying around gathering up cash, like a marathoner accepting little cups of water from strangers. Harris won her Senate race and I got a silver medal in mine, but we stayed in touch and I would visit her sometimes during trips to D.C. We were friends, but not super close, which is common for friendships in politics.  Despite losing that Senate race, my political profile continued to grow and for a time I was among the couple of dozen Democrats preparing to make a 2020 run for the presidency. But in the latter half of 2018, I dropped out of the 2020 presidential mix, and then out of public life for a while, to go to the VA to seek therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. I’d been putting it off since serving in Afghanistan with the Army over a decade earlier, and it caught up to me rather abruptly.  Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Just like that, I went from what the political world cynically calls a “bold faced name” to a vet with no job other than growing a beard, going to therapy, and trying to learn how to be useful around the house. When I first made the announcement, it seemed like everybody I knew, famous or otherwise, reached out. But after a while, most of those calls tapered off as people went on with their lives and I disappeared from their televisions and their social media feeds. Kamala Harris was one in a small group of people in the political world who continued to call. In fact, she checked in on me with some regularity. She would sometimes call just to catch up, or sometimes she had a big speech or meeting coming up with a veterans’ or national security group and I’d be a sounding board. I don’t know how much she actually needed my advice about that stuff when she asked for it, and I don’t know how much I helped, but her asking made me feel valuable at a time when I’d sort of given the world permission to forget about me. And I appreciated that gesture a lot.   I remember answering her call one day while pushing a cart through Costco. This was well after she was headlong into the 2020 campaign, and she had her veterans' policy person on the line because she wanted to run some language by me. Once that was done, she thanked that person and then politely asked that they go ahead and drop off the line so we could catch up.   As usual, she expressed genuine interest in how my mental health was coming along. By that point I was truly into a post-traumatic growth chapter and had moved on to a role as an executive at a national veterans nonprofit. At some point, I mentioned that I was thinking about doing some TV surrogate stuff for the campaign. It was kind of a big-deal decision for me at the time because I’d been out of the mix for almost two years by then.   She was clearly excited for me, because she spent a couple minutes describing in great detail how to set up my home office to make cable hits easy and comfortable. I still use the ring light she suggested.   My point in sharing this admittedly uneventful and humdrum anecdote is that I’m excited about the prospect of a Kamala Harris presidency not just because she’s brilliant and skilled and hardworking and believes in the right things. I’m also excited because, in my experience, she’s a downright decent person who shows people respect and makes sure they feel seen. And I’m not trying to do some humblebrag “I’m friends with the next president” flex here because I’ll be the first to tell you we’re not close friends. At best, we’re friendly acquaintances who used to work in the same field. And that’s my point. She is the type of person who is thoughtful enough to treat a peer like a peer, even when that person has bowed out and is no longer really a peer at all. And that’s the kind of everyday decency I believe she’ll bring to the presidency. "

Wednesday's interview was part of an MSNBC Live event at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Holder joined two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, MSNBC Live co-host and creative director Luke Russert, and co-host of ""The Weekend"" Symone Sanders-Townsend for a conversation focused on voting and the 2024 election. Holder pulled back the curtain on Harris' vetting process and explained how it compared to his previous experience screening running mates for former President Barack Obama in 2008: ""We had about two and a half, three months to do that. This one took 15 days."" Holder said he convened a team of about 70 lawyers from his firm, Covington & Burling, to help with the effort. According to the former attorney general, they worked around the clock, whittling down a list of about 11 candidates to Harris' final pick, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Holder said his team's research involved watching hours of videos of the candidates, telling Sanders-Townsend he looked at more videos than he's ever seen in his life. ""My YouTube hours are off the charts now,"" he said. Holder admitted there were some positives about the accelerated timeline. ""It was daunting, but the time was so short that you didn’t have time to get too anxious about it,"" he said. ""It was only at the conclusion that you said, 'I hope we got everything.' And I think we did."" Holder said it helped that Harris had ""the great ability to pick from a wide range of really qualified people."" When asked why the governor ultimately got the job, Holder explained it came down to Walz's accomplishments and his chemistry with Harris. He said the pair ""just kind of clicked."" As for his experience, Holder ticked through the governor's resume, noting his time in the military, in Congress and his tenure as a teacher. In the end, Holder said he was confident Walz would be ""a great vice president."" During the conversation, Sanders-Townsend also asked the former attorney general about rumors he could join a possible Harris administration as her chief of staff. But Holder quickly shut the speculation down, ""I’ve had a good career in government and I'm pretty satisfied with the things I've done."" He then promised to do everything in his power to ""make sure that, in fact, Kamala Harris will pick a White House chief of staff."""
17,I worked in Trump’s White House. Here’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-21 14:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/former-trump-white-house-staffer-olivia-troye-voting-kamala-harris-rcna167352,"I am a lifelong Republican who worked in the Trump White House, and the truth is that I’d rather be backing a candidate from my own party for president. But, for voters who care about preserving our democracy, our freedoms and opportunities, and our country’s standing around the world, there’s only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.  I left the Trump White House in August 2020 because I saw the danger Donald Trump posed for our country. This year, I joined Republicans for Harris, a coalition that gives voice to the millions of Republicans like me and independent voters who continue to reject the extremism and division of Trump. Trump weakened our standing on the world stage, damaged our institutions at home, and restricted our freedoms. He endangers our allies, says he’d allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to “do whatever the hell” he wants to them, and has threatened to withdraw the United States from NATO.  After losing in 2020, Trump tried to overturn a free and fair election, put his own vice president’s life in danger, and unleashed a violent mob on the U.S. Capitol that left five law enforcement officers dead. And still, the Republican Party stood by him. In the three years since, Trump has become even more unhinged, dangerous and extreme. His entire presidential campaign for 2024 is premised on seeking revenge on his political opponents. Just last week, he attacked the Republican governor of Georgia’s wife and family — who support him — since Gov. Brian Kemp was unwilling to lie about the results of the 2020 election.  Trump wants to be a dictator on day one and his MAGA loyalists are all too willing to let it happen. When a political party bends to the will of a single person and puts them on a pedestal, they’re putting party above country at the expense of the integrity of our institutions and the dignity of our democracy. It’s disgraceful. This is not the Republican Party I know and it’s certainly not a Republican Party I can support.  The good news is, we have another option in this election: someone who values democracy, will uphold the rule of law, and who is prepared to stand with our allies and provide steady leadership to the world.  Vice President Kamala Harris is building a broad coalition that includes everyone because, unlike her opponent, she knows that a president’s job is to serve all Americans, not only those who vote for her.  She will protect our freedoms — including women’s right to make their own health care decisions, while Trump wants to ban access to vital reproductive health care. She will stand by our global partners, from Israel to Ukraine to our NATO allies. She will defend our democracy and ensure we remain a nation in which nobody is above the law. She will work with anyone who’s willing to come to the table, on either side of the aisle, to deliver real results for the American people. It’s why I endorsed Harris, and it’s why I’m a proud member of Republicans for Harris.  To my fellow conservatives: The Republican Party has abandoned you. It’s not too late to reject Trump’s chaos and stand with Kamala Harris, who will defend our democracy and fight for our freedoms.  Harris has a vision for the future of our nation. Trump only wants to drag us back into the past. We have an opportunity to be part of that future, to reshape the Republican Party and to restore America’s leadership. We have a chance to join Republicans for Harris and play a part in protecting America from Trump’s MAGA party. This is the way to reset politics toward principles and end Trump’s dead-end populist movement. Our conservative values guide us to make this choice because our country and democracy depend on it."

These promises had a dual nature: to alter the way of doing politics in Washington and return to common values, while also ushering in a new, bold era for a Democratic Party that had long been in the shadow of Reagan-style Republican ideals. The rhetoric inspired voters, but achieving real change proved to be a much more significant challenge. In his Tuesday address at the Democratic National Convention, the change candidate spoke as a party elder, in a speech that recalled themes from his 2004 address. The former president and former first lady Michelle Obama remain popular, especially among Democrats. And the connection to Vice President Kamala Harris is long-standing, as Obama was a supporter of her candidacies for attorney general and U.S. Senate in California. A lot has changed since he was president; but the old Obama was still there, talking about national reconciliation and asserting that, “none of us wants to live in a country that’s bitter and divided,” and urging patience with others who don’t share all of our views. In a 2009 interview, Gwen Ifill referred to Harris as the “female Barack Obama,” describing a new group of Black politicians who chose public service over a more lucrative private sector career. And, of course, Harris served as the vice president to the politician who was once Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden. At the same time, there are some key differences. Harris isn’t the first Black presidential candidate, but she’s the first after the racial backlash of the 2016 election and the Trump presidency, the 2020 George Floyd protests, and the pushback against teaching the nation’s racial history in some states. Harris is also the child of immigrants at a time when immigration is much more polarized and higher on the public agenda than it was when Obama ran in 2008. She’s not the first woman nominee, but she’s the first to run in a post-Dobbs environment. Before becoming Biden’s vice president, she built her national profile on being adversarial toward Trump and his administration. There will be talk of unity and healing at the DNC, but there’s no denying the political climate has become more intense, and the political significance of identity issues has changed.  Obama’s legacy in the party is complicated. He obviously wanted his presidency to end with the election of his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton. Instead, Donald Trump was elected, along with a Republican-controlled Congress. Scholars of political parties, myself included, have criticized Obama’s party-building efforts and connected them to these political setbacks. His chosen leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schulz, had a tumultuous tenure. Obama didn’t do much to build up parties or progressive networks at the state level, in addition to the losses in Congress at the state level. (Although it wasn’t entirely negative; Obama accomplished some long-standing party goals, including but not limited to the Affordable Care Act and major strides in LGBTQ rights and marriage equality.) The constraints on Obama’s ability to deliver the change he promised weren’t all about the Democratic coalition, either. His was a new era of partisan rancor, driven in large part by a unified and hostile Republican opposition. Congressional Republicans refused to work with the administration, talked about making him a one-term president, and refused to even consider his 2016 Supreme Court nominee. When the GOP won control of the House in the 2010 midterms — a historic midterm-seat loss for the president’s party — the prospect of meaningful legislation largely evaporated.  In 2016, the fissure between the Bernie Sanders and Clinton factions was just taking shape, and led to some uncomfortable moments at the national convention. During the Trump years, the party has changed in a few crucial ways. For one, in the 2018 elections and beyond, record numbers of women, people of color, religious minorities and LGBTQ people have won elected office, reflecting Obama’s legacy of historic political firsts. The progressive wing of the party has asserted itself in national politics and policy with the emergence of the “squad” in the House, and significant attention to the presidential bids of Elizabeth Warren and Sanders.  If Harris wins, it’s far from assured she’ll have Democratic majorities in either house of Congress. But if she does, those majorities will look quite different from how they did in 2009.  Following Michelle Obama’s fiery speech, Barack Obama praised the patriotism and leadership of Biden in his own address. He illustrated Harris’ vision of a bolder Democratic Party, both by talking about policy (housing, labor rights) and also delivering a scathing takedown of Trump and Trumpism. He offered a telling detail about how the Democratic Party has shifted, at one point noting that Harris, as California AG, pushed him on legal action against predatory mortgage lenders. While Obama wove these together by suggesting that his — and the Democrats’ — philosophy is one of “mutual responsibility,” the tension between boldness and reconciliation may be even higher now than it was in 2009 or even 2016. Presidents always balance competing imperatives to lead country and party. And after the presidencies of both Trump and Biden, Harris navigates an environment in which both have changed. In 2008, Obama highlighted his policy differences with his opponent, John McCain, and suggested that Republican ideas had failed, capitalizing on the sour public mood at the end of the George W. Bush presidency. Harris will undoubtedly stress policy differences as well, focusing on Trump’s connections with Project 2025. But it’s hard to imagine Obama calling McCain “weird” as a central line of attack. Obama ran after eight years of a Republican-controlled White House, affording him room to attack and promise reinvention. Harris runs as the sitting vice president, facing a delicate balance between affirming the administration she’s served in while forging her own political identity. But in the changed political environment since 2016, she may prove to be more of a change candidate in the end."

On Tuesday, a Donald Trump campaign spokesperson appeared to co-opt the song, using it in a video of the former president deplaning in Michigan for a campaign event. “Touchdown in Michigan!!” Steven Cheung wrote in the post on X. He also tagged Trump, who recently returned to the platform. The Trump campaign has used songs without artists’ permission over the years. Several musicians or their estates have asked Trump to stop using their songs at his rallies, and some have threatened legal action. The GOP campaign spokesperson’s use of a song that Harris had established as her anthem of sorts is somewhat ironic. Trump recently accused the Democratic nominee of stealing his proposal to end taxes on tips, a policy she floated earlier this month and one he initially put forward in June. (Though neither candidate has released their full plan, many economists have criticized the idea, saying it would result in workers pressuring customers to tip more and encourage Americans to declare more of their income as tips.) Cheung’s video may prompt legal action from Beyoncé, who is known to be protective over the rights to her music. The singer has not commented publicly on the video. When reached for comment by The Hill, Cheung responded: “Freedom, freedom!”"
20,Kamala Harris’ Georgia trip highlights a savvy broader strategy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-31 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-georgia-trip-beat-trump-rcna169018,"This week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz went boldly where no major presidential campaign has gone in several decades… Savannah, Georgia.  This is a big deal because it signals the Harris-Walz campaign is not relying solely on running up vote totals in heavily Democratic Atlanta and its nearby suburbs; Democrats are also trying to narrow the margins in the more conservative, rural areas. In those locations, it is not about actually winning whole towns or counties; it's about losing them by less. The strategy reminds me of how Barack Obama approached the Iowa caucuses in 2007 and his 2004 Senate campaign before that. He showed up in both blue counties and blue cities and in rural counties, small towns and places where many people were surprised to see him.   This was also the strategy Sen. Raphael Warnock implemented in 2020 and 2022 in Georgia. Warnock’s former campaign manager Quentin Folks is now Harris’ principal deputy campaign manager. A rural Georgia native, Folks recently said, “You have to really stave down margins and go places even when you don’t think you can win it outright… You know you’re going to lose that county, but just showing up there can sometimes be the difference between 5 to 10 percentage points, or sometimes just putting an office there.” One bus tour does not win an election, but it does show a willingness by the Harris-Walz campaign to meet people where they are and to put in the work of showing up. As much as politics has changed over the last several years, it turns out there’s still value in a good old fashioned bus tour. On Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment against Donald Trump in Smith’s federal election subversion case. Smith re-tooled the indictment in an effort to take out anything that could violate the Supreme Court’s July ruling on immunity — basically anything that leaned too heavily into Trump’s official role as president.  That meant removing allegations that Trump used the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud, and reshaping the way the indictment described Mike Pence’s role in the election certification process. It also required Smith going to an entirely new grand jury. And while none of that should have been necessary, Andrew Weissmann has pointed out that now five grand juries have found probable cause to believe Trump committed multiple felonies. That’s not a small thing. This trial will not see the inside of a courtroom before the election, and if Trump is elected it probably won’t proceed at all. But for now, Smith isn’t giving up. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a mullet at the DNC. But I think it’s fair to say there will likely be more mullets in the event’s future.  For many, the August convention was their first introduction to John Russell, also known as “mullet guy.” But if you’re on TikTok, you’ve probably known about him for a long time. Whether interviewing labor leaders like UAW president Shawn Fain or educating people about CEO pay, Russell has been making waves as an activist and content creator for years. If you’re interested in hearing more from Russell, make sure to check out his Substack (“The Holler”), or you can find him across social media at the handle @heyjohnrussell. What, besides his trademark hairstyle, makes Russell stand out? It’s not just his self-described role as a “dirtbag journalist” or his background as a seasoned dive bartender — Russell knows how to speak to the party’s base, wherever they are. This fantastic video of him interviewing swing voters in Elliott County, Kentucky is a great example.  You can watch my interview with Russell this Sunday at 12 p.m. ET, where we’ll be talking all things labor, DNC, and mullet maintenance. What show are you bingeing right now? We’re doing a lot of hanging out on YouTube right now. I’ve been really loving Dan Toomey’s show “Good Work.” It does my favorite thing, which is wrapping serious and boring topics in comedy, kind of like how you wrap your dog’s medicine in cheese.  What’s the last book you read? “The Long Deep Grudge: A Story of Big Capital, Radical Labor, and Class War in the American Heartland” by Toni Gilpin.  What time do you wake up on the weekends? When my body tells me to, which depends heavily on the events of Friday night.  How do you take your coffee? In my belly, no matter what’s in the coffee. "
21,Why Harris and Walz's first major interview was a win for the campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 12:02:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-tim-walz-interview-cnn-media-rcna169019,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 30 episode of ""José Díaz-Balart Reports."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s first joint interview aired on CNN on Thursday night, and, based on what I saw, the Harris campaign should be quite proud. The candidate at the top of the ticket, Harris, went out and did what she needed to do. As for Walz, the governor was able to speak directly to the American people about the Republican attacks on his military service and set the record straight. For voters outside of Minnesota who are less familiar with Walz, I’m sure they got some of the answers they may have been looking for.  The discourse over the last few weeks would have you believe that Harris hadn’t sat down for an interview since she became the vice president. But the way she handled herself Thursday, it was clear she was comfortable answering questions. CNN’s Dana Bash did a good job at pulling the layers back and digging into what the American people really wanted to hear.  People will always want more, but Thursday’s interview was a great start. Going forward, voters need more opportunities to hear from the Democratic ticket — in various ways — whether that be more sit-down TV interviews, print interviews or gaggles with the media between campaign stops. Overall, there was no harm done to the Harris-Walz campaign during the interview and a little news was broken. As a communications veteran, that’s a win from my perspective.

22,Let's dispel the myth that Harris will be any different from Biden on Gaza and Israel,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 10:54:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-cnn-biden-rcna168949,"Vice President Kamala Harris said U.S. policy on arming Israel will not change if she is elected president, echoing the Biden administration's line on expressing tepid sympathy for Palestinians being killed and starved in Gaza while staunchly affirming support for Israel's vicious military conduct in the war. In her first interview as the Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday, Harris showed that she is in lockstep with President Joe Biden on the issue, rejecting calls — including from fellow Democrats — to withhold weapons from Israel over its siege on Gaza. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 40,000 people so far and injured more than 93,000, according to health officials in Gaza. “Let me be very clear: I am unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself, and that’s not going to change,” Harris told CNN when asked whether she would halt “some” arms shipments to Israel. She went on to talk in detail about Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, which killed 1,200 people. “As I said then, I say today: Israel ... has a right to defend itself. We would,” she said. “And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” When asked flat-out whether her policy would differ from Biden's on ""arms and so forth,"" Harris said no. She then spoke about the urgency in landing an agreement to release the hostages held by Hamas and secure a cease-fire in Gaza, a deal she said would end the war and “unlock so much of what must happen next.” “I remain committed since I’ve been on Oct. 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and, in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,” she added. Conditioning weapons shipments to Israel has been a chief demand from pro-Palestinian activists. Biden himself had threatened to withhold supplying arms to Israel over its assault on Gaza in May, but that threat ultimately proved empty. If there was any hope that Harris’ approach would be meaningfully different than Biden’s — that she might stop providing political and unconditional military support to Israel in this war, and that she might be willing to seriously pressure Israel to adhere to international law in its military operations in Gaza — those hopes were entirely crushed by her remarks on Thursday. As vice president, Harris’ rhetoric on the deep suffering of Palestinians set her apart from the Biden administration’s actions. Her comments afforded Biden some political cover, and after he withdrew his re-election bid, there was optimism that a Harris administration would take a more just, humane position. But as a presidential candidate herself now, Harris is showing that she is ultimately no more politically or morally courageous on this issue than Biden."
23,Why Kamala Harris is messaging Latino voters without using the word 'Latino',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 09:49:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-poll-latino-hispanic-voter-election-rcna168830,"It’s still early days, but Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance among Latino voters is looking promising. According to a Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday, 56% of Latino registered voters prefer Harris, compared to 34% for former President Donald Trump. That’s a significant surge from when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July; at that time the same poll found Harris was leading by just 6 percentage points, 44% to 38%. This comes as recent polling data from Equis Research, a research organization focused on the Latino electorate, has found that Harris’ entry into the race has let Democrats “reset” with Latinos and that she is outperforming Biden’s 2024 campaign with this demographic.  Yet despite this good news, Harris has yet to reach Biden’s levels of Latino support in the 2020 campaign, according to Equis. As she looks to rebound even further with Latinos, Harris’ campaign is trying a new tack: approaching them pretty similarly to the way they approach all American voters. As The New York Times notes, Harris’ first ad targeting Latino voters, released a few weeks ago, departed from Democrats’ standard messaging toward the demographic in a striking manner. The ad begins with a mention of Harris’ “immigrant mother,” but it makes no explicit mention of Latino identity or immigration as a policy issue. Instead, it discusses Harris’ record and commitment to fighting corporate exploitation, lowering costs of housing and drug prices, and defending abortion rights. In other words — the same set of issues that Harris has been hammering home in her campaign appearances. The ad represents a gamble: Democrats are experimenting with a new approach to attracting one of the most important demographics in the American electorate in a tight race. But it’s one I’m cautiously optimistic about, because what Democrats were doing previously wasn’t working terribly well. Latino voters have leaned toward Democrats for decades. But they are not a monolith. For example, a majority of Cuban American registered voters identified as Republicans in 2020, in part because of their familiarity with and objections to the left-wing government in Cuba. Moreover, Latinos are a relatively young demographic and their views are in flux. Trump performed better with Latinos in 2020 than he did in 2016, and since then Latinos have continued to identify with Republican Party in even greater numbers. Biden was looking even worse this time around with the demographic until he dropped out. For some people, this is counterintuitive. Trump’s offensive comments about immigrants, draconian immigration policies and his nationalism might seem like they would turn off a community of voters who often have ties to recent immigrants — or are immigrants themselves. But the data makes it clear that it’s a mistake to assume that Latinos are categorically different from other Americans when it comes to their positions on immigration and how much they care about the issue. Earlier this year, Equis found that Latinos in seven battleground states trusted Trump more than Biden on immigration policy. And despite the trope of Latinos as immigration focused, polls find that they’re far more concerned about the economy than anything else —  just like most Americans. In other words, it’s not only a mistake to assume Latinos are immigration doves, but also that it’s a top tier issue for them. Harris has wisely declined to focus heavily on her own racial and gender identity in her campaign, instead placing her focus squarely on kitchen table issues. An approach to Latino voters that channels that same energy — with some targeted tweaks in tone and framing, as the aforementioned ad did effectively — is consistent with that attitude.  There are reasons to think it could bear fruit. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign was unusually effective at garnering Latino voters, something his Latino press secretary, Belén Sisa, attributed in part to his class-first approach. Here’s how she explained his popularity among Latinos in an interview in 2020: Harris’ economic policy platform isn’t nearly as progressive as that of Sanders, but its focus on lowering costs and calling out corporations could resonate similarly. Of course, messaging alone won’t do the trick —  Sanders’ campaign made a serious push to aggressively invest in Latino outreach from the very beginning of its campaign. Carlos Odio, a co-founder of Equis, recently emphasized to New York Magazine that Latinos are “the swingiest element of the electorate more broadly, are these low-propensity irregular voters who don’t have fully formed partisan identities.” One thing we know about swing voters and irregular voters is that they care a ton about the economic picture. To win this election, Harris has to paint a good one. "
24,"In interview, Harris vows to include a Republican in her Cabinet",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 07:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/interview-harris-vows-include-republican-cabinet-rcna168968,"In her first major television interview since President Joe Biden ended his re-election plans, Vice President Kamala Harris broke some new ground with CNN’s Dana Bash: The Democratic nominee vowed to appoint at least one Republican to her White House Cabinet if elected. As The Washington Post reported: She prefaced her comments by saying, “I’ve got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would, I think, [add bipartisanship to the White House Cabinet]. I think it’s really important.” The vice president didn’t reference any Republicans by name, though it’s easy to identify some of the GOP figures who’d be in contention. After all, Harris has already received endorsements from a variety of notable Republicans — some of whom are currently in office, others who are former officials — and Democrats included several GOP speakers at the party’s national convention in Chicago. It’s worth noting for context that this wasn’t just a stray comment for Harris: Before the interview even aired in its entirety on CNN, the Democrat’s campaign issued a press statement promoting the vow about adding a Republican to her prospective Cabinet and encouraging people to watch a video excerpt of her comments. In other words, Team Harris leaned into this one. There’s no great mystery as to why: Trump appears to have overwhelming support on the right, but the Democratic candidate believes she can assemble an electoral coalition that includes independents and GOP voters who might be skeptical of their party’s scandal-plagued nominee. The Cabinet vow bolsters her credibility on bipartisanship. What’s more, it ties Harris to a modern, pre-Trump tradition of sorts. The Washington Monthly’s Bill Scher — in a piece published before the CNN interview — explained, “[A] modicum of cross-pollination in a cabinet is historically common. Every president, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Barack Obama, had at least one cabinet member from the opposite party for some time during their administrations. Obama appointed three Republicans to his cabinet, including Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former CIA Director Robert Gates as secretaries of defense, and his Illinois colleague, Representative Ray LaHood, as transportation secretary.” Trump broke the streak, and despite his many bipartisan victories, Biden hasn’t had any GOP members on his Cabinet. Harris, however, apparently intends to restore the modern trend. Will Trump respond in kind with a comparable promise? It’s possible, though it’s difficult to imagine what Democrat would agree to join his team."
25,Kamala Harris is reaching out to rural voters. That will help her win — and govern.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-bus-tour-rural-voters-rcna168615,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' barnstorming tour of rural Georgia showed not only her plan to win the election, but also how she would govern as president. While Donald Trump has long made clear that his only priority is ""his"" voters, Harris' bus tour of Southeast Georgia with running mate Tim Walz showed that she knows the president is supposed to represent every American. Over two days, Harris and Walz met with voters, students and business owners before Harris held a solo rally in Savannah on Thursday. The campaign says this was the first time a general election presidential nominee stumped in the coastal city of Savannah since the 1990s. Bill Clinton and Al Gore also prioritized rural parts of the state on a similar bus tour during their successful 1992 campaign (the last time Democrats picked up Georgia in a presidential election before President Joe Biden and Harris narrowly flipped the state back in 2020). But the investment in the Harris-Walz campaign’s playbook to defend toss-up Georgia goes beyond the bus. It expands their footprint across the state, what the campaign calls the “largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle.”  Earlier this month on “The Weekend,” Harris-Walz's principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks (who led Georgia Sen. Raphael’s Warnock’s successful statewide run), said the campaign’s rural voter outreach demonstrates how Harris would run an “inclusive” administration. Fulks added that Harris and Walz are “fighting for all Americans regardless of if your county votes red or your county votes blue.”   Harris’ “inclusive” campaign strategy isn’t reserved for just the Peach State. Harris and Walz kicked off their bus tour earlier this month, meeting with voters in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, a county Trump won in 2020 by nearly 18 points. And Walz hosted his first solo rally in his home state of Nebraska. The Cornhusker State is one of two states that divides up electoral votes by congressional district. While most of Nebraska is red, Harris and Walz hope to secure the electoral vote in the state’s swing 2nd District. That strategy is about raw vote totals, but it’s also about the ethos of Harris’ campaign. “I promise to be a president for all Americans,” the vice president said during her convention acceptance speech. “You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power,” Harris declared. Georgia voters know a thing or two about the need to preserve free and fair elections. Trump and his allies worked to nullify their votes in 2020, and Georgia Democrats are already bracing for Trump’s effort to possibly challenge election results in November. The DNC and Democratic Party of Georgia sued the Georgia State Election Board this week over new rules they fear could interfere with the vote certification. An overwhelming win by Harris in the state would make it harder for Trump and his allies to overturn the results. That’s why the campaign is working to reach voters in every part of the state, no matter their ZIP code.   But Harris’ plan to win Georgia sends a clear message to voters in other states: She’s ready to serve every American. Listening to the voices of Americans across the political spectrum will not just help her campaign; it will help her govern.

""Kamala is a joyful warrior,"" Emhoff said, employing a term that has come to define her campaign. ""And here’s the thing about joyful warriors: They’re still warriors, and Kamala is as tough as they come."" Emhoff charted his relationship with Harris from their first blind date — ""For generations, people have debated when to call the person you're being set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m., and yet that's when I dialed."" — to how easily she fit in with his family. Emhoff, who has two children from a previous marriage, spoke affectionately about his blended family, which right-wing figures have sought to make a point of attack against Harris for not having biological children. “Those of you who belong in blended families know that they can be a little complicated,” he said. “But as soon as our kids started calling her ‘Momala,’ I knew we’d be OK.” Emhoff's speech on the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a reintroduction of sorts for himself, too. He talked about his childhood in New Jersey and his fantasy football league. The first Jewish spouse of a U.S. president or vice president, Emhoff said that Harris — who is Baptist and was raised in a Christian and Hindu household — has helped deepen his connection to his faith. Harris is scheduled to accept her party’s nomination Thursday, which Emhoff said is also their 10th wedding anniversary. He urged voters to trust Harris with their families as he did his. ""America, in this election you have to decide who to trust with your family’s future,"" he said. ""I trusted Kamala with our family’s future; it was the best decision I ever made."""
27,Biden’s greatest gift to Kamala Harris is a united Democratic Party,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 14:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-biden-harris-speakers-sanders-aoc-clinton-rcna167360,"The first night of the Democratic National Convention concluded with President Joe Biden’s valedictory speech passing the proverbial torch to his vice president, Kamala Harris. But the proceedings before Biden’s address, which closed with the two hugging on stage, made clear Biden has done more than hand off a presidential nomination. He’s also bequeathed her a party that, thanks in part to his efforts, is perhaps more united than any time in history. Eight years ago, at the 2016 Democratic convention, the divide between partisans for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was impossible to ignore. Sanders’ supporters remained bitter about his defeat in the 2016 primaries, with many falsely accusing the DNC of rigging the election against him — and staging large protests in the streets of Philadelphia. Hundreds of his supporters walked out of the convention hall when Clinton officially clinched the nomination, while those who stayed held up signs criticizing Clinton and maintaining their support for Sanders. Given the narrowness of that November’s election, the left-wing insurgency against Clinton arguably contributed to her defeat. None of these divisions will be evident this week. On Tuesday night, Sanders will deliver a prime-time address, following last night’s similarly plum speaking spot for the woman who seconded his nomination at the 2020 convention: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Indeed, Ocasio-Cortez might have bumped into Clinton backstage on Monday night, as the two spoke just minutes apart. Even more importantly, both women offered similar messages supporting Biden’s accomplishments and Kamala Harris’s promise. The Democratic Party still has some divisions, particularly over the war in Gaza, but even on that issue, there is far more unanimity among elected Democrats than it might seem. On Monday night, when Ocasio-Cortez called for a cease-fire in Gaza and a return of Israeli hostages, she was endorsing the White House’s position on the issue. This new spirit of party unity is driven, in part, by vast and often underappreciated shifts within the two parties. In the run-up to this week’s convention in Chicago, much was written about comparing this event to the party’s Windy City convention in 1968. But for all the similarities, many of those present in Chicago 56 years ago would likely not recognize the Democratic Party of today.  In 1968, there were significant and unbridgeable differences among Democrats over the war in Vietnam, civil rights, law and order and even the proper role of government in the lives of the American people.  In fact, for a good chunk of the Democratic Party’s modern history, there were two distinct political wings — a Southern wing of unreconstructed segregationists and a Northern wing of more liberal Democrats and Black Americans.  But over the past two decades, the South has become increasingly dominated by the GOP, while Democrats have conquered the North and the West Coast. Moderate Democrats — and moderate Republicans — have gone the way of the dodo bird. Polarization has led to less split-ticket voting and greatly decreased the incentives for members of either party to avoid party dogma. The two parties have gone from being unwieldy heterogeneous groupings to largely homogenous political constellations.  But despite greater ideological agreement, the divisions in 2016 were real and serious. Biden has gone out of his way to smooth them over. When he won the Democratic nomination in 2020, with Sanders again the runner-up, Biden did the opposite of what most presumptive nominees have traditionally done — rather than run to the political center, he extended an olive branch to the left. He adopted key elements of the left’s policy agenda on everything from crime and the environment to education, health care and trade.  Biden’s actions as the nominee befitted a politician who navigated between the center and left in his decades in the Senate and seemingly always ended up smack dab in the middle of the two sides. As president, Biden continued this balancing act — maintaining lines of communication with the left and supporting parts of their policy agenda, most notably on the issue of student loan forgiveness. While other Democratic presidents (see Bill Clinton and Barack Obama) have had adversarial relationships with the left, Biden has been the exact opposite. It was small wonder that in July, when many Democrats were clamoring for Biden to step down as party nominee, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders and their allies were among the biggest proponents of Biden staying on the ticket. To be sure, the specter of another Trump term in office is perhaps the strongest unifying force for Democrats. Still, when it comes to hot-button issues that once divided the party — abortion, guns, immigration, trade, unions, civil rights, even criticisms of corporate America — there is little evident daylight among Democrats. That has helped create a striking sense of unity this week that goes well beyond antipathy toward the GOP nominee.  While Republicans are seemingly united by their support of Donald Trump, the seamless shift from Biden to Harris shows that Democrats, in 2024, are largely signing from the same policy hymnal. Even more than his full-throated endorsement of Harris, this might be Biden’s biggest gift to her — and to the Democratic Party."
28,The Harris-Walz campaign announces a big social media push,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 13:59:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-walz-campaign-whatsapp-latinos-social-media-rcna167439,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, a round-up of the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. The Harris-Walz campaign announced the launch of a WhatsApp channel, expanding its social media outreach to the messaging app that’s immensely popular in some Latino communities. The move can also be seen partly as an effort to combat the spread of right-wing misinformation on the platform: A Nielsen report in 2021 found Latinos were more likely than other groups to receive, consume and share misinformation, and it cited WhatsApp as a hub where much of that misinformation was exchanged.

The U.S. intelligence community is alleging Iran is responsible for hacking attempts targeting both Vice President Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s presidential campaigns (at the moment, only the Trump campaign has said it was hacked). Iran denies the claim, and while several news outlets say they have received campaign materials from a source identifying itself only as ""Robert,"" none of those outlets have shared what they've received. As my colleague Steve Benen wrote, this is in line with what Trump’s campaign has demanded of the press, even though he took completely the opposite approach when Hillary Clinton’s campaign was hacked by Russia in 2016.

29,What Kamala Harris needs to say about Gaza at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 10:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-gaza-dnc-biden-rcna166752,"When it comes to the suffering in Gaza, Vice President Kamala Harris is not President Joe Biden. The people Biden angered with his words, his policies and his “bear hug” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already get that. In fact, the leaders of Michigan’s “uncommitted” movement, who in February convinced more than 100,000 voters to not support Biden in the state’s presidential primary election, have made that very point. In 2020, nearly an estimated 69% of Arab or Muslim voters supported Biden. As Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the uncommitted movement, said at a recent news conference, “There are early indications that there is an openness to engaging with our movement that feels like a shift from how our requests were being treated previously.” Layla Elabed, another co-founder, counted it a positive sign that Harris’ comments after meeting with Netanyahu in July included mention of the horrific suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Harris pointed to “the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time … We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.” Then, she added powerfully, “And I will not be silent.” But the leaders of this movement, which also includes large numbers in other swing states, note that for Harris to truly inspire people, she needs to do more than change tone. She must articulate a new way forward. And the perfect place to do that is at this week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. On the upside, the movement is already seeing results with the Democratic National Committee, on Day One of the convention, holding the first official panel to discuss Palestinian human rights. Panelists included Elabed, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and former Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich. In advance, the uncommitted movement called the panel “an important step toward recognizing the rightful place of human rights advocates for Palestinian rights within the Democratic Party.” And to Harris’ credit, she broke from Biden on his Gaza policy in early March, long before she became her party’s presidential nominee. At the annual commemoration of “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Alabama, she became the most senior member of the Biden administration to publicly call for a cease-fire in the Gaza war. She spoke then of the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and said, “What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed, women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration.” She poignantly added, “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” While Harris reiterated the Biden administration’s “unwavering” commitment to Israel’s security, at the same time, she criticized Netanyahu for imposing restrictions on humanitarian relief and said there can be “no excuses” for not allowing food, water and other supplies into Gaza. Harris’ remarks were a far cry from Biden’s comments weeks after Hamas’ horrific Oct. 7 terrorist attack and Netanyahu’s brutal response that has killed thousands of civilians and collectively punished the more than 2 million people of Gaza. When he was asked then to respond to reports that nearly 2,700 Palestinian children had been killed by Israeli military action, Biden said coldly, “I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed.” Then he added, “I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war.” Since then, Biden has expressed far more compassion for Palestinian suffering, most notably at the State of the Union address where he spoke of the “heartbreaking” killing of “thousands and thousands” of “innocent women and children” and he has worked for a cease-fire. However, to many, Biden’s pivot comes across as less of an organic shift and more like a response to the political pressure. Not only was the uncommitted movement exerting such pressure, but polling from around that time showed that only 36 percent of Democrats approved of Netanyahu’s military actions in Gaza. Add to that, Biden was being vocally pressed to change course in Gaza by Black leaders who represented a core part of his base. But Harris represents something unique for the 80 percent of Democrats who have long supported a cease-fire in Gaza. She is a person of color. For many in the Arab and Muslim community, she looks like family. Both of her parents, as she notes in her book, “The Truths We Hold,” grew up under British colonial rule: her father in Jamaica and her mother in India. And it was her parents’ activism, especially her mother’s participation in the U.S. civil rights movement, that inspired her to become active in politics. Harris’ family history enables her — in a way that Biden cannot — to viscerally understand the pain of a people, in this case the Palestinians, seeking self-determination and equal rights.  I have heard an openness to voting for Harris from many in the Arab and Muslim community — some of whom had vocally opposed Biden because of his Gaza policy. They applaud her words, but policy matters far more. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn, Michigan, made that point on NPR after praising Harris’ criticism of Netanyahu. “What we want is more than just someone who is tough on rhetoric,” he said. “We want somebody who is tough on policy.” The Democratic convention is the perfect platform for Harris to address this. She needs to use this moment to share a policy-based vision for going forward. She needs to expound upon the comments she made after meeting Netanyahu last month, when she spoke of ensuring that “the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.” Consistent with that, she could condition aid to Israel based on committing to a two-state solution. Harris could also vow to enforce the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which requires that any security assistance or military equipment provided to another country by the United States be used in accordance with internationally recognized human rights. This is the very law that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other Democrats want enforced against Netanyahu’s administration. And the list goes on of possible policy prescriptions Harris could announce to show a commitment beyond words, including a potential arms embargo if Netanyahu refuses to use U.S.-supplied weapons in accordance with international law, or she could promise to no longer protect Netanyahu and his administration before the U.N. Security Council by vetoing resolutions that target his government. She could also vow to impose additional U.S. sanctions on extreme settlers engaged in violence directed at Palestinians in the West Bank — where my relatives live. We all get that former President Donald Trump would be far worse for the Palestinian people and for our communities here in the United States. As president, Trump delivered all the right-wing wishes of Netanyahu, including moving the U.S.embassy to Jerusalem, no longer viewing Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal — despite international law to the contrary — and cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to agencies that provide vitally needed assistance to Palestinian refugees. And during his 2024 campaign, Trump has not only cheered on Netanyahu’s war in Gaza but has used the term “Palestinian” as a slur to describe Biden and even Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Few in the uncommitted camp — if any — will vote for Trump. But inspiring the hundreds of thousands of Arabs and Muslims and our allies in swing states from Michigan to Georgia to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania will take more than good vibes from Harris. It will take a well-articulated policy."
30,How Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are charting new territory in normcore,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-doritos-tim-walz-normal-trump-weird-rcna167193,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz single-handedly launched “weird” as the Democrats’ go-to insult for the MAGA crowd this summer. Now he and Vice President Kamala Harris, who has chosen Walz as the running mate in her presidential campaign, are fleshing out for voters the other side of the equation: what it looks like to be “normal.” And it’s going surprisingly well. In short videos shared over social media in recent days, Harris’ presidential campaign has generated a series of viral clips that capture private conversations between Harris and Walz that come across as intimate and improvised. The videos are warm in tone and often funny, and they show the candidates discussing mundane, apolitical topics like food and music.  Over the weekend, Walz posted a video on X showing the two of them searching for snacks at a rest stop during their “Road to Chicago” bus tour. Harris peruses one aisle alongside her husband while asking Walz, “Do you see corn nuts over there, Tim?” Walz then emerges from another with another snack: a big bag of Doritos. Harris gratefully grabs the bag, exclaiming “ah, yeah,” and then immediately continues to hunt for other snacks. The clip lasts just 10 seconds, but it’s strangely arresting. It showcases a scene instantly recognizable to just about any American: hungry road-trippers looking for and discussing their favorite snacks, a familiar blend of tedium and small delights. Whether the scene was in any way orchestrated, the pair come off as relatable humans, and they comport themselves in a way one rarely sees politicians do. Walz’s snack suggestion also incidentally doubles as a reference to Harris’ recent confession that she binged on a “family-sized bag of nacho Doritos” after President Donald Trump won the White House — another recent piece of normcore rhetoric. Harris’ campaign also released video last week of Harris and Walz getting to know each other filled with some genuinely funny moments. In a one-on-one exchange, Walz discloses his affection for “white guy tacos” — that is, tacos without spice — to the consternation of Harris, who reminds him she grew chili peppers at the vice president’s residence. In another moment, the two exchange their favorite music (Harris talks about her mother’s Aretha Franklin super fandom; Walz describes his love for Bruce Springsteen). They also released video of Harris’ first attempt to call Walz to officially ask him to be her running mate, which Walz accidentally missed. It’s impossible to know how much, if any, of these exchanges may have been discussed in advance. But it’s obvious that the conversations are heavily improvised. They’re politicians, not actors, and their laughter, jokes and commentary radiate the warmth of two people with conversational chemistry and a discernible interest in the world outside of politics. Even some of the videos capturing Harris and Walz’s campaign activities have a conspicuously casual tone, showing Harris petting dogs and campaigning once again in Converse Chuck Taylors. And Walz is a normcore warrior on the campaign trail, slamming Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance for faking kinship with the working class he scorns using references to food. Harris’ campaign has struck upon a fresh and surprisingly engaging communication strategy. All politicians want to appear as ordinary citizens who understand the way other ordinary citizens live. But achieving that often involves awkward contrivances, such as stuffing corn dogs into their mouths in front of hordes of journalists at a county fair. Harris’ campaign has avoided hokey press spectacles and instead leveraged smart video production and social media to brandish its normie credentials. Beyond being clever, Harris and Walz’s normcore aesthetic buttresses the emerging populist themes of Harris’ campaign as she goes about unveiling progressive economic policies on housing, medical debt and the child tax credit. And it marks a concerted attempt to contest the claim that far too many have bought: that Trump speaks on behalf of so-called real America. (It is difficult to imagine imperious billionaire Trump and his awkward, chameleon of a running mate, Vance, ever chatting it up so naturally anywhere, but especially not at a rest stop.) Harris cannot win an election based purely on impressive social media optics and normie vibes. Nor should she. But if she can make a substantive case for how she can make America and the world more just for the masses through progressive policies, then channeling the everywoman and everyman vibes will be more than just a convincing shtick."
31,Kamala Harris faces huge test on Gaza at DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 14:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-dnc-test-israel-gaza-rcna167217,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 18 episode of ""Ayman."" As the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago, polls show that the presidential race is shifting in Democrats’ favor. Since President Joe Biden dropped out, the party has rallied around Vice President Kamala Harris and public opinion has followed.  The emergence of Harris as a presidential contender and the selection of Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate have breathed new life into the Democratic Party — injecting supporters with excitement, hope and even joy.  However, a lot can change between now and November. Harris is still in a neck-and-neck race with Donald Trump, a man convicted of 34 felony counts who tried to overturn the last election. It’s clear the stakes of this convention couldn’t be any higher. In her first few weeks as the Democratic nominee, Harris has already proven herself capable of making big and bold decisions. When most Democratic strategists wanted her to pick a running mate with the pundit-approved label of “centrist” or “moderate,” she went her own way and selected Walz, who has successfully passed a progressive agenda as governor.  Last week, knowing that Republicans stood ready to label her a socialist or even a communist, she unveiled a populist economic agenda, including a plan to combat price gouging by grocery store chains. However, there is one issue on which she has not yet displayed this boldness or willingness to confront powerful interests. It’s the same issue that sunk Biden in the polls long before his disastrous debate performance. As Farah Stockman wrote in The New York Times: The key word there is “substance.” Harris has already proven adept at showing more compassion and empathy toward Palestinians than does Biden, who came across to some as cold, cruel and clueless.  But that bar is extremely low. Empty words won’t bring back the more than 40,000 Palestinians, including more than 16,000 children, who have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in these last 10 months, according to health officials in Gaza. The American position can’t be “I feel your pain” while we’re the ones supplying bombs causing that pain. That’s why more than 150 groups nationwide have joined a coalition to march at the DNC with estimates that tens of thousands will be there protesting. How Harris and the Democrats deal with this — not just the protests themselves but the substance of this issue — may be her biggest test heading into the DNC."
32,Harris and Walz are hitting Trump where it hurts: his masculinity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 11:17:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-rally-trump-masculinity-gender-attacks-rcna167214,"During a campaign stop in Rochester, Pennsylvania, over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris lobbed a volley in her war on Donald Trump’s hypermasculine ways, criticizing the “perversion” and “coward”-like behavior undergirding the bravado. It was a nice reversal of the usual gendered rhetoric. Trump’s attacks on Harris have dripped with misogyny and general creepiness since she emerged as the Democratic nominee. He’s repeatedly insulted her intelligence; lately, he’s resorted to commenting about her physical appearance as well. Meanwhile, the campaign and allies in conservative media have tried to broaden his appeal with male voters while deploying some rather juvenile tactics. But Trump’s increasingly hypermasculine persona — a toxic mixture of Al Bundy from ""Married ... With Children"" and Biff Tannen from “Back to the Future” — arguably gives Democrats an opening. Even when President Joe Biden was still running, Democrats made concerted efforts to attack Trump’s performative masculinity and bullying behavior to discourage men from following in his path. And the Harris-Walz ticket has afforded Democrats more opportunity to attack toxic MAGA masculinity, with an uncowed woman leading the ticket and her running mate offering a comparatively kinder, more compassionate depiction of masculinity than is being offered by Trump and his followers.  And Harris launched a pointed attack of her own on Sunday, contrasting how her campaign perceives strength with how … others … do.  She said:  Harris didn’t need to mention Trump by name for viewers to know who she was referencing. The sentiment here — that bullies are cowardly and weak at heart — aligns with comments Tim Walz made about the MAGA movement when he was being considered as Harris’ potential running mate. I’m on the record with my belief that these kinds of attacks on Trumpy hypermasculinity are likely to be valuable for Democrats. Trump and his movement portray strength as the key to manhood. And we know one of his key metrics for strength is one’s ability to vanquish or humiliate his political foes. The fact a campaign led by a Black woman is taking him to task for this “perverse” idea seems likely to goad him into more misogynistic outbursts, which don’t appear to be helping him.  And simultaneously, in attacking Trump’s bullying behavior, the Harris-Walz campaign can do lasting good by arguing — to all Americans, but certainly, the men who need it most — that true power is about aiding others, not trampling on them."
33,Why Beyoncé's 'Freedom' is the perfect campaign song for Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/beyonce-kamala-harris-freedom-rcna166745,"In the voice-over for Vice President Kamala Harris’ first campaign ad as a 2024 presidential candidate, we heard her lay out her objectives for America — ­ranging from reducing gun violence, poverty and health care costs to codifying reproductive rights — and we see a racially diverse mix of enthusiastic voters, multigenerational families, union workers, the LGBTQ+ community, Harris on the campaign trail and headlines about Donald Trump’s conviction in Manhattan. We also heard a familiar song playing. That song is Beyoncé’s 2016 anthem “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar, which Beyoncé permitted Harris to use as her walk-out song during her first public appearance as a presidential candidate. It’s also the official campaign (and theme) song of Harris’ 2024 presidential bid. With its liberating tone, the song, which was used as a battle cry for many Black Lives Matter demonstrations following the 2020 death of George Floyd, now evokes the aspirational promise of the Democratic Party. Alongside the pounding, warlike drums and fiery rock pulse, Beyoncé’s voice roars, “I’ma keep running ’cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.”Great campaign songs often toe a fine line between galvanizing a political party’s base and aligning with its supporters’ interests and pressing concerns. Great campaign songs are also effective at capturing the vision and policies of the presidential candidates. No one should be surprised that Beyoncé let Harris use “Freedom.” From day one, she has been intentional about using her artistry to advocate for women’s empowerment, sisterhood, community, Black culture and freedom. As a member of Destiny’s Child, her quicksilver and resolute vocals adorned such chart-toppers as “Bills, Bills, Bills,” “Independent Women, Pt. 1” and “Survivor,” articulating the ideals of modern Black women through an infectious, contemporary mix of R&B, pop and hip-hop grooves.On introspective, experimental full-length albums such as 2013’s world-stopping “Beyoncé,” 2016’s culture-defining song cycle “Lemonade,” and her celebratory 2022 love letter to LGBTQ+ culture’s roots in dance music, “Renaissance,” Beyoncé refined her sound and messages to reflect the social zeitgeist as well as her evolution as a woman and cultural observer. Using “Freedom” to amp up excitement for campaign is a sign that Harris understands Beyoncé’s influence on the culture and that her campaign recognizes Beyoncé as a generational icon with a wide appeal among younger demographics. Harris has long devoted her time to addressing the issues facing younger generations, especially younger women. From implementing solutions to help millions curb their crippling student loan debt to stressing the importance of upholding the protections of Roe v. Wade, she is campaigning on a promise to defend the interests and protect the rights and well-being of young people. She has to know what’s at stake if young people aren’t motivated to vote.According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the turnout of young voters ages 18 to 29 saw a significant boost in the 2020 election, rising almost 12 percentage points from 2016. In 2020, 55% of registered voters in this age group cast their ballots, marking the largest turnout in this demographic since 1972. Even so, the fact remains that older voters turn out at the highest rates. In the 2020 election, 74% of voters ages 65 and older participated. There’s been an ongoing debate over whether Harris can effectively win over Gen-Z and younger millennial voters. Megan Thee Stallion performed at her large rally in Atlanta, and celebrities including Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Olivia Rodrigo, Barbra Streisand and Lizzo have expressed support for either Harris or her policies. Some have argued that this embrace of memes, celebrity endorsements and Gen-Z jargon is not enough. By itself, it isn’t. At least it shouldn’t be. Harris still needs to earn the votes of this country’s youngest voters. But she can’t do that without grabbing their attention, and relying on celebrities who support her is not a bad way of doing that.Harris is also fortunate to be the kind candidate and to have the kind of platform that the world’s best musicians want to be associated with. Add to that many artists’ distaste for her opponent. A long list of musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Adele have objected to Trump using their work to promote his campaign. When the former president’s campaign played a video of Celine Dion performing “My Heart Will Go On” at a rally in Montana this month, her team responded, “In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use… And really, THAT song?” Last week, Isaac Hayes Enterprises (the estate of the late musician) announced that it is suing Trump and his campaign for “134 counts [of] copyright infringement for the unauthorized use of the song ‘Hold On I’m Coming’ at campaign rallies from 2022-2024.” Hayes co-wrote the song, which was most famously performed by Sam & Dave.(The Associated Press reports that in 2022, David Porter, another co-writer, wrote “Hell to the NO!” after learning that Trump had used “Hold On, I’m Coming” at an NRA rally. Sam Moore (one half of Sam & Dave) performed “America the Beautiful” at a pre-inauguration concert Trump held in 2017.) But Beyoncé has given Harris the freedom to use one of her most powerful songs. “Freedom, freedom, where are you? / ‘Cause I need freedom, too,” Beyoncé sings. In playing that song, Harris is signaling why her supporters must vote."
34,I understand why Harris delayed her high-stakes interview. It was still a mistake.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 14:49:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-cnn-interview-rcna168867,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 29 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Vice President Kamala Harris’ first interview as a presidential nominee is set to air on Thursday. Harris will be joined by her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. The interview comes after the vice president faced intense criticism for not formally sitting down with the media since entering the presidential race.  The political operative in me gets what Harris is doing. She’s spending her time on the campaign trail, making her case to voters. Why not push off the first big interview for as long as you can? On the other hand, as a citizen — and as someone who loves journalism and believes in transparency — I can acknowledge it’s not the best look. I’m not saying she has to do these huge prime-time interviews with well-known anchors but, why not sit down for an interview with a local journalist? She’s traveling around the country, hitting swing states — she should take advantage of that. If she’s on the road in Georgia, this is the perfect opportunity to sit down with a journalist there.  Harris has to show the American people she’s accessible and she can think on her feet. This is just an unforced error on her campaign’s part. It makes her look like she is too protected, too hesitant. Certainly, Harris can give an interview — after all, she’s the vice president of the United States."
35,Harris sends letter to HBCU students as her college voter push continues,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 13:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-hbcu-letter-election-rcna168874,"Ahead of a planned college campus tour in battleground states, Vice President Kamala Harris penned a letter to students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on Wednesday, encouraging them to vote and laying out the stakes of this year’s elections.  The Democratic presidential nominee released her letter as an ad through Watch The Yard, which publishes content related to Black colleges and universities, Black Greek organizations and the Black collegiate experience. An HBCU graduate in her own right, the vice president has spent a lot of time on college campuses mobilizing voters over the last few years. In September 2023, she went on a “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” to promote reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ equality and freedom from book bans. She also appeared on ESPN during a bowl game for her alma mater, Howard University, last winter to tout the value of HBCUs. And she was back at Howard earlier this month hyping up students. The bonds she built with college voters then seem to have sowed the seeds for the surge in young voter support she’s seen as Democrats’ presidential nominee. So it follows that Harris and her team are making even more concerted efforts to get college students to the polls. They recently announced a “back to school"" campaign to engage young voters across 150 campuses in battleground states. Her letter to HBCU students this week is more proof of how crucial the Harris-Walz campaign thinks young, college-going voters will be to their election bid this fall. In the letter, Harris said her time at Howard had a “profound impact” on her and said HBCUs are where Black youths are “constantly reminded you are young, gifted, and Black.” She said college is “when I started to become politically engaged” and where she “learned that progress in our country happens when young people fight for it.” Harris said college students’ record turnout in 2020 is the reason she’s vice president today, and she declared “fundamental freedoms” are at stake this election, citing voting rights, marriage equality and bodily autonomy under threat from anti-abortion lawmakers.  “Your vote has never mattered more,” she wrote. “I know that when young people fight for progress, it changes the course of our nation. I believe in you. I am inspired by you. And I am rooting for you.” Both the Harris campaign and its allies, and the Trump campaign and its allies, are taking diverging approaches to college voters this year. While Harris and Trump both speak about the need for young voters to turn out, Trump, tellingly, is the only candidate in the race whose allies have openly promoted efforts to make it harder for college students to vote."
36,Vance: Harris can 'go to hell' for criticisms of Trump campaign over Arlington incident,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 10:18:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-kamala-harris-go-to-hell-trump-arlington-rcna168765,"Sen. JD Vance has defended the Trump campaign over an altercation with an Arlington National Cemetery staff member, instead criticizing Kamala Harris over the controversy and telling an audience she ""can go to hell."" In remarks at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Vance cited the deaths of 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, blaming the vice president for not having investigated the withdrawal or firing anyone. “Sometimes mistakes happen — that’s just the nature of government, the nature of military service. But to have those 13 Americans lose their lives and not fire a single person is disgraceful,” he said. “Kamala Harris is disgraceful.” “She wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up?” he added. “She can — she can go to hell.” Vance's comments are not just disrespectful — although they follow the example that Trump has maintained throughout his political career — they're also inaccurate. As The Washington Post pointed out, the criticism from the Harris' campaign spokesperson was merely to call the incident “pretty sad” but “not surprising coming from the Trump team” on CNN on Wednesday, and Harris herself has not said anything about it in public. Even as Vance has bristled at the criticism, accusing the Harris campaign of “trying to make a massive political issue” out of the incident and blaming the media for having “turned it into a national news story,” the Trump campaign's own indignant response to the incident has kept the story in the headlines. Rather than admitting it had defied federal laws that bar political activity at gravesites in Arlington, the campaign released a video that included the grave of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a combat veteran who died in 2020, without his family's permission. Marckesano's sister told The New York Times that the Trump campaign did not adhere to visitation rules, saying, ""We hope those visiting this sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected accordingly."" In addition to the scandal of politicking at the cemetery, a Trump aide pushed a cemetery employee out of the way so that the campaign could take photos and video, NBC News reported Wednesday, citing two Defense Department officials. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the employee a “liar” in response. What's more, Cheung and Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita have disparaged the employee in deeply personal terms, suggesting she had a “mental health episode.” The employee initially filed an incident report with military officials but later declined to press charges, fearing retaliation from Trump supporters, according to the Times."
37,Trump’s online tantrum targets Harris with crude sexual remark,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 07:42:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-tantrum-kamala-harris-crude-sexual-remark-election-2024-rcna168793,"Even those who’ve grown accustomed to Donald Trump’s tantrums were taken aback by his latest online antics. An Associated Press report summarized: The former president’s timing could’ve been better. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released a new ad this week that argued, among other things, that Trump would seek revenge against his perceived foes in a prospective second term. It was against that backdrop that the Republican nominee used his social media platform to promote: But in case that wasn’t quite enough, a New York Times report highlighted what was arguably the most offensive item in the GOP candidate’s avalanche of ugly nonsense. The Times’ report added that the “repost was the second time in 10 days that the former president shared content from his personal account making sexually oriented attacks on Ms. Harris. Though he has a history of making crass insults about his opponents, the reposts signal Mr. Trump’s willingness to continue to shatter longstanding norms of political speech.” It’s worth emphasizing that in each of these instances, it wasn’t Trump who personally created the offensive online content. But that hardly makes the circumstances any better: The former president apparently saw these ugly messages and deemed them worthy of amplifying to his vast online audience. What’s more, his willingness to target Harris with a crude sexual remark dovetails with related rhetoric Fox News host Jesse Watters, who told viewers this week that the Democratic nominee, if elected, will “get paralyzed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her.” One of his co-hosts at the time, Jeanine Pirro, urged him to ""take it back."" (Watters denied that his remark was intended to suggest “anything of a sexual nature.”) Trump boasted this week that he’d be “great for women” if voters return him to the White House. There’s fresh evidence to the contrary."
38,Why Kamala Harris' DNC will be different,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-17 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-democratic-convention-different-rcna166960,"I spent the day in Chicago on Thursday at the United Center, where the Democratic National Convention will be held next week. And while there will still be lots of speeches and plenty of balloons, I can already tell the event is going to feel different from past conventions. Here are three examples: This November, Arizona voters will decide on a constitutional amendment known as Proposition 139 that would ensure abortion care access up until fetal viability, or around the 24th week of pregnancy. And the proposition already has a lot of support within the state. Over 577,000 signatures were collected to put it on the ballot, the most ever for an Arizona initiative. According to a CBS poll from May, 65% of likely Arizona voters already say they support abortion being kept legal in all or most cases. Proposition 139 could also have a big impact on voter turnout. As Donald Trump brags about overturning Roe, this initiative has the potential to energize Democratic voters, with consequences for the presidential race as well as Arizona’s pivotal Senate contest between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake. Moore has been a powerhouse in Democratic politics for decades. She served as the director of White House political affairs under President Bill Clinton, was a key adviser to Biden during the historic Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, and played a pivotal role in securing Harris’ spot on Biden’s 2020 ticket. Now, Moore is taking on another critical role: managing this year’s Democratic National Convention in her hometown. A Chicago native, Moore got her start in politics as an organizer for the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign. She later became a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. As chair of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Moore brings decades of experience and deep roots. My sit-down interview with her will air this Sunday. Best known for her role as Kate Harper, deputy national security advisor on “The West Wing,” Mary McCormack is an accomplished actor, producer and dedicated social justice advocate. Recently, she co-authored the book “What’s Next,” which she describes as “a love letter to The West Wing, the people behind it, and the fans who cherished it.” We’re thrilled to have her join us on the show this Sunday, alongside Martin Sheen. What show are you bingeing right now? “Veep” on HBO. What’s the last book you read? “Devil in White City” by Eric Larsen. What time do you wake up on the weekends?

39,Kamala Harris isn’t just listening to workers. She’s sounding like them.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 07:50:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-walz-campaign-workers-movements-rcna166623,"With its rallies that pack arenas, Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has harnessed an energy that many have compared to Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Polls in battleground states indicate that the dynamics of the presidential race have fundamentally shifted, but skeptics question if the good vibes can last once the vice president starts to detail policy. Is this burst of excitement, they ask, just the momentary enthusiasm of voters surprised by an unexpected transition? When we pay attention to what Harris and Walz have already said, though, it’s clear they have tapped the energy of worker-driven movements that want to create an economy that works for all of us. The good vibes and the economic vision of this campaign are, in fact, deeply connected. A case in point: The concluding line in Harris’ stump speech last week was echoed by cheering crowds in arenas across the nation. “When we fight, we win!” For those of us who have been supporting low-wage worker movements over the past decade, the slogan is familiar. It’s been a standard rallying cry since McDonald’s workers first organized the Fight for 15 in 2013. Since then, it has been used by service worker unions who have organized everyone from Waffle House servers to Dollar General clerks, Amazon warehouse workers, and graduate student workers on university campuses. “When we fight, we win!” as a slogan gives voice to the frustrations of the 135 million poor and low-income Americans who know that, even when they work two and three low-wage jobs, it’s impossible to get ahead. Not in an economy that has tilted to more explicitly favor billionaires over the past half-century. But “When we fight, we win!” also expresses the agency of working people who’ve stood up to their bosses and their anti-union culture in so-called “right to work” states like North Carolina to assert their power and win better wages and working conditions. Here in North Carolina, where Harris is expected to roll out her economic agenda today, we mobilized the same agency through “Moral Mondays,” which, like the McDonald’s workers’ fight, also began in 2013. When we hear Harris say, “We’re not going back!” we hear an echo of our movement’s cry: “Forward together, not one step back!” Based in Durham, the Union of Southern Service Workers has worked in recent years to unite a coalition of low-wage workers who have often been pitted against one another along racial and ideological lines. Black, white and brown workers have challenged the politics of division while also refusing the typical framing of left versus right and liberal versus conservative. There’s nothing “far left” or radical, they insist, about the people deemed “essential” during the pandemic insisting that they should earn enough from a week’s work to take care of themselves and their families. Despite the Senate’s refusal to raise the minimum wage during the Biden administration, the direct action of low-wage worker unions has helped lift 13 million Americans out of low-wage jobs over just the past two years. Service worker unions have harnessed the anger and disappointment that drive so many low-income Americans away from politics, but these workers aren’t just driven by feelings. As they have organized, they have also made proposals about practical changes that could make a difference in their lives. Harris and Walz have already demonstrated that they are listening to organized labor. In Detroit, they met with the United Auto Workers at their union hall and thanked their president, Shawn Fain, who had been on television the weekend before lobbying Harris to choose Walz as her running mate. The UAW understood him to be the most pro-union among her finalists. In Las Vegas, Harris promised to champion a proposed tax exemption for tips alongside her fight to raise the federal minimum wage. On Tuesday, Walz spoke to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and pledged that a Harris-Walz administration would expand the pro-worker policies he has enacted in Minnesota to every state. Republican candidate Donald Trump, who tries to frame his divisive populism as “pro-worker,” claimed Harris stole the “no tax for tips” idea from him. But the concept, which has been developed as a policy proposal by Nevada’s two Democratic senators, originated with the Culinary Workers Union 226. Other tipped workers have advocated for One Fair Wage and won campaigns at the state level to eliminate subminimum wages for tipped workers. The details of policy matter, for sure, but this much is clear: The Harris-Walz campaign is listening to workers as it crafts its economic agenda. And it is already speaking the language of workers movements. In our work to organize poor and low-income Americans through the Poor People’s Campaign, we’ve seen how politicians who embrace the language of fusion movements for economic justice have the power to both tap into the moral concerns that drive millions of Americans and multiply the energy of grassroots organizing. In our new book “White Poverty,” we use data from the past three decades of U.S. elections to argue that infrequent, eligible low-income voters represent the largest potential swing vote in 2024. As we witness the groundswell of enthusiasm for the Harris-Walz ticket, we see more than good vibes. This is a campaign that has already tapped into the hopes of working people who, for decades, haven’t had a fair shot and is promising an agenda that could inspire them to show up for races down the ticket. We look forward to hearing the details, but we can already celebrate what low-income people across the nation see: A worker’s vision for the economy is already at the heart of this campaign."
40,Trump likes to act tough. Harris is proving her strength.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-tough-guy-act-crime-immigration-rcna166804,"Donald Trump is obsessed with toughness. He praises foreign despots for being strong, calls for police to be rough with suspects and uses blue-collar workers as props at his rallies. But Trump’s tough-guy persona is an act, and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is calling him out on it. Her campaign and its allies are leaning into Harris’ background as a prosecutor, her advocacy in the Senate and her time as vice president to tout her strength. And they’re contrasting this with Trump’s empty rhetoric and record of failure to show that she’s actually the stronger, tougher candidate. Nowhere is this fight more clear than on immigration. During a rambling and glitch-delayed conversation with billionaire Elon Musk this week, Trump leaned into his usual attacks, falsely accusing Harris of serving as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” For starters, that was never her title — and I should know, since I was working for her at the time. I served as Harris’ chief spokesperson when the president asked her to lead diplomatic efforts to tackle the “root causes” of migration. The vice president led these talks with our partners in Mexico and Central America, focusing on new strategies to expand economic opportunities in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. So, who is stronger: the candidate who complains about border crossings before, during and after his presidency or the one who looks to figure out why they’re happening and work with foreign leaders to address the issue? But her record goes even further back. In a Harris-Walz campaign ad titled “Tougher,” a narrator lists her record as a border-state prosecutor. Harris held drug cartels accountable and jailed transnational gang members. The campaign ad also highlights her support for a bipartisan deal deemed the “toughest border control bill in decades.” The ad ends by declaring: “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” Voters should know the truth: Trump’s weaknesses as a leader are part of the reason why Harris can play offense here. Trump sank a conservative-led border deal in hopes it would help him during the presidential election. He prioritizes fearmongering over welcoming tough solutions to fix our nation’s broken immigration system. Another major issue for the “toughness” question is crime, and again, Harris comes out on top. As the vice president has been saying on the campaign trail: As a former prosecutor, she knows Trump’s type. Her campaign has used that experience to frame her as tough on crime and highlight Trump’s own criminal record. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of an elaborate scheme to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. By contrast, Harris is a seasoned prosecutor who convinced juries to convict fraudsters. While Trump works to distort Harris’ record on crime, his supporters embrace his criminality. At his rallies, the MAGA faithful hold up signs with his mug shot with the words “Never Surrender.” Trump also vows to pardon criminals who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The so-called party of law and order wants these violent criminals to run free. Which of these two candidates is tough on crime? Candidates also prove their strength by how they choose to campaign. Sometimes it is about what you show voters, not what you tell them. Trump is holding fewer events this campaign, spending his time on late-night social media attacks and whining about how unfair everything is. Harris is vigorously barnstorming swing states and focusing on voters’ concerns. During her short time at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has managed to define herself before Trump and other Republicans have landed on an effective countermessage. This battle to control the narrative is playing out before one of Harris’ biggest opportunities to sell herself to the American people: next week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Democrats can use this moment in the spotlight to drill down on the stark differences between a Harris presidency and a second Trump term. It is also an opportunity to elevate Harris’ proven track record and counter Trump’s playbook of lies and half-truths. The next 80 days won’t be easy. But I’ve seen the vice president in action, and I believe she’s tough enough to handle them. She is meeting the moment and prepared for the task at hand. After all, running for president is tough — and so is Kamala Harris.

41,Trump flunks basic science yet again in speech insulting Harris' intelligence,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 12:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-north-carolina-speech-smart-rcna166779,"Donald Trump promised an “intellectual” speech during his campaign stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. True to form, Trump broke his vow. Instead, what rallygoers got were some mind-numbingly misinformed ramblings from a septuagenarian nominee. Over the last several weeks, Trump has lobbed all kinds of puerile insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, attempting to undermine her intelligence. During this very speech, which Trump claimed would focus on the economy, Trump claimed Harris is “not smart.” But it's hard to take such insults seriously when Trump himself fails to grasp some fairly basic concepts involving science and economics. For example, he went on a rant arguing that Harris wants to “abolish oil, coal and natural gas,” and he suggested people who use wind power can't use their electronics when it’s not windy. In reality, the vice president is currently serving in an administration that has overseen a record boom in domestic oil production. And wind turbines are capable of storing power, so people who rely on them do not need to experience some ""Wizard of Oz""-level wind storm to use their appliances and gadgets. But this is not the scenario Trump envisioned in his speech: Trump has long demonstrated his ignorance of and aversion to wind power and other climate-conscious policies. During another rant against wind power back in 2019, Trump admitted he “never understood wind.” Evidently, he still doesn’t. That this confusion comes from a man who’s called climate change a “hoax” and repeatedly claimed that the primary consequence of rising sea levels will be more beachfront property doesn’t inspire confidence in his capacity to confront the issues of climate change or encourage an expansion of renewable energy.  Trump also admitted on Wednesday that he doesn't know what “net zero” means, referring to “Kamala’s extreme high-cost energy policy known as net zero.” But then he took it further: In reality, many people — all over the world — are familiar with the term (but if you're not, “net zero” refers to the point at which the amount of greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount being removed from the atmosphere). In fact, there are even quick, eye-catching videos online that explain the concept in simple terms for people like Trump who don’t know what it means. So much for science. On the economics front, Trump demonstrated his grasp of the subject by holding up a large package of Tic Tac mints next to a smaller one and saying, “This is inflation.” He didn’t elaborate. He went on to talk about how inflation, which has actually been slowing as of late, is destroying our country. How the existence of different size packages of mints connects to inflation was left for the audience to guess at.  Trump is the leader of an entire political party, with staff and advisers who could help fill in the gaps in his knowledge, to educate him and his followers. But Trump seems perfectly content to wallow in ignorance — and to pull the MAGA faithful into the misinformed muck with him."
42,Harris — like Trump — wants to stop taxing tips. That’s a bad idea.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 12:09:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-economic-plan-leave-one-ill-advised-strategy-rcna166782,"In the three weeks (yes, it has only been that long) since she became a candidate for the White House, Kamala Harris’ campaign has proven remarkably skilled and successful. Which is why it was strange to see Harris make what might have been the first major mistake of her campaign: Adopting one of Donald Trump’s new policy positions, ending federal taxation of income from tips.  Like many tax proposals, ending taxation on tips has an intuitive appeal — until you consider its true implications. So the Harris campaign made a misstep in two ways: Appearing to parrot Trump, and doing so in the service of a bad idea.  The proposal has all the earmarks of something Trump heard somewhere, tested out before a crowd, and when it got a round of applause, decided it would become an official position of his candidacy. It’s unlikely he put more than a few moments of thought into it, let alone considered all the pros and cons. But there is a version of it in Congress, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. One of its biggest problems is that it doesn’t contain safeguards preventing the wealthy from shifting their income into something they’ll call “tips,” thereby enabling them to avoid paying taxes.  The Harris campaign says her proposal — which, like Trump’s, hasn’t yet been laid out in detail — “comes with an income limit and with strict requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of the policy.” It would apply only to service workers in industries such as retail and hotels. Which is why both candidates have promoted the idea in Nevada, a swing state where a large number of workers are employed in the hospitality industry.  Nevertheless, Trump’s promise didn’t exactly transform the race; the powerful Culinary Workers Union in Nevada, which along with its parent union UNITE HERE has endorsed Harris, wasn’t impressed by his proposal. “Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” one top official said.  As tax proposals go, this one is limited in its effects: An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows that of the approximately 4 million Americans who rely on tips, more than a third already make too little to owe any federal income taxes. But if Harris really wants to start a salutary discussion about tipping, she could propose eliminating the practice entirely, or at least scaling it back. We’ve all noticed how tipping has spread like wildfire; it seems like almost every purchase you make is now accompanied by a request for a tip, even when you received nothing resembling “service” at all. More importantly, tipping is a practice that has deeply racist roots; as an Economic Policy Institute report notes, “Following the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, formerly enslaved Black workers were often relegated to service jobs (e.g., food service workers and railroad porters). However, instead of paying Black workers any wage at all, employers suggested that guests offer Black workers a small tip for their services.”  Today, while the minimum wage hasn’t been raised from $7.25 an hour in 15 years, employers are allowed to pay tipped workers a minimum of just $2.13 — and that latter figure has remained the same for 33 years. The law says that if their tips don’t bring their total income up to $7.25, then employers are supposed to pay them the difference, but they don’t always do so, one of many forms wage theft takes. That’s just one kind of exploitation tipped workers are subjected to; millions of female servers have to grin and bear constant sexual harassment from customers, because their income is dependent on not angering the guy who just made an offensive remark or put his hands on their body. One survey found 70% of female servers saying they had experienced sexual harassment.  But if tipping is going to be with us at least for now, wouldn’t exempting tips from taxes still give a hand to low-wage workers? Perhaps some, but it would come with unintended consequences. For instance, lower income subjected to taxes today would mean lower benefits for those workers when they retire. As Berkeley economist Sylvia Allegretto notes, “Tips that are not taxed will not be credited towards the time and amount that workers are putting towards their Social Security.” So they would end up gaining very little if anything out of the deal. Lowering taxed income would also reduce the amount some workers would receive through the Earned Income Tax Credit.  There’s also a fundamental principle guiding proposals like this one that progressives should push against at every opportunity: that some kinds of income deserve to be treated better by the tax system than other kinds. Why should a person earning $25,000 a year in tips waiting tables at a diner not pay taxes, while a person earning the same $25,000 at a fast-food restaurant next door should? “As a general rule, you want to treat all income the same,” says Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “You don’t want to give people an incentive to game the tax code. This is one reason (in addition to giving a lot of money to rich people) that most on the left hate the carried interest deduction. We allow some of the richest people in the country to have much or most of their wage income to be taxed at the capital gains rate.” Just as we shouldn’t tax investment income at a lower rate than the income people get from working, it violates progressives’ belief in equality to say certain kinds of work should be exempt from taxes while other kinds shouldn’t.  Vice President Harris will be releasing her economic plan soon, and we should hope that it contains proposals that will make a difference to more Americans. Those could include increasing both the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage (or better yet, eliminating the distinction entirely), restoring the increased Child Tax Credit that was in place during the pandemic, and strengthening the ability of workers to form unions. All that would be much more meaningful than a proposal that amounts to little more than a gimmick. After all, if Trump thinks it’s a good idea, we should all be suspicious."
43,Why Harris’ polls performance might be more than a ‘honeymoon’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/election-2024-trump-harris-swing-states-poll-numbers-rcna166610,"Since she catapulted to the top of the Democrats’ ticket last month, Vice President Kamala Harris has been quickly closing the gap with former President Donald Trump in polls. After President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, it was looking like Democrats would be routed. Harris has essentially made it a tied race again. The big question, though, is whether her campaign’s momentum can be sustained till November and, crucially, if it translates into votes in the states that will decide the election. There’s reason for Democrats to be hopeful. A New York Times/Siena College poll released this week shows major gains from Harris in three key swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. According to the survey, Harris now leads Trump in those states by 4 percentage points — 50% to 46% — among likely voters. That is within the margin of error for all three states, but those numbers are significant given Biden’s deficit last month. We’re seeing the same thing happen in three other swing states. In Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, Harris is either leading or tied with Trump, according to a survey released this week by The Cook Political Report. Things are also swinging Harris’ way in the national polls, according to an aggregate from FiveThirtyEight. A recent Substack article from Nate Silver highlighted how much of a shift this has been compared to last month, with Harris climbing almost 12 points in Arizona polls. (For the record, NBC News hasn’t released a national survey since Biden dropped out, but in its most recent poll conducted in July, in a then-hypothetical question about what voters might do if Biden discontinued his campaign, Harris was running behind Trump, 47% to 45%, with a margin of error of 3.46%.) It remains true that polls don’t tell the whole story and that there’s a risk in Democrats’ thinking that Harris has Trump cornered. Among those reportedly trying to tamp down the enthusiasm is Trump’s top pollster, Tony Fabrizio, as his boss has started to fret about Harris’ surge. “Mr. Fabrizio has predicted to campaign colleagues that Ms. Harris will have another two to three good weeks, through the Democratic National Convention, and then her poll numbers will turn in the other direction,” The New York Times reports. There’s a solid bit of wisdom baked into Fabrizio’s claims that can’t be dismissed as pure cope. It’s been well documented that a post-convention polling bounce exists, one that often provides a greater benefit for the candidate whose party goes second. Notably, the effect has dwindled over the years, as polarization has hardened voters’ partisan preferences. And as with all things election-related, there’s plenty that can happen between the nomination and Election Day that could send polls spiraling topsy-turvy again. But here’s the thing: We don’t have to take the most recent polling in isolation. Instead, we can compare the latest NYT/Siena results to a poll that the partners conducted last year, when Biden was still in the running and underwater in those key states. In October, Trump led Biden among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup by 5 points in Michigan and 6 points in Pennsylvania, while Biden had a 2-point advantage in Wisconsin. When asked about whether they would support an unnamed Democratic candidate over Trump, things shifted. Trump lost that imaginary contest in each state: 48%-41% in Michigan, 50%-40% in Pennsylvania and 51% to 39% in Wisconsin. That tracked with more recent polling that found that Biden was running behind other Democrats before exiting the race, failing to catch up with Trump even as other candidates’ numbers showed the strength of the party’s messaging. Biden supporters rightly noted then that it’s much easier to support a generic candidate than a real politician with actual positions and a record to critique. Importantly, though, the October NYT/Siena survey also polled respondents about a hypothetical matchup between Trump and Harris. At the time, Harris trailed Trump in those three states by 1 to 3 percentage points. This direct comparison suggests a continuity at work here. It wasn’t a given that Harris would find herself performing as well as or better than the generic Democrat voters were asked about in last year’s survey. For her to have taken the lead among likely voters in those swing states demonstrates that there’s more at work here than mere relief that Biden is out. Her numbers also undercut the assumption that Harris is enjoying an unsustainable boost after replacing Biden. Instead, as NBC News recently reported, her campaign is doing the work to ensure that this surge in enthusiasm is being converted into a veritable army of volunteers. The presidential race is still probably going to be a close one, in which a handful of states decide the victor. It’s much more likely to be a roller coaster between now and November. But there’s little reason to assume Harris’ current momentum owes to a “honeymoon” period that will wane long before the election, not when the polls showed so clearly that voters were seeking someone other than Biden to take on Trump."
44,Donald Trump's anti-worker rhetoric could help Kamala Harris win the White House,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-14 13:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-musk-harris-walz-union-workers-rcna166617,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight.” On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held his first solo campaign event since joining the Democratic ticket. Walz addressed one of the country’s largest public sector unions, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  For years now, unions have been big fans of Walz. As governor of Minnesota, he banned noncompete agreements and guaranteed paid sick days for workers. He made it so companies can’t force workers to attend meetings where they argue against unionizing. The guy has even joined picket lines. The reason I bring all of this up is because it stands in sharp contrast to how the other side of this race thinks about labor.  On Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sat for a livestreamed interview with the billionaire owner of Tesla and the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk. In the past few years alone, Musk has fired nearly 80% of Twitter’s workforce. He’s also been found liable in court for illegally firing a Tesla worker who was trying to form a union.  During his conversation with Musk, Trump offered his take on those job cuts, calling Musk “the greatest cutter.” “I mean, I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t mention the name of the company — but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK, you’re all gone.’” On Tuesday, the United Auto Workers union filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk for that statement. The group’s president put out a statement that said, bluntly, “When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean.” The United Auto Workers has already endorsed Harris. With their backing — and the backing of other labor organizations like the UAW — the Harris-Walz campaign may just be able to buttress the ""blue wall"" and win in November.

45,The familiar trap Kamala Harris needs to avoid to defeat Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-14 12:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-avoid-democrats-trap-donald-trump-rcna166590,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" No one should confuse the enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for a lack of substance.  Harris knows her stuff. She knows where this country needs to go. I’m sure her campaign will lay out detailed policy positions very soon. Those policies will be posted to her website, for the American people to research and think about for themselves.  But Harris needs to be careful here. As a former Democratic senator, I know all too well the trap members of my party sometimes fall into. Democrats think, well, if I can just give one more detail about how we’re going to convert green energy into jobs or if I could just give the voters one more in-the-weeds factoid then that will do it. However, that approach will not appeal to the people who will decide who takes the White House. These people are not high-information voters. Many of the voters who will actually decide this election likely won’t pay attention until the final 60 days of the campaign. So while Harris has to have that substance ready to go, she also needs to keep her campaign where it is now in terms of messaging — “We’re not going back. We’re going forward. This is about you and it’s not about him.” That is what will likely convince the voters that Harris needs to win the White House in November.

46,Is the Harris-Walz campaign making political merch great again?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-14 11:04:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-camo-hat-rcna166260,"During the 2016 election, I recall sitting on the beach with friends in a Jersey Shore town that was split down the middle between Republicans and Democrats. Someone told a joke: “How can you spot a Trump supporter?” The punchline: “Because they’ll show you.” The person was referring, of course, to the bright red ""Make America Great Again"" baseball hat that had just made political and cultural landfall. Today, the accessory is as ubiquitous as ever. While fashion has long been a medium to express personal ideology, political or otherwise, the MAGA hat ushered in something different. What may have begun as merely political support for a presidential candidate became a salient symbol of exclusion, divisiveness and an invitation for heated debate. There is no single item that is more of a political and cultural juggernaut than the MAGA hat. But now it could have a challenger. A $40 camouflage baseball hat baring HARRIS WALZ in orange, boldfaced print sold out in 30 minutes last week. As of Thursday, sales reportedly totaled nearly $2 million including pre-order sales. I’m sure that number has since grown. Singer Bon Iver wore one to perform at a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I saw at least one on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. For certain Americans in liberal enclaves across the country, the cap is already a status symbol. Not to evoke Harris’ most viral moment to date, but the camo hat exists in a cultural context, joining a trend that is already seeing an incredible upswing. While camouflage never truly exits the general fashion milieu, it’s enjoying a real moment. This is especially true for men’s fashion, so-called Carhartt-core, in its embrace of ‘90s-era military trends and a subversion of traditionally masculine pieces that perpetually exist outside of high-end fashion. (Look at any TikTok fluent Angeleno or Bushwick transplant for some combination of white ribbed tank top, oversized well-worn jacket, and heavy, silver chain jewelry.) This aesthetic, camouflage baseball cap included, originated as practical and durable workwear for blue-collar Americans — a voting bloc that has been steadily leaving the Democratic Party since at least 2012. Walz’s place in the Harris campaign is clear: He is to be that Midwest everyman, that average-above-average working-class guy. And by, all accounts, he genuinely is. Walz even wore a black T-shirt, sneakers and, yes, a camouflage baseball cap, in the campaign video commemorating his place as a Harris’ vice presidential pick. The choice has sparked a lot of notable reactions. Meghan McCain, daughter of the late politician John McCain, seemed to read it as a grab for working-class voters, posting on X: “Putting someone in a camo hat doesn’t make them a moderate or appealing to red-state people. No one is that dumb.” That statement can be picked apart in another article, but it’s worth noting that even if McCain’s jaded assessment of the cap were entirely true, it still is an embrace of “red-state people,” as she calls them. That alone separates it from the inherent exclusivity of the MAGA hat. Then there’s Chappell Roan. The Missouri-born 26-year-old singer has emerged as the breakout star of the summer. Chappell Roan, already a cultural, fashion and LGBTQ+ icon in her own right, famously rejected an invitation to the White House to perform for a Pride celebration, citing her belief in “freedom in trans rights, that means freedom in women’s rights, and it especially means freedom for all oppressed people in occupied territories.” The official merch for her “Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess Tour”: a camouflage baseball with hat orange, boldfaced embroidered letters spelling “Midwest Princess.” In an alternate reality, in a timeline where the Harris-Walz campaign hadn’t already proven to be extraordinarily meme-literate and internet savvy, perhaps this camo baseball hat would merely be a bid to appeal to those lost working-class voters and a true celebration of Walz’s Midwestern background. We aren’t in that timeline. On the one hand, this hat is confirmation that the Harris-Walz campaign understands the social currency of trends and the power of virality. On the other, it signals, yet again, that the campaign is dedicated to appealing to the sprawling Gen-Z voting bloc. Many a political pundit and research poll have emphasized the power these young voters have to shape the election, and Harris is clearly listening. This is the second time in the month since Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee that she has embraced a powerful, young and zeitgeist-y singer. It’s naïve to believe that effective use of campaign merch is enough to win Gen-Z voters, long painted as fickle and disillusioned, the first generation of ostensibly liberal-leaning voters that won’t vote blue just for the sake of voting blue. Or that a trendy fashion statement will entice the votes of so-called red state people. But the hats are still selling. And they remain a powerful symbol for the reach and cultural impact of the Harris-Walz campaign in ways we can’t ignore."
47,Kamala Harris' new ad is a pitch-perfect response to Donald Trump's attacks,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-13 13:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-immigration-record-donald-trump-rcna166421,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Vice President Kamala Harris is going on the offense, and touting what she sees as her tough immigration record in a new campaign ad. Since she entered the race, Republicans have attacked Harris over the issue, falsely labeling her as the administration’s “border czar.” This ad is exactly what the vice president should be doing: You go in on the issue that your opponent thinks is your weakness and make it your strength. It’s something Harris has done effectively on the campaign trail already. And it’s something that I suspect she’ll do effectively at the debate next month.  It’s very simple and the facts speak for themselves here. In July, border crossings were lower than during Donald Trump’s last month in the White House. There’s also the border bill backed by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma — the most conservative immigration bill in decades. While Harris supported that deal, Trump stopped it — ordering House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson to kill the bill.  He did so because the bill would not only be good for those on the border who are concerned about illegal immigration, but also because it would be good news politically for President Joe Biden. The ad was an effective way for Harris’ campaign to hit back against Trump and Republicans’ misinformation on her immigration record. We’ll see how it plays with voters in the coming weeks."
48,"Why pro-Palestinian protesters are going after Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 14:02:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-gaza-israel-protests-obama-dreamers-rcna166006,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight,” guest hosted by Ali Velshi. The last time Democrats sought to hold onto the White House after four years in power was in 2012, when then-President Barack Obama was running against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Romney was not the most conservative candidate in the Republican Party, even back then. But he had staked out an aggressive hard-right position on the issue of immigration, running on a platform of “self-deportation” — making life so hard for immigrants in this country that they have no choice but to leave. Given that, it probably surprised a lot of people that young undocumented immigrants had chosen to spend their time and energy protesting … President Obama. They held mass demonstrations outside the White House where many were arrested. They showed up at his campaign offices in California, carrying signs that read, “Obama stop deporting Dreamers.” Protesters even held a hunger strike sit-in at Obama’s campaign offices in the then-swing state of Colorado. At issue were protections for Dreamers, people who were brought to this country without legal authorization as children, many of whom had lived in the U.S. almost their entire lives. Obama supported protections for those Dreamers, but he insisted that he could not grant them those protections alone. He said the Republican-controlled Congress would have to send him a bill. But then, in June of 2012, right in the middle of the campaign, something remarkable happened: Obama came around and decided to try. He announced that he would grant protection to thousands of Dreamers through executive order.  The pressure worked and Obama was re-elected with strong support from the Latino community, despite the protests. However, much to the chagrin of the Obama administration, the protests didn’t stop. Many of those Dreamers were now protected, but there were still some who weren’t. And the parents of those Dreamers could still be deported at any moment. So those activists kept pushing, even interrupting the president during speaking events. Obama, again, insisted that he did not have the power to take those actions alone. But activists kept the pressure on. The following year, Obama moved again, using another executive order to shield even more Dreamers from deportation and deprioritize the deportation of people without criminal records. There were plenty of people at the time who questioned the strategy of those protesters, who asked why they weren’t protesting Romney and the Republicans in Congress who were blocking progress on immigration reform; but those protesters understood a key part of how social movements work. They understood that sometimes in order to make real change you have to target the people who are moveable, the people who want you in their coalition, the people who actually care. That is both the burden and the beauty of what it means to be part of a functioning, big-tent political party that's responsive to social change — to be on the side of what the late Rep. John Lewis called “good trouble.” On Wednesday, at a rally in Detroit, Vice President Kamala Harris was interrupted by a group of demonstrators protesting the war in Gaza. After their second interruption, Harris shut down the protesters, telling them, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” That’s a snappy line that makes for a good soundbite and it’s undeniably true that she will be a better president for their cause than Donald Trump. But, as those immigration protesters proved back in the Obama administration, these issues are more complicated than “we’re better for you than the other guys.” Harris has already proven she is the kind of thoughtful leader who listens and that she understands the nuance of this particular issue, even while some continue to insist that neither nuance nor context matters on this story. Her campaign presents a real opportunity to reset the relationship with the varied communities expressing dissatisfaction over this war, and America’s role in it. But will the Harris campaign use this as an opportunity to listen? And can those protesters use this as an opportunity to be heard?

49,"On Harris’ racial identity, Trump apparently can’t help himself",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 09:43:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-racial-identity-trump-apparently-cant-help-rcna165982,"Donald Trump spent much of last week taking aim at Kamala Harris’ racial identity — up to and including the Republican promoting messages related to the Democrat’s birth certificate. The tactics were as racist as they were familiar: Axios described the effort as “Trump’s new birtherism.” Earlier this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who became a sycophantic ally, appeared on Fox News and suggested the party steer clear of comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage ... is a good day for her and a bad day for us,” the South Carolina Republican said. Putting aside the fact that it’s a bad sign when a senator has to publicly appeal to his party’s presidential nominee to be less racist, Graham’s advice appeared sensible. Even Trump’s allies struggled to explain why, exactly, the GOP nominee was investing so much energy into targeting Harris on racial grounds. The former president nevertheless ignored Graham’s recommendation. The New Republic highlighted one of the more memorable exchanges from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago news conference: When a reporter, referencing one of Trump’s comments from last week, specifically asked the former president how it is that Harris only recently decided to be Black, the GOP nominee replied, “You’ll have to ask her that question because she’s the one that said it. I didn’t say it.” As part of the same exchange, Trump went on to argue: “From her standpoint, I think it’s very disrespectful to both, really. Whether it’s Indian or Black, I think it’s very disrespectful to both.” So, a few things. First, the idea that he “didn’t say” that Harris recently decided to be Black is the opposite of the truth. Appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention last week, Trump said — out loud, on the record and on camera — “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Is she Indian, or is she Black?” Second, the idea that a biracial person is being “disrespectful” by honoring their mother’s and father’s heritage is every bit as offensive as it seems. Finally, spare a thought for the Trump sycophants who’ve tried and failed to defend the former president’s fixation on Harris’ race — Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, I’m looking in your direction — only to have the GOP nominee casually stroll back into the racist trap of his own making."
50,Packed Harris-Walz campaign rallies likely to rattle crowd-size-obsessed Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 13:51:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/trump-vance-harris-walz-crowd-size-rcna165823,"This is an adapted excerpt of the Aug. 8 episode of ""Morning Joe."" The recent attacks from Republicans targeting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military career are just a small part of a much larger theme within the Trump-Vance campaign — a campaign that feasts on dishonesty and disinformation.  They do that to deflect from a record where the cruelty, the violence, the antidemocratic values, the disrespect for our Constitution is the entire point. That’s who they are and that’s what they want to distract from. And to do so, they are trying to tear two very positive, joyful and energetic people down.  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are riding a high right now. Their best strategy is just to keep moving forward and deflect the disinformation that comes their way. But they also need to embrace the joy — which you see them doing.  Just look at the crowds they’re attracting. There has been a burst of energy and enthusiasm. You have people waiting out in the hot sun for hours. When you have to move a rally to an airport hangar, and that’s not even big enough, you’re onto something. Harris isn’t on a roll just with her vice presidential pick, it’s her entire campaign. We know Donald Trump depends on crowd size for his own sense of value. We saw that from his very first event as president, his inauguration, where he had to lie about it. Clearly crowd size is very important to the former president, so what we’re seeing from Harris and Walz will, no doubt, be very scary to the Trump campaign moving forward. And it doesn’t look like their crowds will be getting smaller anytime soon."
51,Harris found a pitch-perfect response to the 'lock him up' chants at her rallies,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 12:27:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-lock-him-up-chants-rallies-rcna165822,"Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have adopted a smart strategy for handling her followers’ (rather ironic) calls for Donald Trump to be incarcerated.  At Harris’ rallies, her supporters have occasionally broken out into chants of “lock him up” when she references the various criminal proceedings against the former president. The chant seems to combine the irony of using the phrase popularized at Trump's rallies against the candidate who pushed false claims of criminality against Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, together with an expression of a very real desire to see Trump held accountable for his actions. But you may have noticed that Harris, a former prosecutor, has never encouraged the chant. Instead, she’s waited for it to die down before going on with her speech.  I suspect she’s done this primarily out of respect for the administration of justice. Even if she does happen to want to see Trump get prison time as a result of being found guilty on 34 felony counts, it wouldn’t be smart — politically or legally — for her to say so. And I suspect she doesn’t want her followers to appear as rabid as Trump’s, despite their conviction that he should go to prison over his criminal conviction.  So I’ve been impressed with how she's responded to these chants by reiterating that her campaign is about more than defeating Trump. “This campaign — our campaign — is not just a fight against Donald Trump,” she said at her rally in Philadelphia this week. “Our campaign — this campaign — is a fight for the future.” Harris put a different twist on that message when the “lock him up” chants broke out during her stump speeches in Wisconsin and Detroit on Wednesday, saying in both speeches, “The courts are going to handle that” and “We’re going to beat him in November.”  It’s a clever play, really. It places Harris above the fray but doesn’t diminish her followers’ energy. And it speaks to voters who may want something to motivate them this November other than accountability for Trump and his illiberalism. "

Even conservatives have been talking about Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz’s rally on Tuesday, remarking how well those two did — and the vibrancy of it all. It’s hope, optimism and joy versus the promise of retribution, anger, bitterness and division. And if you look at the candidates’ schedules, it’s also the active versus the inert. You have Harris flying out of Washington on Wednesday and heading to Wisconsin, doing an event there and then going straight to Detroit. Her schedule is busy morning, noon and night.  Here’s how Donald Trump laid out his schedule for Wednesday: “I will be interviewed tomorrow morning at 7:30 A.M. on Fox & Friends. Much to talk about. ENJOY!” The truth is, whenever Trump does go out he damages his campaign. His campaign has been very straightforward and honest about that. They want to hide him. They want to keep him from going out and talking because we see what happens when he does.  He went to Georgia and basically created a political civil war inside the Georgia Republican Party — making devastating comments, not only about Gov. Brian Kemp, but the governor’s wife, which again, is the last thing he needed to do. It’s clear this is going to be a campaign of contrast."
53,Trump picks a nickname for Harris that no one seems to understand,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 12:12:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-nickname-kamala-harris-kamabla-no-one-understands-rcna165602,"It was late Monday when Donald Trump first referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Kamabla” on his social media platform. Soon after, the former president repeated the nickname. A day later, the Republican wrote it again. And then again. And then again. And then again. At this point, readers might be asking, “What in the world does ‘Kamabla’ actually mean?” That’s certainly a common question this week, and no one seems to know the answer. That includes Team Trump surrogates. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Gov. Doug Burgum last night, “This is something I’m personally curious about. ... Do you know where [‘Kamabla’] came from, and what that nickname means?” The North Dakota Republican replied, “I can’t comment on that.” On Wednesday afternoon, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, was asked the same question. The Ohio Republican chuckled, but he didn’t answer the question. The mystery, in other words, lingers. I’ve seen a wide variety of guesses — the idea that this might be some kind of Three Dog Night reference is especially amusing — and it’s certainly possible that Trump didn’t even mean to call her “Kamabla,” but once he did, he decided to lean into the typo. But there’s also a larger context to all of this. As a New York Times report summarized: This is compelling, and coming up with a weird, gibberish-like nickname might very well have something to do with the GOP nominee’s desire to define Harris as The Other. But the whole point of derisive nicknames is to convey an obvious criticism. When Trump called Sen. Marco Rubio “Little Marco,” the phrase was intended to diminish the Floridian’s stature. When he called Sen. Ted Cruz “Lying Ted,” Trump was trying to draw attention to the Texan’s dishonesty. The meaning and purpose of the nicknames were self-evident. No one thought to wonder why in the world Trump was using these lines. The fact that the former president’s own surrogates can’t explain his sudden fixation on “Kamabla” is a timely reminder of a politician who clearly no longer has his fastball."

Knowing she would be running against the clock, with a very compressed campaign schedule, Harris quickly jumped into action. In the first week, she reached out to party leaders and raised a lot of money very quickly. Then came the much tougher — and significant — task of picking a running mate. A good running mate should strengthen a ticket’s chances in key states, help win over a certain block of voters and share a policy agenda with their presidential nominee. By picking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris has opted for compatibility and a more left-leaning policy agenda. But I know for a fact that a lot of moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents are less than thrilled about it. Immediately after the Walz announcement, my phone exploded with friends, family and colleagues all saying basically the same thing: ""I was excited about Harris, and I’m still going to vote for her, but only as a vote against Trump."" In other words, this choice may not push anti-Trumpers back into the MAGA fold, but it is very disappointing. Some of the sparkle and promise is now gone. During the last couple of weeks there was a palpable buzz among moderates especially. Biden stepped down, Harris stepped up, and both Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were being floated as possible running mates. Shapiro, has been working with a Republican-controlled state Senate to get things done in Pennsylvania, and Kelly most recently supported bipartisan immigration reform legislation, an issue he has publicly disagree with his own party on. What was so appealing to moderates about these men is that they are consensus-builders; they have worked with Republicans and picking either of them would prove that Harris wasn’t going to be the progressive candidate that they feared. Polling strongly suggests that most people do not vote for a president based on their vice presidential pick. However, this decision does give voters a glimpse of what kind of leader the candidate would be if elected, and how they might govern. As governor, Walz has successfully pushed a progressive legislative agenda in his home state, and this agenda will now be used by Republicans to frame Harris as a “San Francisco Liberal.” Among the issues that Republicans will certainly try to exploit are Walz’s push to allow undocumented migrants to be eligible for driver licenses, his restoration of voting rights for felons and his passage of tough climate change regulations. A glowing endorsement from Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez will not help matters with swing voters. Although, to be fair, moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin also supports the choice. I was a senior adviser to The Lincoln Project and oversaw the day-to-day operations of Republicans and Independents for Biden. This coalition, along with other like-minded organizations, helped persuade moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents to vote for Biden, which in turn helped Biden over the finish line in 2020. So I know a fair amount about how to appeal to the sort of Republican who is desperately seeking a Trump alternative. By putting Walz on the ticket, it appears that the Harris campaign is betting that the people who voted for Trump in 2016, then flipped and voted for Biden in 2020, will either grimace and vote for Harris anyway, or just sit this election out. (And this may very well be true.) It also shows that Team Harris must still be at least a little worried about the liberal base, especially the “uncommitted” voters turned off by Biden’s support for Israel. It is likely that after the Democratic National Convention in a couple of weeks, we won’t see or hear much about Gov. Walz. It is also likely that Walz will not cause the headaches that Ohio Sen. JD Vance is already inflicting on the Trump ticket. Still, Walz is far from the bold choice that swing voters were looking for. We had hoped for better."

Frank Carillo, 66, is charged with one count of making threats against the vice president of the United States, according to the U.S. attorney’s office of the Western District of Virginia. He made his first court appearance Monday after being arrested at his Winchester home. A public defender listed in court records for Carillo did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. According to the criminal complaint, Carillo mentioned the vice president 19 times on Gettr, a right-wing social media platform, with several of the posts containing graphic descriptions of violence. Authorities said Carillo also posted violent threats against President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Phoenix-area elections official Stephen Richer — a Republican who has pushed back on election denialism. Carillo’s online posts were flagged by Richer’s Maricopa County office on July 27, and FBI agents then discovered more than 4,300 posts or replies on Gettr in which Carillo targeted public officials, according to the complaint. He also allegedly made posts threatening to kill undocumented immigrants and Muslims. Federal agents seized an AR-15 rifle, a 9 mm handgun and thousands of rounds of ammunition at Carillo’s home last week, the U.S. attorney’s office said. Violent threats against public officials have been on the rise in recent years. There were appeals for the temperature in politics to be lowered after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last month — including from the GOP presidential nominee himself — but there has been arguably little substantive change."

The GOP presidential nominee shared a cryptic post on his social media platform, Truth Social, shortly after Harris announced her pick that simply stated: ""THANK YOU!"" The typically reactionary Trump waited another roughly five hours to directly address the news: ""This is the most Radical Left duo in American history,"" the former president posted on Truth Social. ""There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again."" He went on in his 40-word missive to baselessly suggest that there is a ""BIG MOVEMENT"" to ""BRING BACK CROOKED JOE,"" an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, who withdrew his re-election bid last month amid pressure from top Democrats and donors. Trump followed that up with a longer exploration of his apparent fantasy that Biden will try to ""take back the Nomination"" when he attends the Democratic National Convention next week. ""He feels he made a historically tragic mistake by handing over the U.S. Presidency, a COUP, to the people in the World he hates most, and he wants it back, NOW!!!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. Though it seems clear Trump would rather face Biden in November, there's no indication the president is seeking to undermine Harris, whom Biden endorsed upon dropping out of the race and who formally secured the Democratic nomination on Monday. So far, Republicans appear to be struggling to come up with a cohesive line of attack against Walz, with some desperately taking shots at Walz because he created a Beyoncé Day last year ahead of her Renaissance Tour stop in Minneapolis. Others have accused the Democratic Party of being antisemitic because Harris, whose husband is Jewish, passed over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. ""No Jews allowed at the top of the Democratic Party,"" conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted on Tuesday, to which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, replied: ""News to me."" Trump will surely adopt a few talking points against Walz as the campaign goes on, but that his initial reaction was void of Walz-focused barbs and centered instead on an imagined scenario about Biden making a comeback is eyebrow-raising and, well, kind of ... weird."

With her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she has teed up another prospective “first”: If the Harris-Walz ticket wins the White House, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the country’s first Native American woman to be governor. A member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, Flanagan was elected lieutenant governor in 2018 after serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives. She and Walz easily won re-election in 2022. Flanagan, 44, is the nation’s highest-ranking Native woman elected to executive office, according to her official biography. As laid out in the Minnesota Constitution, Flanagan would assume the governorship if the Democratic ticket were to win the White House, or if Walz steps down to campaign (he has not indicated that he would). On Tuesday, Flanagan congratulated Walz for becoming Harris’ running mate, writing on X: As lieutenant governor, Flanagan has been a leading voice in Minnesota for Indigenous rights. She formed the state’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office and has helped shore up relations between the state government and Minnesota’s tribal nations. Flanagan is also an outspoken advocate for abortion rights. Last month, after Iowa enacted a six-week abortion ban, she toured a Minnesota abortion clinic and welcomed out-of-state patients seeking help. “If you’re afraid, come to Minnesota,” Flanagan said. “We’ve got you.”"

Here's what to know about Harris' running mate: Born in West Point, Nebraska, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He graduated from Chadron State College in 1989. With his wife, Gwen, he moved in 1996 to Mankato, Minnesota, where he taught in a public school for more than a decade before entering politics. He also has a master's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato. Walz is the first vice presidential candidate on a Democratic ticket since 1964 who did not attend law school. Walz took up temporary teaching gigs in China and on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota before landing at Mankato West High School, where he taught geography and coached football for more than a decade. In the mid-'90s, he became the faculty adviser to the school's first gay-straight alliance — a role that Jacob Reitan, Mankato West's first openly gay student, told The Washington Post was crucial. “He set an example not just for LGTBQ students but for football players in the locker room at a time where gay people were not well understood,” Reitan said, adding that it was a sign of Walz's ability to “sell seemingly progressive ideas to seemingly not progressive crowds.” Walz was first elected to represent Minnesota's 1st Congressional District in the House in 2006, a seat he was re-elected to five times. Walz ran and won his last election for the district in 2016, the same year Donald Trump swept it by 15 points. Minnesota Democrats, fresh off gaining control of the state Legislature after the 2022 midterm elections, had a historically productive legislative session. With Walz as governor, they secured free school lunches and free college tuition for some families, codified abortion rights, enacted stricter gun violence prevention laws, expanded protections for transgender youth and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people. The Star Tribune described the 2023 session as ""one of the most consequential sessions in state history."" In the early years of his congressional career, Walz, an avid hunter, had been one of the increasingly few Democrats who received an A rating from the National Rifle Association. He began to change his tune on gun rights after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. As a candidate for Minnesota governor, he pushed for an assault weapons ban in the state and said he would no longer accept money from the NRA. Walz faced some criticism at the time, both from gun rights activists and from Democrats who questioned why he had changed his stance only while running for governor. He has credited his then-17-year-old daughter, Hope, for the shift, saying that she urged him to do more to stop gun violence after Parkland. Walz is not a national figure, but his TV appearances in the past few weeks have significantly boosted his name recognition and bolstered his case to be Harris' running mate. His interviews on cable news helped underscore his relatability and his skill as a communicator, and they endeared him to many Democrats. His most effective attack on Republicans so far? ""These guys are just weird!"""
59,"Like Kamala Harris, my name has been mispronounced my whole life. Here’s how I reclaimed it.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 09:11:00,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/kamala-harris-name-mispronounced-whole-life-s-reclaimed-rcna165347,"My first and last names have been mispronounced my whole life. By friends, work colleagues, and even emcees announcing me as an event’s keynote speaker to rooms of thousands. I entered my own book launch event with a huge sign outside that had both my names misspelled.  As someone of Indian-Singaporean descent and a semi-public figure, any time I’ve introduced myself to a Western audience, I’ve cringed. I know that mispronunciation and awkwardness are par for the course. I can imagine, with all of my being, what it must be like for Vice President Kamala Harris — the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — whose name has been deliberately mispronounced by her opponents in an effort to denigrate her candidacy.  And now, just to make things more complicated, I’ve decided to publicly change my last name.  I’ve made a career of creating a sense of belonging through intention, stories and action. But I’ve been hiding a secret: my last name hasn’t provided me with a sense of familial or social foundation for a long time.  In a world that doesn’t easily allow women, women of color, and those who are not public figures to change our minds, I am doing what I have said I’d never do as a feminist.  I’m changing my last name to “Malhotra” to match that of my husband and my son.  The reasons are complicated, and some of them I’m choosing to keep private. “Tulshyan” doesn’t resonate with me because it reminds me of the fraud and deceit of the man I inherited it from — my estranged father.  I didn’t make this decision lightly.  Like many professional, straight women who marry or who have become estranged from one or all members of their family of origin, I’ve wrung my hands thinking through the feminist implications of changing my name after establishing a public identity. After years of agonizing about how to distance myself from a name that’s never quite fit — literally as podcast, upon article, upon blog post published with that very last name — the decision became crystal clear as I finished the last chapter of my next book, “Uncompete: Dismantling a Competition Mindset to Unlock Liberation, Opportunity, and Peace.” In it, I write: “In order to create a world that’s better than we found it, our decisions must be guided by the legacy we want to leave. As Jonas Salk reminds us to ask: ‘Are we being good ancestors?’”  The good ancestor I’m striving to be for my 8-year-old son makes it urgent that we have the same last name. Simultaneously, I am grieving leaving my old name behind because of the bond of love I do have with the people who I once shared it with: my mother and siblings. I’ve also been reflecting on Kamala Harris, whose first name — an Indian one that means lotus — has been deliberately mispronounced time and time again, including by her colleagues at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago. Linguistics professor Darin Flynn writes that conservative media personality Tucker Carlson’s mispronunciation of Kamala is “a textbook example of a linguistic process called ‘hyperforeignization,’ where speakers go out of their way to refit foreign-looking words with pseudo-foreign speech sounds and sound patterns.” Of course, I know this too well, having experienced it firsthand in every school, college, workplace and social setting I’ve been in. As a former journalist and the author of two books with a third on the way, my name is more Google-able than average and harder to pronounce than average. Despite the accomplishments tied to it, I am changing it because I deserve a name that feels authentic to who I am and who I want to be, regardless of who it may inconvenience.  Names can help us stand out. They can help us fit in. Mine have only done the former, and just as people started to recognize my name, I’m changing it.  Our surnames often tell the world about our identity, offering clues about who we are, where we are from, our cultural background, and our family lineage. Our names reveal where we are in the human tapestry of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and — for better or worse — our families. I’ve talked about how pronouncing names correctly is a key foundation to being inclusive and anti-racist. The most commented section of a course I teach about inclusion is one where I talk openly about the shame I felt growing up with an unusual name and the path to reclaiming it. In short: I know that names really, really, really matter. Forcing people of color to change their names to be more “Western” has been part of the assimilation playbook since colonial times. Christian colonial missionaries in India, Africa and other parts of the world forced those they oppressed to change their names to become “less heathen.” The horrors of the residential boarding schools where American Indian and First Nation children were forcibly taken from their parents and coerced to “fit in,” including by adopting Western names, are well-documented.  The tradition to take on our father’s names is deeply Western and patriarchal, stemming from the 15th century when wives were considered property. Not until the 1970s did many states make it easier for a woman to keep her pre-married last name. Contrast this with other traditions, including the Khasi tribe in India, where children take their mother’s clan’s last name and women inherit land. Fluidity is common in the naming traditions of many Native American tribes, where children are given names according to their personalities. Their names can change throughout their lives to reflect their evolving identities and life circumstances. We all become more free when we think beyond the binary forced upon us and choose names that empower us. Changing my name to Malhotra feels most reflective of me, not least because of my identity as a mother of color.  My husband is a feminist and a loving role model for who I want my son to become. His name deserves to live on, more than my own father’s does. While the younger me thought it was anti-feminist to take it on, I now realize how the choice to decide either way — even if it may cause confusion — is a hard-earned privilege. If feminism is truly about choices, then this will be mine. It is a choice rooted in legacy, rather than accommodating white America with a more palatable-sounding name. That choice is something many people never experience, especially women from immigrant families. If feminism is about agency, then I’ll be honest. I wish I had more than just two choices when it comes to my last name. Western society doesn’t make it easy to build and maintain a legacy within its constraints. Having to choose only between my father’s or my husband’s name for the sake of being more easily categorized feels deeply patriarchal and unfair. I’m grateful for the support and conversations with my mother, sister and women friends. Some are instantly-identifiable authors and speakers, including some who changed their names. Each woman affirmed that I should focus on how my name made me feel and the legacy I hope to create for my son, rather than business or professional considerations.  As I work through this private struggle in public, I hope it will allow more people, particularly those like me with uncommon names, to make more authentic choices.  When I was introduced by my new name in a recent TV interview about Kamala Harris’ candidacy, it felt surreal — like they were talking about someone else.  But when I later watched the replay with my son, he pointed excitedly at the screen exclaiming, “Mum! You’re a Malhotra! Like me!”  And at that moment, it felt just right."
60,Don’t believe the naysayers — Tim Walz is an asset to the Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 08:47:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/tim-walz-kamala-harris-moderate-progressive-pick-2024-rcna165354,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate. And I, for one, think it’s a great pick. Republicans are already pushing back on Walz — trying to paint the governor as some far-left progressive. But that's just not the case. In reality, Walz grounds the vice president in a way that will really matter to voters, especially those not on the coasts. When Walz served in the House, he was elected in a very moderate district. There are many parts of Minnesota where it's not easy to get elected as a Democrat, and he represented one of them. He is much more moderate than people are giving him credit for. Although some believed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was the more moderate choice for the Democratic ticket, I challenge folks to find issues where Shapiro and Walz have major disagreements. Walz is not a coastal elite guy. He’s not an Ivy Leaguer. This is a guy who says things like, “You’d lose your hair, too, if you supervise a high school lunchroom for 20 years.” This is a guy who can give you advice on how to fix your car. He's a guy who served more than two decades in the National Guard. Tim Walz is a man who has served his country admirably. And he's going to be a real asset to the Harris campaign. What I think made the difference here is Walz's way of communicating. He is joyful when he’s on the attack. He almost does it with a wink and a smile. He has a sense of humor when he is going after these guys. And that’s what Harris needs.  She needs somebody who will keep the lightness in her campaign, somebody who will be a happy warrior — and that’s Tim Walz. He is one happy warrior, and I think he’s a terrific pick.

61,Time will tell if Kamala Harris made the right choice by picking Tim Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 07:46:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-running-mate-pick-history-rcna164961,"Vice President Kamala Harris just made her most important decision as a presidential candidate so far: the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. The choice gave the electorate its first glimpse of her judgment on the most important matters. Typically, presidential candidates pick running mates who address a weakness or build a bridge to the wing of their party alienated by their nomination. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower selected Richard Nixon, then seen as a pugnacious conservative, after he beat the right’s hero — Ohio Sen. Robert Taft — for the Republican nomination. In 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy, from Massachusetts, chose Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, from Texas, to give his ticket geographic balance. In 1968, Nixon settled on little-known Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew, because he was not objectionable to either the liberal or the conservative wing of his party. One Nixon aide remarked that if they had programmed a computer to produce a “Vice President who would do least harm to party unity,” it would have selected Agnew. Many more prominent possibilities would have enraged one wing of the GOP or the other. As a sign of how much more rudimentary (or nonexistent) vice presidential vetting was in the pre-Watergate era, Agnew would later resign in disgrace over kickbacks he had taken as governor. As voters started to warm to outsider candidates — usually governors with zero ties to Washington — vice presidential nominees became a way to build bridges to the political establishment and add an adviser with Washington experience. That was the case when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter selected Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale (who also provided geographic balance) to join his ticket in 1976. In 1980, after negotiations to put former President Gerald Ford on his ticket failed at the last minute, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan buried the hatchet and selected his strongest primary opponent, George H.W. Bush. The choice was an olive branch to the moderate wing of the party, which had serious concerns about Reagan. Eight years later, Bush did the inverse. Conservatives had long harbored doubts that he wasn’t really one of them, so he went with the boldest choice on his short list and selected Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, a young conservative up and comer, as his No. 2. Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton discarded the common formula in 1992 when he selected Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, a fellow Southern moderate, as his ticket mate. But the 46-year-old Clinton was running on generational change against the 68-year-old Bush. And the 44-year-old Gore fit with this theme. Eight years later, Gore also discarded the standard playbook for selecting a running mate in the hopes of distancing himself from Clinton’s personal scandals. He chose the devout Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — the first Jewish vice presidential nominee. The senator had been the first Democrat on the national stage to condemn Clinton for his peccadilloes. Gore anticipated that Lieberman’s rectitude would help appeal to voters who liked Clinton’s governance and policies, but cringed at his personal behavior, as well as blunt Republican attacks over Clinton’s character. Outsider nominees looked for something else beyond D.C. connections and governing experience when trying to balance their tickets: foreign policy credentials. That was a main reason George W. Bush selected former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to be Lieberman’s opposite in 2000. Similarly, Barack Obama, who had only spent four years in the Senate, chose Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden to run with him in 2008. There is one unmistakable pattern in the history: the worst vice presidential selections have the biggest impact. There are three glaring examples. First, third-party candidate George Wallace selected retired Gen. Curtis LeMay to be his running mate in 1968. Among LeMay’s blunders: ignoring the counsel of Wallace’s staff not to discuss nuclear weapons at his introductory press conference. Instead, he declared that Americans had a “phobia” about using them even though “there are many times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons.” A few weeks later, LeMay told an audience, “There are many cases when abortion is proper.” The question, according to the general, should be left up to “the people concerned and the physicians.” He simply had no political judgment. The abortion position alienated blue-collar Northern Catholics who were essential to Wallace’s bid. The LeMay disaster was one of the main reasons that Wallace’s support dropped off significantly in the final weeks of the campaign. Four years later, South Dakota Sen. George McGovern captured the Democratic nomination by taking advantage of a new selection process that placed much greater emphasis on primaries. Yet he was an insurgent, and he didn’t have the nomination locked down until the delegates to the Democratic National Convention reversed a decision by the Credentials Committee that had stripped McGovern of some of California’s delegates. With McGovern’s staff preoccupied with the intraparty battle, they didn’t focus on choosing a running mate until the last minute. The McGovern camp, especially the candidate himself, assumed that he could eventually prevail upon his top choice — Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy — to accept the vice presidential slot. When that proved impossible, McGovern’s staff undertook a chaotic and haphazard process with an impending deadline. After several other preferred choices declined offers to join McGovern’s ticket, and Kennedy demurred again, the South Dakotan selected Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton with fairly minimal vetting. That decision erupted on McGovern when it came out that Eagleton had received shock therapy for depression on multiple occasions in the 1960s. Eighteen days after McGovern selected Eagleton, he was forced to withdraw from the ticket. In 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain needed a bold move to reset the trajectory of the campaign. He rolled the dice on little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — the first female ever on the Republican ticket. In some ways, the selection worked brilliantly: Palin became a conservative rock star, enthusing the GOP base, which was ambivalent — or worse — about McCain. But Palin’s lack of knowledge of world affairs and clear lack of capacity to run the country did damage, in large part because McCain was 72 years old, at the time considered old for the presidency. The elder Bush’s choice of Quayle in 1988 wasn’t a blunder on quite the same level. Yet the rollout of his selection was exceedingly rocky, in part due to questions over whether Quayle’s wealthy family used connections to get the senator into the National Guard during the Vietnam War. He also produced one of the more infamous debate moments in history, and his weakness prompted future President George W. Bush to counsel his father to dump Quayle from the ticket in 1992 in favor of his defense secretary: Dick Cheney. The senior Bush didn’t take that advice and lost to Clinton. What does all of this mean for Harris? The next three months will tell us whether her staff properly vetted Walz, whether choosing him was advantageous politically, or whether she made a blunder for the ages. We’ll find out soon enough."
62,"Harris taps Tim Walz, the one Democrat who checked every box",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 06:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-taps-tim-walz-democrat-running-mate-ticket-election-2024-rcna165339,"By all accounts, as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowed her search for a running mate, the Democrat had six finalists in mind. They were, in alphabetical order, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Each had an impressive resume, and each would bring real value to the party’s 2024 ticket. Buttigieg, for example, is an incredible communicator. Kelly, meanwhile, is a decorated veteran. Shapiro and Pritzker were positioned to help the ticket in the nation’s most competitive region, while Beshear has demonstrated an ability to deliver a compelling Democratic message to rural and conservative voters. Of these five, some had experience in statewide office, some had experience in Congress, and some served in the military. But only one of the six finalists checked all of those boxes, combining all of the other candidates’ best qualities — and he’s the one who’ll stand alongside Harris. NBC News reported: As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted, “Harris’ choice of Walz as her running mate could broaden the ticket’s appeal: Harris as a Black, Asian woman from California with experience as a prosecutor, and Walz as a white, folksy Midwesterner with a record of enacting progressive policies.” I can imagine there are going to be a whole lot of voters nationwide who’ll respond to the news with the same question: “Tim who?” But it’s also safe to say that those who don’t yet know the governor are going to be impressed by his story. Walz enlisted in the National Guard as a teenager and served for more than two decades, including overseas deployments. He was a high school social studies teacher and football coach. When he ran for Congress, Walz was expected to struggle in a rural district that rarely voted Democratic, but he prevailed anyway and held the seat for 12 years. He then ran two successful gubernatorial campaigns and racked up some impressive progressive policy wins. As Clarissa-Jan’s report added, “Since 2022, when Democrats won control of the state Legislature, Walz has passed billions in funding for schools, including free school lunches; shored up abortion rights; secured stricter gun violence prevention laws; expanded legal protections for transgender youth; and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.” NBC News’ report went on to note that Walz also “enacted laws expanding paid family leave, banned most non-compete agreements ... and capped the price of insulin in Minnesota (three years before Biden did it nationally).” Not too shabby. But to appreciate why Harris tapped Walz for the Democratic ticket, it’s also important to emphasize just how impressive his audition has been. The entire party just went through an intense and compressed “mini-primary” process in which a bunch of would-be vice presidents engaged in public and private campaigns. As some of Walz’s MSNBC appearances helped prove, he stood out in impressive ways, earning raves from engaged and online audiences. As for the electoral implications, Democrats have expressed confidence of late that Walz will be a valuable asset throughout the Midwest. For his part, Trump recently insisted he’s “leading” in the North Star State and expects to win Minnesota “easily.” He should probably start lowering expectations drastically."
63,GOP insider: Trump’s anti-Harris messaging reflects a ‘nervous breakdown’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-nervous-breakdown-election-2024-rcna165324,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party spent two years preparing for one thing: a 2024 race against President Joe Biden. The GOP nominee and his team knew what they wanted to say, how they’d say it, when they’d say it and to whom they’d deliver the message. The former president would be an imperfect messenger who’d struggle to stay on-script, but Republicans at least had something resembling a plan. And then Biden passed the torch. To hear GOP officials and their allies tell it, they were prepared for a pivot. Those assurances weren’t true. Indeed, in the first week of the overhauled presidential race, Republicans — when they weren’t targeting Vice President Kamala Harris with racism and sexism — were reduced to focusing on her laugh, her affection for Venn diagrams and weird complaints about plastic straws. The second week was no better. One Fox News personality apparently thought it’d be a good idea to talk about the Democrat enjoying wine. Another spent some time focusing attention on Harris hugging people. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy whined, more than once, that the incumbent vice president didn’t call him during his congressional tenure to talk about his party’s non-existent policy agenda. It was difficult to imagine swing voters in battleground states hearing all of this and thinking, “Well in that case, Harris has lost my vote.” And then, of course, there’s the GOP nominee himself — who’s now referring to Harris as “Kamabla” for reasons I don’t understand — who spent much of last week questioning the vice president’s racial identity in deeply ugly ways. When that message didn’t resonate, Trump apparently decided to roll out yet another line of attack: As Politico reported, the Republican spent much of the weekend asking people to believe the vice president is an idiot. That wasn’t an exaggeration. In one online missive, the Republican nominee argued that Harris is “a LOW I.Q. INDIVIDUAL” who “can’t put two sentences together!!!” In another, Trump wrote that the vice president is “really DUMB,” “unable to speak properly without a Teleprompter” and has “an extremely Low IQ.” At this point, I could write a paragraph or two talking about how Harris is, in reality, smart. I could also add some sentences about how Mr. Let’s Inject Disinfectant Into People probably shouldn’t go around questioning others’ intellectual prowess. I could even take some time to note that if Trump genuinely believed that Harris is “dumb,” he wouldn’t be so terrified of sharing a debate stage with her. But there’s a larger point that’s also worth keeping in mind as the campaign advances: The former president is starting to look awfully desperate. Trump thought the race was effectively over after his debate with Biden, and now that the contest has changed, his anxiety about a possible defeat is pushing him toward panic. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” Election Day 2024 is three months away. Watch this space."
64,Why the Sept. 10 debate is shaping up to be a win-win for Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-debate-harris-kamala-sept-fox-rcna165178,"Former President Donald Trump is reportedly chickening out of the second presidential debate, insisting on a new date, setting and format that he thinks will favor him. But Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, plans to appear at the initially scheduled place and time — Sept. 10 on ABC — regardless of whether or not Trump shows. It’s a smart move that’ll help lay bare both Trump’s self-doubt, and his lack of interest in anything civic-minded that doesn’t help him. For months, Trump obsessed over the idea of a debate against President Joe Biden, framing his eagerness as “for the good of the country.” He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last year that he was ready to do “10 debates” with the president. In May, Biden’s and Trump’s campaigns agreed on the format for two presidential debates. And after Biden’s disastrous first debate performance, Trump didn’t express hesitation over the second debate scheduled for September and moderated by ABC News. But with Biden out of the race and with Harris set to replace him, Trump’s thinking has changed. He posted on Truth Social on Friday that the agreement he had made with Biden was “terminated” because “Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network …. thereby creating a conflict of interest.”  Neither excuse makes sense. Trump’s lawsuit against ABC — concerning anchor George Stephanopoulos’ saying Trump had been found “liable for rape” — was filed in March, weeks before he agreed to the ABC debate. And Trump and Biden didn’t just to agree to the debate because they thought it’d be a good time. They did so because they were considered de facto nominees for their parties. Now Harris is all but certain to be the nominee, so it only makes sense that she would take Biden’s place in the debate.  Indeed, Trump isn’t even pretending the debate is entirely off. He has instead proposed a new date and — more important — a new format. The debate, he says, should be held on Trump-worshipping turf at Fox News, and it should take place before a “full arena audience.”  Trump’s new debate terms give the game away. Now that he fears embarrassment against an energetic new candidate who can communicate far more effectively than her predecessor, he wants to rig the environment with moderators and audience members who are far more likely to make him look more competent, reasonable and well-liked than his opposition. This ploy tracks with Trump’s prior attitudes toward debates. While Trump was gunning for months for a debate with Biden, he refused to participate in a single debate in the Republican presidential primaries. Rather than participate for the “good of the country” or even just his party, he sought to delegitimize the Republican debates and even held events simultaneously to draw viewers away from them. His goal was clear: to sideline the opposition and turn the primaries into a coronation. And the result was equally clear: Trump showed disdain for the idea of public accountability and informing the public about his record or future policies. Trump’s threat to no-show the Sept. 10 debate makes Harris’ appearance that night a win-win scenario. If Trump doesn’t show up, she’ll get a sizable (albeit most likely more modest) prime-time audience and an opportunity to speak at length with the American people about her background, her policies and her vision of the future. Moreover, Trump’s non-appearance will generate countless headlines making him look cowardly. If, on the other hand, Trump reverses course and shows up, Harris will have an opportunity to showcase her policies and draw a contrast with her mendacious, rambling and authoritarian opponent. Trump will no longer benefit from going up against a candidate who was no longer fit for the debate stage. Regardless of how this shakes out, the entire back-and-forth works to Harris’ benefit. Trump looks afraid, and his desire to set up contests only where he thinks he can win is evident for all to see."
65,Kamala Harris is getting the thing Donald Trump always craves: attention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 15:04:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-donald-trump-games-attacks-attention-rcna165254,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 4 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Kamala Harris could announce her running mate at any moment, with the vice president set to reveal her pick ahead of their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday.  But the fact is, no matter whom she chooses, the announcement of this pick will only build even more momentum for the Harris campaign.  The vice president has already held a series of big, energizing rallies, like last week’s event in Atlanta featuring Megan Thee Stallion, where the rapper coined the phrase “Hotties for Harris.” She’s also brought on all-star campaign veterans like David Plouffe, Stephanie Cutter, Jennifer Palmieri and Mitch Stewart — adding to an already seasoned team.  The money continues to pour in at a crazy pace. The Harris campaign said this week they raised a record-breaking $310 million in July. She’s also up in the polls. Harris has a one-point edge nationally over Donald Trump, and the two are neck and neck across the collective battleground states, according to a new CBS News poll. Harris’ momentum is clear to anyone watching. What’s also clear is that all the attention on Harris is driving Trump kind of crazy — and he is twisting himself into a pretzel as a result.   At his rally on Saturday in Atlanta, Trump said some very strange things. Like when he congratulated President Vladimir Putin of all people for the historic prisoner swap that freed American citizens from Russia. He also repeatedly attacked Georgia’s very popular, very Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for not being sufficiently loyal. Despite their contentious past, and Kemp not supporting Trump in the primary, the governor was reportedly open to campaigning with the former president this fall. However, after Trump’s latest comments, that’s unlikely to happen. Like I said, he’s twisting himself into a strange pretzel. Earlier on Saturday, before sending his congratulations to a dictator and bashing a popular member of his own party, Trump made another self-sabotaging move — pulling out of a debate he already agreed to participate in.  Trump now says he won't attend the scheduled audience-less ABC News debate on Sept. 10. Instead, he proposed a debate on Fox News a week earlier with a full arena audience. Let’s pause on that for a moment: Trump’s saying he will not participate in a debate he already agreed to unless it turns into a MAGA rally with Fox moderators. Got it. Harris quickly called out the former president: “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space.’” As someone who’s worked on campaigns, I can tell you exactly what this is — this is what it looks like when one candidate has momentum and the other has no idea what to do about it. Here’s the thing: Harris will continue to own the spotlight for a while here. Her vice presidential pick is coming, she’ll hold rallies with her running mate all across battleground states next week, and a couple of weeks later, we’ll have the Democratic National Convention. And Trump is going to hate every second of that because he loves attention. As a result, he will get more and more outrageous and unhinged. That means we’re likely to see even more ugly, racist attacks like the one we saw from Trump in Chicago when he questioned the vice president’s racial identity.  But there is good news: Harris seems ready to respond to these attacks.  She told a crowd in Houston that Trump’s comments were just more of “the same old show,” and said the American people “deserve better.” “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us — they are an essential source of our strength,” Harris went on. That’s sort of the perfect response to all of this — to the racist attacks, to the unhinged rallies, to the games over debates: It’s the same old stuff, and America deserves better. Harris doesn’t make it about her. She makes it about the people they are running to represent. Not a bad message if you ask me.

66,I've run for public office. Kamala Harris is exactly the kind of candidate voters want.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 14:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-attacks-future-legacy-rcna165207,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""The Beat."" It’s hard for me not to get emotional about Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy. The American people are just starting to notice what an incredible, experienced and exciting leader she is. But for those of us who’ve followed her long career, that’s the Kamala Harris we’ve always known.  During her time as vice president, she has always been loyal to President Joe Biden. Even in the midst of all the panic over what was going to happen to the future of the Democratic Party and what was going to happen in this election cycle, she stayed loyal. However, as soon as Biden made his decision to leave the race and endorse his vice president, America finally had the chance to see the real Kamala Harris. For those of us who have had the privilege of seeking public office and asking for people’s trust, we know what voters want in return. They want to get to know you. They don’t want a presentation of what you think they may want — they want to know the real you. And that’s what Harris has shown to the American people. When she entered this race she came out as her full self. She came out powerfully and the people felt it. However, that doesn’t mean it’s been an easy few weeks for her. Harris has faced baseless attacks over her racial identity and qualifications.  This is someone who was a district attorney for a major city. Someone who was elected to a statewide office in California — the most populous state in the country. Someone who was elected to the U.S. Senate. And someone who is currently in the White House. There should be no debate over her qualifications. Her record speaks for itself. But these attacks against Harris are just an example of what we have to deal with — as Black women, as women of color, as women of any race — whenever we stand up and say, I can do this. Instead of having an honest discussion about ideas or qualifications, it devolves into personal attacks. And Harris has handled these baseless attacks masterfully. She’s been able to define herself without talking about herself. She's differentiated herself from Trump without calling him names. She's illustrated what kind of leader she is and will be if elected president. She's pointed at the future and told the American public this is what they deserve."
67,"In Kamala Harris’ California, ‘weird’ is the ultimate insult",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 14:27:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/weird-harris-trump-california-slang-rcna165232,"There’s been a lot of talk lately about Kamala Harris’ campaign’s effective use of the word “weird” to define Donald Trump and the Republican Party. It seems obvious to me this has gotten under the skin of both Trump and his running mate. Nonetheless, some people think it misses the mark. I think actor Wendell Pierce, for example, made a great argument that Democrats ought to call out right-wing racism and misogyny for what they are, rather than use a term that’s far more mild in comparison. Indeed, for someone with Trump’s history, “weird” can seem like a serious understatement. But at the same time, I’m a millennial raised on the West Coast and I know that the term has a slightly different connotation than some may associate with it, which I think speaks to its effectiveness. In Harris’ home state of California, for example, “weird” — for many young nonwhite people — doesn’t just mean quirky or unique, it’s used as an insult. That’s why there’s a genre of TikToks featuring young Californians talking about how being called “weird” — or its variant, “a weirdo” — is an offense that basically amounts to fighting words. Cali-based rapper YG’s song “Weird” explains — more crassly — the resonance the term has, while fellow California rapper Kendrick Lamar has used “weird” and “weirdo” on some of his diss tracks aimed at Drake, such as “Meet the Grahams” and “Not Like Us.” So, despite some understandable critique from fellow liberals, Harris and her campaign have settled on a term that appears to have cross-generational and cross-geographical appeal. “Weird” is a simple, straightforward term that voters of all ages can use, as my MSNBC colleague Ryan Teague Beckwith wrote, to describe Republicans whose “echo chambers and gerrymandered House districts” have led to ideas that are “increasingly extreme.” At the same time, the term is a familiar one to young voters of color — a constituency Harris will need to win in November."
68,College pics of Kamala Harris help highlight her Black Greek history,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 14:20:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-alpha-kappa-alpha-sorority-howard-rcna164185,"The mobilizing power of Black sororities has been in focus ever since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign last month. Harris, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. since her days at Howard University, has received rousing receptions at two major events for Black sororities in recent weeks, including the biennial convention for Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. and Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc.'s 60th biennial Boule. Any time Harris has pulled up to these events, her fellow Divine Nine sisters showed the palpable energy they — and Black Greeks broadly — stand to bring her campaign. For those familiar with Black Greek-letter organizations, there was never any question that members of these groups — which love to tout their esteemed legacies and pride themselves on their links to Black history — would broadly coalesce around Harris, as they did in 2020. I've noted several Black Greeks were speakers on the Win With Black Men organizing call for Harris last month. That call, which helped disprove a social media narrative about Black men being averse to voting for Harris, came on the heels of the previous night’s Win With Black Women call, which similarly featured multiple speakers from Black sororities. Both calls showed how Black Greeks and their networks can help mobilize Black folks around important political matters. And the possibility of electing the first AKA president — the first Black Greek president — is, as members of the org might say, a serious matter.   Late last month on “The ReidOut,” Joy Reid spoke with two of Harris’ line sisters (that is, women who pledged at the same time she did). After the clip aired, several viewers said they'd hoped to see some pics of the VP from her days on campus — or “on the yard,” as it’s often said. We'd included fairly recent photos of the VP and her line sisters in the segment, but we’re happy to share some throwbacks now that we have them! Check them out! And watch the clip of Joy's conversation with Harris' line sisters Monique Poydras and Lori Saddler below!"
69,I'm Black and Asian. Trump's attack on Kamala Harris was an attack on me.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 10:36:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-attack-kamala-harris-nabj-racist-xenophobia-rcna164871,"As a woman of color who has spent my whole life fighting bigotry, I didn’t think I could be more offended by the candidate running for president at the top of the Republican ticket. But then, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) made former President Donald Trump sit on a stage with three Black women journalists, where he illustrated the full extent of his racist xenophobia. Trump made many offensive remarks in that appearance Wednesday in Chicago; chief among the triggers for me was the way he questioned the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has now enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination and is soon expected to officially become the first Black woman and the first Indian woman to head a major party’s ticket. Trump said, “She was … of Indian heritage…until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He then asked ""Is she Indian or is she Black?” It’s incredible that in 2024, he asked that question — as if she couldn’t possibly be both. Harris’ background is well documented. Her father is a Black Jamaican. Her mother was Indian. Thirty-eight years ago, she graduated from Howard University, an HBCU, where she pledged the country’s oldest Black sorority. Trump remains trapped in the era in America in which people were expected to have a single racial identity. And, to be clear, that time was not so long ago. As recently as 1997, I left Jamaica as a woman of both Black and Asian heritage. I knew myself, without controversy, to be biracial. Then I arrived in the United States, where I was only Black. Suddenly, I found myself explaining my Chinese surname to white people who questioned me about it. If the conversation went further, then I had to make the case for identifying as both Black and Chinese. This reality was starkly different from my experience back home, where my Asian heritage was not in opposition to my Black heritage. In post-colonial Black Jamaica, being mixed carried some measure of privilege — it also came with some derision, but never, ever, denial. Everyone there accepted me as Black and Asian. In the United States, I was expected to be Black or Asian.  In a 2019 interview on “The Breakfast Club,” Harris said it herself: “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. I was born Black, I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.”  Trump has seized upon a video of her in the kitchen with the Indian American actress Mindy Kaling in which Harris enthusiastically affirms Kaling’s description of her as Indian and tells the actress, “You look like the entire one half of my family.” Kaling says, “I’ve been telling people we’re related already. This is perfect.” In a social media post, Trump says Harris “is saying she’s Indian, not Black. This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” Trump seeks to take the power of belonging to both Black and Indian cultures from Harris. He attempts to delegitimize her by insisting that belonging to both makes her some sort of traitor, somehow deviant, freakish, abnormal. Trump is tapping into a disturbingly pervasive American belief in a racial binary, that you’ve got to be one thing or another. Black folks all over the world know our community is of mixed-racial heritage. We understand that the one-drop rule, which says that anybody with one drop of Black blood is Black, is, at its core, reductive. That rule was meant to exclude Black people from the privileges afforded only to those possessing the visible quality of whiteness; being of mixed race often denied you a white heritage, but your Black racial identity was never contested. It was always yours to keep, perhaps because no one inside the racist patriarchy could imagine anyone else wanting it. But in the present political climate where the percentage of white voters is shrinking — Harris being doubly of color makes Trump nervous. That she could excite Black voters to the extent that they were excited when Barack Obama ran for president is making the party of white nationalism nervous. That she could consolidate the Indian American vote makes her a double threat. That she could inspire women to turn out this November makes her a virtual atomic bomb to the GOP. Historically, people of color had to be whatever white people said we were. Now that they’re afraid that being a person of color may provide some limited benefit, they wish to intimate that race is something mutable, subject to flights of fancy. It is terrifyingly revealing, that the practice of racial exclusivity, which Black people had nothing to do with, is being refashioned into a weapon against Harris in the moment when her blackness could be of some benefit to her and the community that supports her bid for the presidency.  James Baldwin, who was born 100 years ago this month, said it best, “We can disagree and still love each other, unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.” Trump’s comments deny the humanity of biracial people and challenges our right to exist. He bugles a call being taken up by many who follow his lead. The day Biden endorsed Harris for president, I posted on Instagram, “OMG!!! We got a Black Woman in the US presidential election!” In no time, there were more than 500 comments from the MAGA camp denying Harris’ Blackness, berating her as the unqualified DEI hire and accusing me of being racist. Multiple people reported the post as offensive. Some directly messaged me to ask how I would feel if they had posted about a white man running for president. When my answer did not suffice, I was dismissed as a “dumb coconut” who didn’t deserve to vote because I didn’t have the good sense to see through a candidate who was pretending to be Black to get my vote. Pretending to be Black. Unless they look white and are trying hard to pass, nobody’s Blackness in America is invisible. To suggest that Blackness is a cloak that Harris can put on and remove at will is to discredit the experience of millions of voting Americans who navigate the pitfalls of racial oppression daily. What his off-the-rails performance at the NABJ convention illustrates is Trump’s inability to come to terms with the changing face of the Unites States of America. Trump, the MAGA candidate, longs for the good old days when he could, at least before he got sued by the Justice Department, bar Black people from renting his properties. He is angry at a world that dares to proffer a Black woman, an Indian woman, as a serious contender for president. He does not wish to live in this new, emerging America. That’s one of many reasons he should not be elected to lead it."
70,"As Trump backs out of debate with Harris, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 06:30:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-backs-debate-kamala-harris-what-now-election-2024-rcna165138,"In his imagination, Donald Trump is a man of incredible bravery. In 2018, for example, after a gunman killed 17 people in a Florida high school, the Republican boasted that he would’ve had the courage to run into the school during the mass shooting. In remarks to the nation’s governors, the then-president said at the time, “I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” It was a difficult line to take seriously, but it was a peek into a weird perspective: In Trump’s mind, he’s effectively an action star. People were supposed to believe the septuagenarian president would’ve voluntarily run into an ongoing deadly crisis, where he’d confront a teen armed with an assault rifle, carrying with him nothing but his wits and his bare hands. Trump’s reality, of course, is far different. The former president is better known for promising to take the stand in court cases, only to back down with the pressure on. He’s also the candidate who thought it’d be a good idea to agree to a presidential debate in September, only to ditch the idea when Democrats rallied behind a candidate that scares him. NBC News reported: There were some headlines over the weekend about Trump “agreeing” to debate Harris, but that’s not quite what happened. Rather, what Trump decided to do was back out of a debate he and his team had previously agreed to, while simultaneously proposing a different event, the details of which he prefers. The Republican originally said he’d appear at a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News, without an audience. The GOP nominee has abandoned that commitment, instead saying he’s prepared to appear at a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News, “with a full arena audience.” It’s not altogether clear whether Trump ran this by Fox News — the network had pitched the idea of hosting a possible event on Sept. 17 — though it’s also possible that the former president is working from the assumption that Fox will simply follow his directions. For Harris, all of this is apparently absurd: The incumbent vice president has said she’ll stick to the plan that Team Trump originally agreed to, and she’s asking the former president to honor his commitment. That, evidently, isn’t likely to happen. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping, Trump posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” None of this comes as too big of a surprise. Almost immediately after Biden ended his re-election campaign, the GOP nominee started backing away from a possible debate. On Friday morning, before formally ditching the existing plan, Trump told Fox Business, “I mean, right now I say, why should I do a debate?” At some level, the former president probably realizes this makes him look like a coward, but in the electoral calculus, he’s apparently concluded that it’s better to look weak than show up on a debate stage and look worse. So where does this leave us? While presidential debates have become a common staple in recent decades, in the not-too-distant past, such events were rarities. In the 1964, 1968 and 1972 election cycles, for example, Americans did not see the major-party nominees share a stage. Unless Trump musters the courage to change his mind, 2024 will be a throwback to that bygone era."
71,"‘Republicans for Harris’ launch features key names, impressive numbers",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 05:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-harris-launch-key-names-impressive-numbers-election-2024-rcna165131,"Nine days into her 2024 candidacy, Vice President Kamala Harris picked a couple of notable Republican endorsements: Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan threw his support behind the Democrat fairly quickly, and John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona’s third-largest city, endorsed her soon after. Given the state of the cotemporary GOP, it’s not easy for any Democratic candidate to pick up cross-party backing, so this represented a decent start. But hanging overhead was an obvious question: Would other Republicans soon follow? The question received a rather emphatic answer over the weekend. NBC News reported: Those names are, of course, just a sampling. According to a press statement from the incumbent vice president’s campaign, Republicans for Harris includes endorsements from former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye; former Secretaries Chuck Hagel and Ray LaHood; former Governors Jim Edgar, Bill Weld, and Christine Todd Whitman; former U.S. House members Rod Chandler, Tom Coleman, Dave Emery, Wayne Gilchrest, Jim Greenwood, Adam Kinzinger, John LeBoutillier, Susan Molinari, Jack Quinn, Denver Riggleman, Claudine Schneider, Christopher Shays, Peter Smith, Alan Steelman, David Trott, and Joe Walsh; and former GOP State Chair and State Senator Chris Vance, among others. “As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,” Kinzinger said in a written statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House. Donald Trump poses a direct threat to fundamental American values. He only cares about himself, and his pursuit of power. “That’s what we saw on January 6 when he sent a mob to overturn our lawful election, who violently attacked law enforcement and ransacked our nation’s Capitol in the process,” the former member of the Jan. 6 committee added. “There’s too much at stake to sit on the sidelines, which is why I wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris for president. Now is the time for us all to unite to save our democracy and defeat Donald Trump one last time.” What’s more, the “Republicans for Harris” rollout is apparently about more than simply including names on a list. The Associated Press reported that the program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” using well-known Republicans “to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said.” The list might also yet grow: NBC News’ report noted that Team Harris is especially interested in targeting former Rep. Liz Cheney and former Sen. Jeff Flake. I kept a close eye on this dynamic four years ago and found quite a few GOP partisans — former Republican National Committee chairs, former Republican cabinet secretaries, former Republican governors, and former Republican members of Congress — who publicly expressed support for the Biden-led Democratic ticket. As Election Day 2024 approaches, Harris is well positioned to benefit from similar cross-party support — which Trump will almost certainly lack. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
72,Kamala Harris has MAGA world freaking out about demons and the apocalypse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-04 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-maga-jezebel-apocalypse-rcna164922,"It’s always the end of the world for the Make America Great Again movement. Ever since Donald Trump’s escalator ride in 2015, there’s been zero nuance to the MAGA message. “Only I can fix it,” the leader roared to thunderous applause upon accepting the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. But especially since Vice President Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic nominee, MAGA messaging has gone from overwrought and hyperbolic to absolutely hysterical and apocalyptic. Trumpists wave off any and all criticism as unworthy of discussion, bad-faith accusations from minds afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. And yet, deranged is the only appropriate descriptor of the rhetoric emanating from MAGA land’s loudest megaphones. It’s Trump and some of his closest allies and most prominent boosters who have been speaking of an imminent totalitarian government, end times and literal biblical demons. These people include podcasters with massive, fiercely dedicated audiences. Titans of industry. Religious extremists with political ambitions and close ties to Trump world. And the richest man in the world. In just the past week, popular MAGA pundits warned that Harris is “Hitler and Stalin combined but times 200,” and also a “commie” who will choose a running mate who supports “allowing men to beat up women in the Olympics.” They also expressed outrage over the opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics as the end of “Western civilization,” and singled out one woman on a Zoom fundraiser call for Harris’ campaign as another harbinger of end times. Then there was the billionaire Trump supporter who finally freed himself from the burden of pretending he’s not MAGA, Elon Musk, bringing back one of his favorite apocalyptic buzzwords, “extinctionist,” to describe Harris. (And because he’s a serious adult, he called her “Shamala.”) Musk once generally reserved that term for environmentalists — or really anyone concerned about climate change. But he’s since expanded the definition to anything that involves the mysterious and horror-movie-sounding “woke mind virus.” In 2023, Musk told Joe Rogan, “It’s essentially the extinctionists. It is that they’re propagating the extinction of humanity and civilization.” It’s hard to argue what’s “most disturbing” among these deranged comments from very angry people, but a worthy contender came from Lance Wallnau, the influential Christian nationalist who has the ears of both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. He likened the first Black and Indian woman to be nominated for president by a major party to Jezebel — a spirit with demonic powers. In case he wasn’t driving the point home with just the name, Wallnau clarified that Harris represents “the spirit of Jezebel … in a way that’ll be even much more ominous than Hillary because she’ll bring a racial component and she’s younger.” The MAGA right hasn’t cornered the market on ridiculous and irresponsible hyperbole in politics. Left, right and center are all capable of taking liberties with facts, hyping the fear factor and exaggerating the stakes. But of all American political tribes, there’s only one with politically influential figures using this election season to prophesize about Jezebels and explicitly making it about race and gender. Or literally warning of the imminent end of the world because of a Marxist conspiracy to smuggle totalitarianism on an unsuspecting public through environmentalism. This was once the content you’d find on the furthest, most ridiculous fringes of the AM radio dial. And they are what remains of the brain trust of the MAGA movement. The first Trump presidency — right up to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and ultimate incitement of a riot at the Capitol — was consistent in the fact that the only people who stayed until the end were the true believers. Anyone with a modicum of independence was jettisoned, forever. The aforementioned MAGA influencers are worthy of ridicule, sure, but they’re more worthy of thoughtful, diligent scrutiny, because they’d be guiding forces of what might pass for principles in a second Trump administration."
73,Kamala Harris shouldn’t ignore immigration. She should run on it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-04 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-defend-immigration-become-president-rcna164423,"As Democrats have coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, Republicans have, in turn, coalesced around their main issue to attack: immigration. President Joe Biden had struggled to respond to immigration criticism. Harris can do better, and she should start by doing the one thing that Biden failed to do: defending immigrants.  Biden’s strategy was simply to ignore immigration. When pressed, he’d say, “They should all be going back.” During his debate with former President Donald Trump, he touted his recent “total ban” on asylum. It’s no surprise that with both parties’ nominees arguing in favor of restriction, more voters are shifting to the Trump position.  But elevating the Trump position hurt Biden and will hurt Harris. If voters want Trump policies, they will elect Trump. At this point, it’s worse than wasted breath to talk about how Biden’s team tried to deport as many people as it could. Defending immigrants would be the most unexpected way to turn the tide in her favor.  The only speech Trump knows how to give is: “Immigrants are coming over the border to kill you.” But the facts about crime are devastating to Trump: When he was president, homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, and as immigrants have come in under the Biden administration, the violent crime and homicide rates have fallen by historic amounts.  Do immigrants deserve any credit? Probably! Immigrants commit fewer serious crimes that put them in prison, including fewer criminal homicides, than U.S.-born Americans. At the same time, by buying vacant homes and starting businesses at higher rates, they revitalize distressed neighborhoods hollowed out by pandemic-induced population loss. This indirectly lowers the crime rate.  Harris should ask Trump directly: So why do you want less safe, shrinking communities with higher crime rates?  Trump would no doubt also say, as he did during his convention speech, that the Biden immigration surge has brought “poverty” and “destruction to communities all across our land.” Harris should be ready.  Destruction? The Congressional Budget Office finds that the surge will boost the economy by $7 trillion and reduce the federal debt by nearly $1 trillion by 2034.  With America’s aging population, the country is millions of workers short of what Social Security needs for revenues to meet expenses by 2034, and the Social Security trustees say immigration will help close the gap. The Federal Reserve chair believes that new immigrants most likely helped stave off a recession by increasing economic growth.  Again, Harris should ask Trump: Why do you want a smaller economy with more debt? Why do you want to undermine Social Security? Do you want a recession? Trump hates to talk about immigration as an economic phenomenon partly because, as a business owner who has hired undocumented workers, he knows that it is beneficial. Instead, he would deflect to something else, like fentanyl trafficking.  Once again, Harris has the facts: U.S. citizens are 89% of fentanyl traffickers, and when did fentanyl overdoses spike? In 2020, under Trump, when the border was supposedly closed. According to recent academic research, immigration is associated with fewer overdose deaths. This is most likely because immigrants are much less likely to be consumers of dangerous drugs, so they overdose much less than other people. Trump’s efforts to demonize immigrants work when his opponents don’t bother countering his attacks. Harris doesn’t have to lead with immigration. But she can’t simply let Trump spew lies about immigrants for hours and expect it not to hurt her chances.  This confrontational approach may seem too risky politically, but it’s worth remembering that Joe Biden campaigned in 2020 against Trump’s harsh policies, and he won. In the general election debate, he criticized Trump for deporting asylum-seekers to “squalor.” His reversal hasn’t helped him. It has only validated Trump’s criticisms. Democrats’ instincts are right in one respect: Americans really don’t like chaos. Harris shouldn’t defend lawlessness. Instead, she should tout how the administration is quietly rebuilding the legal immigration system devastated by four years of President Trump and creating new legal ways for people to come, reducing illegal immigration.  Much more work must be done to fix the system, but Harris can credibly say she wants people to come lawfully. How exactly does Trump think people should come? Well, Trump’s record shows that he only slashed legal immigration. He didn’t reduce illegal immigration. That’s the only answer that matters. Harris needs to see that Biden’s defensiveness about immigration failed badly. She must start from a position of strength. Immigrants — legal and illegal — are helping America solve its biggest challenges. Force Trump to explain why that’s bad. He can’t, but so far, he has never had to. Now is Harris’ chance to change that."

His son Chip Carter had asked if he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday, according to Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator. The nonagenarian then told his son, “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” his grandson said. Carter entered hospice care at his Georgia home in February 2023. He is the oldest living and longest-lived former president in U.S. history. He will turn 100 years old on Oct. 1, and early voting in Georgia begins on Oct. 15. Carter has had less frosty relations with Donald Trump relative to his fellow former Democratic presidents. He has criticized some of Trump’s behaviors while also defending him from the media in the past. However, in 2019, he suggested that the Republican was an illegitimate president, saying, “Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.” Meanwhile, Trump has made references to the 99-year-old in his attacks on President Joe Biden. During a campaign speech in January, Trump brought up former first lady Rosalynn Carter’s funeral (which his wife attended but he did not) saying, “It was beautiful. Jimmy Carter was there. I thought to myself, ‘Jimmy Carter is happy now, because he will go down as a brilliant president by comparison to Joe Biden.’”"
75,Harris campaign says Trump is ‘running scared’ after he floats Fox News debate with new rules,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-03 09:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-debate-kamala-harris-audience-fox-news-rcna164990,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is insisting that Donald Trump honor his commitment to the ABC News debate on Sept. 10, rather than schedule an entirely different debate with new terms and a new date. “Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” the Harris campaign said in a statement on Saturday. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept. 10.” After refusing for several weeks to commit to debating Harris, the former president wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday that he had “agreed” to a Fox News debate against her on Sept. 4 with a “FULL ARENA AUDIENCE,” reneging on previously agreed-upon debate rules that he had set with President Joe Biden’s campaign. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment sent by NBC News early Saturday. Not having a live audience at the debate had been one of the Biden campaign’s key demands, especially against an opponent who is more prone to lying and delivering sound bites than to engaging in substantive policy discussion. Trump has waffled on his participation in the Sept. 10 debate since Biden dropped out of the race. Harris has repeatedly challenged Trump to meet her on the debate stage, and Democrats have taunted the former president as being “afraid” to go up against Harris, a former prosecutor. In his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the ABC News debate had been “terminated” because Biden had stepped aside, and he cited his ongoing litigation against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos as a “conflict of interest” (while using a disparaging distortion of Stephanopoulos’ name). Trump’s defamation lawsuit against Stephanopoulos and ABC News had already been underway when his campaign agreed to the Sept. 10 debate with the network. The Harris campaign said Saturday that it would be “happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to.” The de facto Democratic nominee will still appear at the ABC News event whether or not Trump participates, her campaign said."
76,The real reason Team Trump keeps trying to call Kamala Harris a ‘DEI hire’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-03 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/team-trump-calls-kamala-harris-dei-hire-rcna164117,"Despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ education, her years as a prosecutor, her having served as California attorney general and a U.S. senator, Republicans such as Reps. Harriet Hageman, of Wyoming, and Tim Burchett, of Tennessee, are among many who have referred to her as a “DEI hire.” Hageman said: “I think she’s one of the weakest candidates I’ve ever seen in the history of our country. I mean intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel. ... I think that she was a DEI hire.” Burchett referred to her as “our DEI vice president.” They could have attacked Harris’ record without referring to DEI, but instead they chose to say “DEI hire” and “DEI vice president” to perpetuate a narrative that people of color and women can only be in positions of power or authority because of quotas, preferential treatment and unfair advantage given to them based on their social identities. That is: not because of their education, qualifications, training or experience. These false racist and sexist attacks seek to reinforce beliefs that the best, and potentially only, people qualified to lead America are white men. Attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion are attempts to maintain the status quo.    Attacking the credibility of people of color, women, people with disabilities and others from historically marginalized groups is nothing new in America. The only thing new is the collective misrepresentation of the term diversity, equity, and inclusion to do it. The acronym DEI has been weaponized by people who feel threatened by the racial diversification of America and its leadership; the success of women in corporate and public sector jobs; the mere presence of people with disabilities in the workplace and in society; as well as the increased visibility of LGBTQ+ people and their families. They perceive that reality as an existential crisis. In addition to elected officials, there have been numerous recent examples of highly visible powerbrokers and pundits denigrating people of color, specifically Black people, claiming they are unqualified for the positions they hold, and that they were hired based on their race, not merit. In January, not long after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in flight, Elon Musk took to his social media platform X to criticize efforts by United Airlines and Boeing to diversify their pilots and factory workers. “It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE,” he wrote, misspelling the acronym.  He was responding to an X user who speculated about the IQs of pilots who attended historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. The next day, Musk said, “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening.” His lie that the airline’s DEI policies had endangered the public was shared with millions of X users. Again, this is not new. First, powerful opponents of progress sought to discredit and gut affirmative action policies. Now they have their sights set on anything they choose to label DEI. This strategy to characterize Black people as unqualified, framed within the context of “DEI hires,” is a targeted effort to attack policies and practices that have created pathways to leadership and power for people of color, women, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, and others. Because while “DEI hire” has been most frequently used to discredit women and people of color, it is also used to devalue the contributions of people with disabilities and other marginalized and oppressed identities. The weaponization of the term DEI cuts across sectors and disciplines, including in health care and medicine, where I have had health care executives tell me that DEI efforts in hospitals or medical schools lower standards and thereby jeopardize the quality of care provided to patients. One health care executive went so far as to say that “a diverse hire,” another way to say DEI hire, would underperform because they trained at an HBCU. Although factually inaccurate, these beliefs about DEI have taken hold in our national narrative.  So, what is DEI really? Diversity, equity and inclusion supports full participation of all people; promotes fair treatment through the intentional use of power, policies and practices; and values individuals within the context of their identities, not in spite of them. It is a response to glaring inequities throughout society, particularly those in education and employment. Recent reversals of public and institutional policies that advance DEI are most often the result of orchestrated resistance by people who believe that DEI will disenfranchise and disempower white people, especially white men. Frankly, the data does not support those claims. After decades of policies and practices to support DEI, inequities in opportunities and pay continue to plague women and people of color. A 2021 study by Judd Kessler and Corinne Low found that “firms hiring in STEM fields rated minority and female candidates significantly lower than white males. Among STEM majors, to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75 GPA, a minority or female candidate needed a 4.0.” Even with DEI policies in place, Black women make 66 cents on the dollar compared with their white male counterparts, when doing the same jobs with comparable qualifications. These statistics and examples indicate the necessity of DEI. They also point to how dangerous the misappropriation and weaponization of DEI is to decades of slow and fragile social progress and policy change.  The truth about DEI is that it promotes American values that are necessary for a healthy, functional and thriving democracy. It is consistent with ideals such as liberty and justice for all people. That is not a zero-sum game where one group’s gain is another’s loss. Instead, it is America making good on its promise to create a society where everyone can flourish and contribute their talents and skills to the collective good while having a fair chance to succeed. These ideals are woven into the complex fabric of who we are as a nation, and we cannot afford to regress to darker times.

When asked whether Trump’s comments — which were roundly condemned as racist and even alarmed some Republicans — gave him pause, the Ohio senator said they did not. Vance added: This wasn’t the first time that Vance — who himself has had the authenticity of his Appalachian ties called into question — has used the line of attack on the vice president. At a campaign rally earlier this week, he said that Harris had used “a fake Southern accent” during an event in Atlanta and suggested that she was more Canadian than American. (Harris lived in Canada for about six years as a teenager.) The ease with which Vance endorsed Trump’s attack on Harris should put past comments of his own under scrutiny. While running for the Senate in 2022, Vance pushed back on his Democratic opponent’s charge that he was promoting the “great replacement” theory — even though he manifestly did — and pointed to his children, who are white and Indian, as proof that he had not engaged in racism. “What happens is that my own children, my biracial children, get attacked by scumbags online and in person because you are so desperate for political power that you’ll accuse me, the father of three beautiful biracial babies, of engaging in racism,” Vance said at the time. That Vance has decried racist attacks on his children and yet is now endorsing an attack on his political opponent’s biracial identity is worth noting. In his comments to CNN, Vance appeared to equate Harris’ leaning into her different racial identities at different times as part of a broader pattern of her flip-flopping on issues. But there’s a difference between changing one’s stance on a topic — as Vance himself has done — and the immutable fact of Harris’ biracial identity. Vance, as the father of biracial children himself, should know that."
78,Prisoner deal undermines one of Trump’s attack lines against Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 08:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prisoner-deal-undermines-one-trumps-attack-lines-harris-rcna164870,"Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, and when the host started to ask how international leaders would respond to a Kamala Harris presidency, the Republican interrupted before she was even done with the question. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be like a play toy.” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” In context, the implicit racism and sexism in the on-air comments seemed obvious. The fact that Trump was an international laughingstock during his White House tenure didn’t help matters, either. But the idea that Harris wouldn’t be taken seriously on the international stage was also discredited by reality soon after Trump made his ugly remarks. The Wall Street Journal reported: The Journal’s report added that Harris had met Scholz previously on several occasions, and as an administration official put it, the vice president had a “good working relationship with him.” That’s “part of the reason why she was able to have a really good, frank conversation with him.” A White House official also confirmed with NBC News that when it came to the difficult international process, Harris “moved the ball forward significantly.” Note, Harris hadn’t met Slovenia’s Golob before this year’s Munich Security Conference, and as the Journal’s report noted, “Their meeting was the highest-level U.S. engagement at the time with the Slovenian government, which was holding two Russian nationals Moscow wanted released. That meeting was also restricted to just Harris, Golob and two aides.” Slovenia soon after agreed to participate in the international deal, which is what happens when foreign officials take U.S. officials seriously."
79,"Returning to his roots, Trump promotes Harris’ birth certificate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 07:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-promotes-kamala-harris-birth-certificate-election-2024-rcna164848,"The headline on a Punchbowl News report on Thursday stood out: “It’s 2016 all over again following Trump’s racist attacks on Harris.” A day earlier, a Fox News personality told viewers that there’s “2016 energy” around this year’s presidential race. A NOTUS report had a related message today: ""A woman atop the Democratic ticket. GOP lawmakers dodging the press. Trump. Birtherism. The 2024 election has a bit of everything that made 2016 memorable."" At first blush, the analysis seems compelling. In 2016, Donald Trump faced the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket; he targeted her with ugly and sexist attacks; and eight years later, the Republican is recycling many of the same words and phrases as he prepares to face the second woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket. All the while, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pretending to have no idea what Trump is saying, which is similarly reminiscent of what the political world saw during his 2016 candidacy. But to fully appreciate the scope of the former president’s ridiculous antics, perhaps it’s best to look back even further — not to 2016, but to 2010. Trump has spent much of the week questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial and ethnic identity, suggesting the nation’s first Black vice president might not be Black enough by his standards. But as a New York Times report noted, the Republican nominee went even further yesterday. Yes, the conspiracy theorist who helped pioneer the racist “birther” attacks against Barack Obama — several years before he came down the escalator and took over GOP politics — has decided, more than a decade later, to once again take an interest in another Black candidate’s birth certificate. As Off Message's Brian Beutler argued, this is less like 2016 and more like what voters would've heard ""if Trump had challenged Obama in 2012 as a birtherism dead-ender."" The Washington Post asked Loomer yesterday whether she's the one who brought this line of attack to Trump’s attention. “Probably,” the right-wing personality replied, noting that she’d shared the image with the former president. Common sense suggests Trump, given his ridiculous antics targeting Obama's background, should steer clear of even passing references to birth certificates, but evidently, he can’t seem to help himself."
80,The Harris honeymoon ends soon. She'd better be ready for what's next.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-energized-democrats-party-faces-maga-republicans-rcna164603,"Democrats have had a remarkable two weeks, as Vice President Kamala Harris has re-energized their hopes for retaining the White House and definitively turning the page on the Trump era. But it’s only been two weeks. Even in the most abbreviated general election campaign in modern history, the likely Democratic nominee will face three full months of negative advertising, blunders and bad luck, just like any other candidate. As the honeymoon phase comes to a close, the newly cemented Harris campaign needs to lay the groundwork for what’s next, take advantage of its tremendous grassroots support across the country, and prepare a counteroffensive to the coming attacks. Last week on MSNBC, veteran Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats to “get ready. They’re coming after us.” He added, “This kind of giddy elation is not gonna be very helpful much longer.” Carville’s comments weren’t directed at voters, but instead at the Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee. As the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, I view his warning as a message to those in power within the Democratic Party to get to work. Over the next three months, Democrats at all levels need to harness the enthusiasm for Harris into action. The Trump campaign was caught off guard by the quick consolidation of support for the vice president, but Democrats need to prepare for a full-throated attack. MAGA Republicans won’t go down without a fight. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s combative interview at the National Association of Black Journalists conference — in which he went after her race and gender directly — followed by his social media posts and a speech by vice presidential nominee JD Vance criticizing her as “chameleon-like” flip-flopper have shown that the gloves are already coming off. Trump’s Republican Party sees this election as a last chance at holding power. Look no further than Project 2025. Trump-aligned conservatives at the Heritage Foundation didn’t spend years on an agenda to overhaul our nation’s institutions for nothing. The MAGA movement will work tooth and nail to win this election so they can implement a far-right authoritarian takeover. Don’t let the head fake of the Trump campaign “distancing” itself from Project 2025 fool you. These are the stakes of the 2024 presidential election, and the Harris campaign should know what it’s up against. Trump and his allies will resort to vicious attacks in an attempt to define Harris. Some of those lines of attack will land in the minds of some voters. As the boxer Mike Tyson famously said, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. A good team of advisers and strong messaging should help them navigate those moments. The shift to Harris may stymie Trump and his campaign, but they’re already pouring millions of dollars into TV ads in battleground states. This new advertising blitz is part of Trump’s effort to define Harris as a failed “border czar” (a title she did not have, though that will not deter them). Immigration is a major vulnerability for Democrats and the Harris campaign, but they can undercut this weakness with the right messaging. Harris wasted no time reframing the issue on her terms this week in Atlanta. She spent the first part of her stump speech highlighting her tenure as California attorney general. Harris touted her record of prosecuting transnational gang members and human traffickers who came to the U.S. illegally. She also reminded voters that Trump pressured Senate Republicans to block a bipartisan deal to secure the border. Harris told the crowd, “Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.” The Harris campaign knows it can’t sit around and let Trump control the narrative. That’s why Harris wasted no time building a narrative of her own. She’s a former prosecutor and Trump is a criminal. This early stage of any campaign is a battle of definitions, and the contrast is stark. While energy and excitement are great for raising money and gathering volunteers, if you haven’t prepared to be smacked upside the head by an asymmetrical political actor, all that money and energy won’t be enough to break through that wall on Election Day. Democrats should seize on this moment of enthusiasm, but they can’t get caught up in the moment. The goal now should be manifesting this bolt of energy into a three-month game plan to win at the ballot box. From now until Nov. 5, every day matters. The Harris campaign needs to make the most of every minute. As a former party chairman, I know every moment counts.

81,Why Kamala Harris’ biracial identity upsets Donald Trump so much,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 16:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-interview-kamala-harris-black-indian-nabj-rcna164736,"Early in Donald Trump’s meltdown at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists convention, the former president offered unsolicited commentary on the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. “She was Indian all the way,” Trump said of his presumptive opponent, “and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person. Somebody should look into that.” There is a multitude of problems with Trump’s comments, from his presumption that he has the expertise and jurisdiction to judge someone else’s identity to his argument that Harris lacks the racial bona fides to merit the Black audience members’ allegiance. But the former president’s ramble offers another important conclusion: Trump simply doesn’t understand race. When Trump asks for somebody to “look into that,” the truth is that for years researchers have looked into that. What they’ve found is that overly simplified perspectives on race like Trump’s are not only misplaced, but they are counterproductive and dangerous. Scholars of race have long argued, and demonstrated, that race is a socially constructed category that still has very real outcomes. We, as members of society, constantly construct, deconstruct and reconstruct what race means. Even the basics of how race is measured in America have evolved over time. The 1850 U.S. census was the first to acknowledge people of multiracial descent, with the category “Mulatto” used as a way to exclude them from having full political rights. Not until the 2000 census were multiracial Americans able to formally mark more than one racial identity. In fact, the multiracial population is the fastest growing racial group in the United States, with a 276% increase between 2010 and 2020. As ABC News’ Rachel Scott pointed out to Trump, Harris “has always identified as a Black woman. She went to a historically Black college.” (Harris graduated from Howard University, where she was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically African American sorority.) But in Trump’s worldview, you’re either Indian or you’re Black. You cannot be both. This is ironic considering his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, is the father of three biracial (Indian and white) children. Trump doubled down on this sentiment after the NABJ interview: At his rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that same day, his campaign displayed a graphic quoting Harris as having referred to herself as the “first Indian-American senator.” Which, of course, she was. And which, of course, does nothing to disprove her Blackness, because she is both. Trump fails to grasp what census takers recognized more than two decades ago and what Walt Whitman wrote two centuries ago: We contain multitudes. Harris is Indian. Harris is Black. This isn’t a contradiction. Trump’s recent comments mark but one in a series of episodes showing he shares a misunderstanding all too common even in today’s increasingly diverse and multiracial society: the (hyper) essentializing of race and other social categories. Researchers describe essentialism as seeing particular qualities as being intrinsic or inherent to a particular group of people. These beliefs (e.g., all women are bad at math) start to form in early childhood and can further solidify as one ages depending on one’s further socialization. Trump’s false confidence in the essentialized either/or nature of identity leads him to believe that once he knows what you are, he’ll also know how you’ll think and act. It opens the door to thinking that Jewish voters who opt for his opponent are “bad Jews,” his frequent claims about the monolithic notion of “Black jobs,” and referring to anyone who criticizes Israel — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer — as “a Palestinian,” even if Schumer was born in Brooklyn. Acknowledging the existence of multiracial identities completely scrambles this perspective and upsets the stereotypes that Trump holds close to his heart. People can claim more than one identity without being disingenuous. Our identities are not limited to those labels others apply to us. Individuals who share aspects of their identities — whether race, gender, religion or otherwise — cannot be expected to all think, act or vote in the same way. It is likely too late for Trump to accept and fully grasp that millions of Americans are multiracial. But we hope that his racist comments will prompt other Americans to think more flexibly about identity."
82,Donald Trump has always been ‘weird.’ Here's why it won’t work against Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 14:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-weird-kamala-harris-rcna164753,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Way Too Early."" Let’s talk about Donald Trump’s week.  Things started to kick off on Tuesday with Trump policing who is and isn’t a good Jew. The former president called a conservative radio show to escalate his attacks on Jewish Democrats, calling them “fools” and saying they “should have their heads examined.” Then on Wednesday, Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania where he mistakenly referred to Republican Senate candidate David McCormick as the state’s “next governor.” Twice.  Earlier that same day, Trump made an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference and took aim at his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris — accusing Harris, who's biracial, of “turning Black.” So in 24 hours, Trump went from deciding who’s a good Jew to who’s really Black or who’s really Asian.  This is a guy who is clearly struggling to find his footing against Harris. So what does he do? He goes back to his original playbook, one that dates back even further than 2016. He’s trying to play the greatest hits of birtherism all over again. Ever since the Republican Party’s convention it seems Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have leaned into the weirdness. It’s almost like Trump is saying, “Boy, you know that Vance is really weird. Hold my beer, because look what I’m going to do here.” But Trump’s appearances aren’t a one-off. What we witnessed this week is pure Donald Trump. This is who he is. This is what he looks like when he’s in a somewhat hostile environment and asked tough questions. He has a meltdown. This is a moment in American politics where you step back and realize that you have the Republican candidate for president playing the race card and engaging in some of the worst kinds of racial stereotyping. It's a repulsive moment in American politics, but it’s also a reminder of what Trump is doing and all he represents."
83,"The day after taking aim at Harris on race, Trump doubles down",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 09:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/day-taking-aim-harris-race-trump-doubles-election-2024-racism-rcna164716,"The opening salvo came unexpectedly in an unlikely setting. Donald Trump, appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention, thought it’d be a good idea to go after Vice President Kamala Harris on race. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the Republican presidential nominee said of his likely opponent on the Democratic side. “I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the former president added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded: “Is she Indian, or is she Black?” The backlash was immediate — and widespread. Even some Republicans described the GOP nominee’s racism as “embarrassing” and “awful.” An Axios report described Trump’s offensive as “a nightmare” for his party. But let’s not lose sight of the fact that Trump’s new line of attack wasn’t limited to the stage in Chicago. After the event, he used his social media platform to push a follow-up salvo. “Crazy Kamala is saying she’s Indian, not Black,” he wrote alongside a video of Harris referencing her Indian heritage. “This is a big deal.” Soon after, ahead of a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump’s political operation promoted images on a giant screen featuring headlines noting Harris’ Indian-American identity. On Thursday morning, as NBC News noted, the Republican nominee pushed the line of attack again. This, evidently, is Trump’s idea of a gotcha. So, why in the world is he doing this? I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s weird perspective, but the answer isn’t immediately obvious. It’s possible that Trump thinks he can convince Black voters that Harris isn’t Black enough. Or maybe Trump thinks it’s up to him, and not Harris, to decide how she should describe her own race and ethnicity. It’s also possible that Trump, whose lengthy record of overt racism is well documented, is genuinely confused about the very idea of someone being biracial. If Harris has celebrated her mother’s background, as far as the Republican sees it, it necessarily means she rejected her father’s background. Or maybe Trump’s brand of racism is based in part on the idea that those in communities of color get special breaks and benefits, making him uncomfortable with the idea of an opponent being able to check more than one box. Whatever the explanation, it seems like a safe bet that voters haven’t heard the last of this line of attack, even if many GOP officials would prefer to hear Trump say anything else. UPDATE (August 1, 2024, 2:26 p.m. ET): Shortly after I published this piece, Trump used his social media platform to amplify a related online item from right-wing media personality Laura Loomer, who claimed that Harris’ birth certificate ""proves"" that she's not Black."
84,Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion are on Kamala Harris' side — that's bad news for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 09:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-harris-beyonce-megan-thee-stallion-2024-rcna164566,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 30 episode of “The Beat.” Newly released audio of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has revealed what the vice presidential candidate really thinks about the 2024 Democratic ticket shake-up. Vance privately told donors Vice President Kamala Harris’ entrance into the race was “a little bit of a political sucker punch”: “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.” To say Harris isn’t struggling is an understatement. She is thriving. While no one knows who will win in November, Republicans can clearly see Harris’ appeal. That kind of appeal is the reason the party pushed hard at the Republican National Convention to feature anything that might feel somewhat cool or current — from Hulk Hogan to rap videos to Instagram star Amber Rose. Republicans know culture matters to voters.  But now the party now has the oldest nominee ever. While Donald Trump did have a run on television and a presence online before he entered politics, “The Apprentice” debuted 20 years ago. It’s a relic of a reality TV past. Harris, on the other hand, taps into the now and the future. That much is evident from the soundtrack of her first campaign video, which features a song from a superstar currently on music charts: Beyoncé. In the song “Freedom,” Beyoncé recounts fighting uphill battles, both personal and political: “Freedom! Where are you? ’Cause I need freedom, too! I break chains all by myself.” And while the Harris campaign’s song choice does have political appeal, this isn’t just posturing from a candidate. The vice president is a genuine, longtime Beyoncé fan, even attending a show last year in the tour’s official sparkle theme attire.  As a senator, she shouted out Beyoncé's documentary, “Homecoming,” for how it “celebrates” historically Black colleges. The feeling seems mutual. In 2020, on the eve of the election, Beyoncé posted a photo on Instagram wearing a Biden-Harris mask — broadcasting her approval of the ticket to over 300 million followers. Pop culture is a language young people speak fluently. That demographic was crucial to the winning Biden-Harris coalition in 2020. In 2024, the vice president needs their support again.  Most voters oppose fake posturing from politicians, and Harris comes across in this cultural moment honestly. She did even so before there were signs she would top the ticket.  Harris has used her platform as vice president to elevate artists and art forms Washington has long ignored. Last year, she hosted a celebration at her official residence to mark hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. The event featured artists like Lil Wayne and Jeezy.  The celebration became something of a national Rorschach test: Do you see energy, optimism and inclusion? Or do you see something else? It’s clear the Republicans want you to see something else. On Tuesday, Trump released his first attack ad on Harris, featuring video of her dancing from that 2023 hip-hop celebration — an attempt to portray the vice president as somehow less serious of a politician. But as Republicans continue their attacks on Harris, trying to see what sticks, another star has thrown her support behind the vice president: Beyoncé's fellow Houstonian Megan Thee Stallion. The rap star is no stranger to political statements. In 2021, she dropped her own anthem about women’s rights. The music video shows a Republican senator, in a MAGA-red tie, going online to hypocritically attack her in misogynistic terms. In the video, Megan confronts him for disrespecting the women who keep things running. On Tuesday, Megan Thee Stallion joined Harris for a rally in Georgia, where the star urged her fans — dubbed “Hotties” — to stand behind the vice president. A “Hot Girl Summer” for Harris, indeed. From Beyoncé to Megan Thee Stallion to Charli XCX, the vice president’s set list of support keeps growing longer and longer by the day. Can the Republican Party and Donald Trump muster anything to match it?

85,'Super genius' economists say Trump budget is costlier than Harris plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 03:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-penn-wharton-economy-harris-rcna168687,"For what feels like the umpteenth time, experts are highlighting major aspects of Donald Trump’s economic policy that could hurt the economy and spike deficits. Two new reports from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model — part of the school Trump has attended and described as “super genius stuff” — found the GOP presidential nominee's economic proposals would increase the deficit nearly five times more than Vice President Kamala Harris' plans.  As CNBC explained: In contrast, here’s how CNBC summarized the Harris report: CNBC added the caveat that much of the revenue Harris hopes to generate with her economic plan requires congressional approval. But even with that caveat, the predictions are stark: Trump’s economic proposals would be all but certain to raise deficits dramatically — as he did when he was president — relative to Harris’ plans, which could cost about a fifth as much as his, according to the reports. Polls suggest most Americans feel the candidate most equipped to handle the economy isn’t always the candidate with the most salient economic plan. Trump’s plan has been panned several times now, despite his apparent polling strength on the issue.  The Penn reports follow a joint letter from 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists in June, who warned that Trump’s economic plan — particularly, his plan to deport immigrants en masse and impose 10% tariffs on all imports — would fuel inflation. And Moody’s Analytics came out with a report in June that reached a similar conclusion.  It's no wonder Trump and his campaign have worked so hard to undermine their movement’s faith in economic experts."
86,"Trump, while reflecting on assassination attempt, puts blame on Biden and Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-dr-phil-interview-assassination-attempt-biden-harris-rcna168617,"Donald Trump said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are at fault “to a certain extent” for the attempt on his life last month in Pennsylvania, blaming them for security deficiencies even though the president and vice president have no involvement in Secret Service assignments. “He always made it very tough for us to have the proper number of Secret Service people,” Trump said about Biden in an interview with TV personality Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil. “When this happened, people would ask, whose fault is it? I think to a certain extent it’s Biden’s fault and Harris’ fault,” Trump added in the interview, which aired Tuesday. “And I’m the opponent. Look, they were weaponizing government against me, they brought in the whole DOJ to try and get me, they weren’t too interested in my health and safety.” Trump’s claim is entirely unfounded. The president and vice president are not involved in Secret Service assignments. The agency, which is funded by Congress, has faced a staffing shortage for years, as NBC News recently reported. A Secret Service official told NBC News that the shortfall has resulted in denials of requests for extra personnel for Trump over the past two years, but added that no such requests had been turned down for the rally where he was shot. On Wednesday, FBI officials told reporters that Trump’s would-be assassin had searched online for information about both of the major parties’ national conventions and that the former president’s July 13 rally in Pennsylvania appears to have been a “target of opportunity.” Trump’s comments escalate the tension in an already heated election year. Republicans have blamed the shooting on Democrats for calling Trump a threat to democracy after he has repeatedly vowed to tear through political norms and governmental systems of checks and balances. Analysts and experts have said that the surge of violent threats against election officials is in part motivated by Trump’s own vengeful rhetoric toward those he perceives as enemies. In the interview, Trump spoke at length about the rally shooting. McGraw also appeared to egg him on, asking: “I’m not saying that they [Biden and Harris] wanted you to get shot, but do you think it was OK with them if you did?” “I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know,” Trump responded. “There’s a lot of hatred. I don’t know why. I had a great presidency.” At one point, the former president suggested that he may have survived the shooting because God wants him to save the world. “If I win that [the election], that would really serve to say that there’s some incredible power up there that wanted me to be involved — and maybe it’s more than saving the nation, maybe it’s saving the world,” Trump said."
87,How Obama’s biggest ‘controversy’ became Harris’ greatest opportunity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 13:01:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-tan-suit-vs-obama-tan-suit-rcna168627,"Ten years ago, President Barack Obama appeared at a press conference wearing a pale khaki suit and a gray, striped tie. The outfit choice prompted a slew of outraged headlines, particularly from Republicans. Then-New York Congressman Peter T. King contended that the choice was “unpresidential” and that it pointed to Obama’s “lack of seriousness.” On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris stepped onto the stage in a flared-leg tan suit designed by Chloé creative director Chemena Kamali. Harris paired the suit with a cream crepe de chine lavallière blouse, also by Chloé, and high-shine pointed-toe pumps. A similar double-breasted version of Harris’ jacket is available on Chloé’s website. The color listed below its steep price tag is fittingly and, given the tenor of the Harris’ campaign, unsurprisingly called coconut brown. The internet was quick to draw parallels between the two outfits. Many X users posited that Harris was deliberately evoking Obama’s tan suit, subtly trolling Republican pundits. Responses to a post made by MSNBC’s “The Weekend” Executive Producer Kyle Griffin included “troll game strong” and “I yelled and then had to explain to my kid why the tan suit was an expert level choice for her.” While the Harris-Walz campaign is quick to embrace all Obama-era commentary and has proven its internet fluency, this fashion moment was Harris’ alone. Harris’ campaign outfits are a sign of a new era of political dressing. Her campaign wardrobe, from the now iconic Chloé suit to her brightly colored tailored separates with pared down Chucks, is not representative of the bygone 2010s “Lean In” girlboss dressing or 1980s suiting as a means to battle in-office sexism. No, Harris’ outfits exist wholly in the context of today. The year 1992, dubbed “the year of the woman” for electing four women to the Senate, led to a significant moment for women’s suiting. The following year, then-Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski became the first woman to wear a pantsuit on the Senate floor when she and then-Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum launched a subdued but effective protest: They wore pants and told female staffers to do the same. In the years after, the pantsuit became the accepted and almost compulsory apparel for women in Washington, including for Hillary Clinton. Donning pants instead of skirts is historically revolutionary. Selecting clothing that exists outside of what is attractive to a patriarchal society is a weapon that women have used to protect themselves for generations, as a means to demand respect and safety. A contemporary, more grim, version of this can be seen in a viral TikTok trend showing young women covering their fashionable miniskirts with baggy t-shirts on the New York subway. Being a woman on public transportation, on Capitol Hill, in court rooms, on Wall Street and in newsrooms has until very recently been viewed a detriment. And while clothing, of course, neither protects you nor precludes you from sexual harassment or assault, the way you dress is a vehicle for respect, power and self-confidence. In the aftermath of #MeToo, standing on the shoulders of women trailblazers, traditionally male silhouettes are no longer required. Today, two things exist at once: womanhood and power. Harris’ Chloé suit set the tone for the rest of DNC and for the rest of her campaign. In wearing her  suits and not, say, a more conventional navy, knee-length skirt, Harris is signaling that she is unafraid to carve her own path forward. (As the first Black and Indian American woman on the ticket, this is impossible anyway.) In this way, this suit — a modern spin on traditionally accepted political women’s wear — mirrors her candidacy. Harris is demanding respect in her own way. Perhaps the most radical and revolutionary of all: Harris looks pretty. She looks presidential. Suits, although awash on the DNC stage, have little practical space in a contemporary woman’s wardrobe, except as subversive. It is chic and popular, in perpetuity, to wear a deconstructed suit to a formal event à la Bianca Jagger’s seminal Yves Saint Laurent wedding outfit. With more employees working from home, very few workplaces require the sort of formality that Washington still does. The suit has mostly been replaced with so-called power dressing: shoulder pads, oversized blazers, slouchy boyfriend-without-the-boyfriend jeans. Clothing that skews more gender neutral is not just trendy, but it is also mainstream. Once again, Harris has proved incredibly adroit at reading and tapping into the zeitgeist. Chloé and boho chic are experiencing a resurgence. A few weeks ago, Sydney Sweeney wore head-to-toe Chloé in black thigh-high leather boots, a cream-colored mini dress and capelet. Daisy Edgar-Jones spent much of her ""Twisters"" press tour in Chloé, including a stunning sky blue, sheer ruffled maxi dress. And Harris, having publicly worn the French brand at least three times, is now listed in their ranks. In 2008, one of the campaign slogans Obama ran on was “change we can believe.” Then, Americans were craving something different, something outside the beltway. His tan colored suit signaled that he was going to do things his way. It signaled that he was that change. Ten years later, Americans still want change they can believe in. Despite her policies, her record, her personal beliefs, Harris, as a powerful Black and Indian woman, will never be inside the beltway. Indeed, Harris’ fashion choices will be picked apart and analyzed in ways Barack Obama could never even fathom. She may as well wear a tan suit."
88,"As the GOP targets Harris’ border wall stance, the details matter",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 11:35:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-targets-harris-border-wall-stance-details-matter-rcna168652,"Sen. JD Vance, the Republican Party’s vice presidential nominee, mocked the idea this week that Vice President Kamala Harris “wants to build the border wall.” Hours later, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on Fox News and told viewers, “Graham: Do you really believe she’s going to build a wall? That’s just bulls---.” As for what prompted the partisan pushback, it apparently stems from a report Axios published. The headline read, “Harris flip-flops on building the border wall,” and the article began: A typical person reading this might believe that the Democratic presidential hopeful recently endorsed investing in a border wall, but that’s not quite what happened. Let’s take a brief stroll down memory lane. As regular readers might recall, it was last fall when congressional Republicans said they were so desperate to deal with U.S./Mexico border policies that they took a radical step: GOP officials said that unless Democrats agreed to a series of conservative reforms, Republicans were prepared to cut off military aid to Ukraine and let Russia take part of Eastern Europe by force. Democrats, left with little choice, agreed to pay the GOP’s ransom and endorsed a conservative, bipartisan compromise. At that point, Republicans killed the compromise plan they’d demanded — largely because Donald Trump told them to. Making matters worse, the calculus was electoral, not substantive: The former president didn’t want Congress to hand President Joe Biden an election-year victory on one of the party’s top priorities. Republicans followed Trump’s lead and concluded that they’d rather have a campaign issue than a solution. What does this have to do with allegations of Harris “flip-flopping”? The bipartisan compromise, which featured concessions from both parties, included some wall funding in the hopes of generating GOP support. It was a relatively modest sum — $650 million, roughly 3% of what the Trump administration sought in 2018 — and the funding wasn’t even new. (As Team Harris reminded Axios, the provision “just extended the timeline to spend funds that had been appropriated during Trump’s last year as president.”) The vice president has never been a wall advocate — in fact, she’s been a fierce critic of Trump’s plan — but she endorsed the Senate agreement in the hopes of getting something done on the issue. Six months after Republicans killed the deal they requested, using Harris' convention speech as a news hook, Axios summarized this in bullet-point form, at which point the right effectively declared, “A ha!” As lines of attack go, this is weak tea. If the Democratic nominee were to actually endorse the merits of a border wall, that would be a dramatic reversal worthy of attention. But her willingness to back a bipartisan compromise — which included provisions she and her party would not support on their own — does not a “flip-flop” make."
89,Mika: Kamala Harris is our 'best hope of saving health care for women in America',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 03:44:00,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/mika-kamala-harris-best-hope-saving-healthcare-women-america-rcna164562,"As we launch ""Know Your Value"" and Forbes’ fourth annual ""50 Over 50"" U.S. list (which may be our most impressive one yet), I think it’s important to note that our headliner for the very first list four years ago was Vice President Kamala Harris. And today, Harris at 59 years old is seen as the young, fresh face of presidential politics. Isn’t life sweet? When I first launched this list, I thought I would be paving the way for women in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and well beyond to validate their place, role and impact in today’s society. What I discovered is that we are catching up with a well-established successful global movement. Women over 50 are thriving, impactful, paving a long runway for the next generation. And now our young “50 Over 50” listee is leading the way for women at a time in U.S. politics when our health is at stake — literally. Vice President Kamala Harris is an internet sensation and has turned the race around breaking fundraising records in just one week. For women, her breakout campaign is just in time.  There is already so much suffering at the hands of Trump Republicans. There are women across the country who need abortion health care to either survive, be able to have babies again, or to save themselves and their families from trauma who are left with no options. Take Samantha Casiano, of East Texas, who found out at her 20-week ultrasound that her baby had a rare and fatal condition that prevented the skull and brain from fully forming. She was told her baby was going to die — but abortion laws in the state forced her to give birth anyway. Four hours after giving birth, Casiano’s daughter, Halo Hope, died in her arms. Or what about Deborah Dobert in Florida, who was forced to carry her son, Milo, to term — even though he had no kidneys and would die soon after birth. Not only did Milo die, doctors told Dobert that her pregnancy put her at high risk of preeclampsia, which can be fatal. And what about Christina Zielke, who was in Ohio when she started to miscarry. Because of the state’s six-week abortion ban, the ER wouldn’t treat her miscarriage even though she was bleeding profusely. Can you imagine “passing blood clots the size of golf balls” and being told by the hospital that it needed proof there was no fetal development and to come back in two days? It is as if we are living in the dark ages. So Kamala Harris is our first best hope of saving health care for women in America. It took just one generation for Harris (the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants) to reach the highest levels of government and to make history in America as the first Black, Asian and female candidate to lead a major party’s ticket. And that, my friends, is what America is all about. The excitement we are seeing and feeling about Harris is because she channels all of our dreams about this country — that literally anything is possible. And it comes at a time when the Republican nominee and his misogynistic running mate are campaigning on what is not possible.  They’re against abortion health care. They’re against a deal on immigration unless it serves them politically. They’re against saving Ukraine — and therefore peace in the world. They are against commonsense, gun safety measures. The list goes on and on. The emergence of Harris on the presidential campaign stage feels like the sun coming out after a long, dark storm. And it is so wonderful to be releasing a list that celebrates women at their most powerful stage in life, where their wisdom and life experience come together as they firmly reject the notion that their best years are behind them. And I simply think it’s absolutely amazing that Harris is the fresh, young face poised to fight for our freedoms and our future."
90,"Trump claims he’s agreed to debate Harris, but there’s a catch",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 05:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-agreed-debate-kamala-harris-election-campaign-2024-rcna168568,"Following a mind-numbing process, featuring multiple reversals, Donald Trump issued an unexpected announcement by way of his social media platform: The on-again, off-again ABC News debate against Vice President Kamala Harris is back on again. “I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a Debate with Comrade Kamala Harris,” the Republican wrote in his predictably juvenile and whiny style. “It will be Broadcast Live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.” In the same online missive, the former president claimed that “the Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate” — I’ll never know why he capitalizes random words — suggesting the candidates’ microphones will be muted except when they’re answering questions, just as the Republican's team had hoped. So, all’s well that ends well? Not exactly. As is too often the case, when it comes to his own candidacy, Trump is an unreliable narrator. The New York Times reported: A Harris campaign official also confirmed with NBC News that negotiations are still underway over microphone rules. In other words, the GOP nominee told the public that the debate over the debates had been resolved, which came as something of a surprise to members of Team Harris, who knew better. For those who might benefit from a refresher, Trump initially agreed to a debate schedule three months ago, which included a Sept. 10 event on ABC News. That, of course, was when the former president assumed his opponent would be President Joe Biden. After the Democratic incumbent passed the torch to Harris, Trump abandoned his “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping and took a variety of clumsy steps to back out of his earlier debate commitments. In fact, three weeks ago, Team Trump made what appeared to be a categorical announcement: The GOP candidate would not participate in ABC News’ Sept. 10 presidential debate. Seven days after backing out of the debate, however, Trump reversed course and re-accepted the invitation. Around the same time, the former president held a Mar-a-Lago press conference in which he also announced the dates of other upcoming debates that hadn’t been negotiated and therefore might not occur. Two days later, on Aug. 11, Trump published a middle-of-the-night missive to his social media platform, further alerting the public to a made-up debate schedule, pointing to events that no one had agreed to. Earlier this week, the former president took all of this in an even weirder direction, signaling his newfound reluctance to participate in the Sept. 10 debate. As members of his campaign team worked behind the scenes to keep microphones muted during the event, the Republican candidate himself said he didn’t much care either way, necessarily undermining his own team in public. He added that he believed ABC News should be “shut out” of the process. Two days later, Trump agreed to the terms of the ABC News event — but he did so in a way that wasn’t altogether true. All of which is to say, the first Harris-Trump debate could be two weeks away, or it might not happen at all. The GOP nominee told the public that the underlying disputes had been resolved, but he apparently made that up, and negotiations over the relevant details are still ongoing. I’m reluctant to guess whether the event will actually happen, though one thing seems obvious: The former president was desperate to share a stage with Biden, and he appears genuinely afraid of Harris. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
91,Kamala Harris is right to not make her race and gender a rallying cry,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-policy-identity-trump-attacks-rcna168255,"Vice President Kamala Harris has embraced a variety of vibes during her still nascent 2024 campaign, but one area where she restrains herself is discussing her race and gender. She doesn’t mention it much on the campaign trail. During her nomination speech at the Democratic National Convention, she declined to call attention to those identities outside the typical introduction politicians give when describing where they come from. In recent campaign ads, Harris is described as the middle-class “daughter of a working mom.” The class description renders her ordinary, and there is no attempt to pique interest over the historic implications of her candidacy as a woman of color. Harris’ reluctance to draw extra attention to her womanhood or her Black and South Asian ancestry has stood in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. At the Democratic National Convention that year, a video screen displayed a montage of all past presidents, and then Clinton emerged to the sound of shattering glass. “I can’t believe we have just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet!” she said in the video, prompting the crowd to erupt into roars. During her nomination acceptance speech, she wore a white pantsuit in a nod to the suffragettes, and she trumpeted how her nomination marked a “milestone” for women. Clinton’s most memorable campaign slogan, “I’m With Her,” highlighted her gender — and nothing else. Harris’ choice to go a different path is wise — and she should stay the course. The uniqueness of her identity as a presidential candidate is self-evident, and she should continue to let Republicans, who’ve come up with a preposterous new birther theory, hang themselves with their own rope with their bigoted fixation on her gender and racial background. But beyond tactical questions, Harris’ lack of interest in drawing attention to the “historic” nature of her candidacy is substantively appropriate, too. Harris’ victory wouldn’t in and of itself usher in widespread change for people from marginalized backgrounds. Only policies can do that. This isn’t an argument that Harris should conceal or whitewash her identity. Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, should feel free to discuss and cherish any aspect of her background, just as any citizen in our multicultural democracy should feel free to. And if the context calls for it, it makes sense for her to elucidate how her identity helps explain her ideological outlook. Harris did this artfully in her DNC speech by recounting how her mother, a “5-foot-tall brown woman with an accent,” was sometimes mistreated but “never lost her cool” and taught Harris to “never complain about injustice but do something about it.” Her recollection of another lesson from her mother hints at her own “show, don’t tell” attitude toward discussing her identity: “‘Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are.’”      "
92,The prosecutor populism of Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 16:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-campaign-proposals-prosecutor-rcna168232,"Vice President Kamala Harris is leaning on her decades as a local and state prosecutor to signal her toughness in the presidential race. But that professional experience also shapes her approach to tackling the country's problems. Consider inflation, which has been one of the Biden administration's thorniest political problems. In a speech this month, Harris proposed going after grocery chains that she claimed are using inflation as a pretext to price-gouge consumers. In one line in the speech, she outlined an approach that you might call prosecutorial populism: target the rule-breakers. “Most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case,” she said. You can see echoes of this approach in Harris' Democratic National Convention acceptance speech and other policy announcements: In each case, Harris clearly identified villains and proposed, essentially, prosecuting the cases against them. The benefits of this approach are that it's easy to explain to voters and it forces the political opposition to defend some pretty indefensible behavior. There's a reason defense attorneys have such bad reputations, after all. The populist approach would be to go after the large conglomerates in unflinching language — “every billionaire is a policy failure,” for example — but this prosecutor’s populism is narrower. The large companies breaking the rules are the target, and the solution is to go after them and leave the rest alone. There are limits to this approach. Sometimes a problem doesn't have a clear villain. Sometimes focusing on the people explicitly breaking the rules overlooks the broader problem that the rules created in the first place. Sure, scammy for-profit colleges are bad, but they aren’t the major reason student debt has become such a crippling problem. The prosecutor's mindset can also lead to a focus on easy wins. Being a prosecutor is an inherently political job, but it has much different set of incentives from other positions such as governor or senator. At the local and state levels, prosecutors are typically elected, and many look at their win-loss ratios in court as the best way to persuade voters to re-elect them. That can make them risk-averse, looking for cases with overwhelming evidence or seeking plea deals to avoid the uncertainty of going to trial. That could be a problem for Harris in the White House, where presidents often have to make snap decisions with incomplete information, such as when Barack Obama approved the late-night mission to kill Osama bin Laden. America has had presidents who were prosecutors before. Both James K. Polk and William McKinley got their starts as local prosecutors, and Bill Clinton was Arkansas attorney general before serving as governor. But Harris' experience is much deeper: She was a deputy district attorney, district attorney and California attorney general for 27 years, while she has been a senator and vice president for only seven years. Other presidents have been shaped by their past careers. Ronald Reagan approached the presidency like another acting gig and viewed political problems through the lens of Hollywood screenplays. Obama sometimes sounded like he was still a constitutional law professor, debating with himself whether the president has the power to mint a trillion-dollar coin. And former President Donald Trump still thinks like a real estate developer, promising to build walls and airports and statuary gardens. Harris has leaned heavily on her past as a prosecutor, promising to make the case against Trump, using “for the people” as her campaign slogan and talking about her handling of difficult cases to signal toughness to voters. It has also been used against her, as when some on the left criticized her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign with the meme ""Kamala is a cop."" But based on her policy announcements so far, it's clear that being a prosecutor is more than just a credential for Harris. It's also a mindset that she'll carry with her into the White House."
93,"Trump targets Harris, Walz with entirely made-up claims",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 11:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-targets-kamala-harris-tim-walz-claims-election-2024-rcna168458,"At a campaign event in Arizona late last week, Donald Trump spent a predictable amount of time targeting Vice President Kamala Harris, specifically telling his supporters, “Nobody lies like her. She is a liar. She makes up crap.” The Republican’s rhetoric was rather ironic. After all, the former president is not only the most prolific liar in recent memory, he makes stuff up on a daily basis. Indeed, minutes after insisting that the Democratic nominee “makes up crap,” Trump told the same audience that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “approved a bill to give tampons in every young man’s bathroom.” In reality, Walz did no such thing. In a speech in which the GOP candidate complained about campaign dishonesty, he peddled campaign dishonesty. Two days later, Team Trump released a campaign ad that insisted the Biden/Harris administration has “literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips.” As a Washington Post fact-check report explained, that didn’t happen. Note, this wasn’t an off-hand and unscripted comment at a rally; the Trump campaign carefully included this specific phrasing in a paid television ad. The Republican operation almost certainly knew the claim was baseless, but the former president and his 2024 team pushed it anyway. A day later, Trump spoke at the National Guard Association’s conference and took care to blame Harris for America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago, despite the fact that (a) it wasn’t Harris’ call, (b) Trump’s the one who negotiated the withdrawal agreement, and (c) his own White House national security adviser said Trump bears some responsibility for what transpired. All of which leaves the political world with an awkward question: If Harris and Walz are as awful as Republicans claim, shouldn’t Trump be able to make a compelling case against them without making stuff up? Shouldn’t it be easy for the GOP nominee and his allies to stick to reality-based critiques? Doesn't the fact that the former president has to rely so heavily on dishonesty reinforce the idea that maybe Harris and Walz aren’t so bad after all?"

On the one hand, Donald Trump picked up support from independent conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which didn’t seem to bother Democrats at all. Around the same time, Kamala Harris and her team said they would see the RFK Jr. endorsement and raise Team Trump with a dozen Republican White House lawyers who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, each of whom are now supporting the Democratic nominee. This week, something similar happened. Trump picked up backing from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, at which point members of Team Harris again said they’d see the former congresswoman’s endorsement and raise Trump a whole lot more of bipartisan support. USA Today reported: If this sounds at all familiar, President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign received similar backing from former Bush, McCain, and Romney staffers four years ago. The difference is, the number is even larger now. “We reunite today, joined by new George H.W. Bush alumni, to reinforce our 2020 statements and, for the first time, jointly declare that we’re voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz this November,” the letter reads. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.” These new endorsements, eagerly touted by the Democratic nominee’s campaign, came on the heels of Harris also picking up a variety of other Republican endorsements and Democrats including some GOP speakers at the party’s convention in Chicago. To be sure, there’s room for debate about the electoral impact of announcements like these, but don’t be too quick to overlook the broader context. Trump continues to insist, on a daily basis, that the vice president is a radical communist hellbent on destroying the American way of life. It’s against that backdrop that hundreds of Republicans, who’ve held public office and/or served in GOP administrations, keep coming forward to effectively remind the electorate just how wrong the former president’s attacks are."
