Trump again calls for flag-burning punishment: 'We'll make it constitutional',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 8:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-first-amendment-supreme-court-rcna168381,"Donald Trump is still calling for a punishment that violates the Constitution: jailing people who burn the American flag. It’s been one of the Republican presidential nominee’s consistent proposals this election cycle. Trump just pushed the idea again Monday while speaking in Detroit to the National Guard Association of the United States. “You burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year,” the former president said, adding: “We gotta do it. ... They say, ‘Sir, that’s unconstitutional.’ We’ll make it constitutional.”  The “they” who said that’s unconstitutional was a Supreme Court majority that included conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That hasn’t stopped Trump from advocating the idea after protests outside the Israeli consulate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week and in Washington, D.C., last month during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address.    As for “mak[ing] it constitutional,” we were reminded last month how hard it is to amend the Constitution when President Joe Biden proposed an amendment in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in Trump v. United States. Of course, as we saw in the immunity case, an easier route to accomplish Republican legal goals is by going through the justices themselves — though there isn’t a flag-burning case before the high court currently presenting that opportunity.

Republicans eye 'parallel' probe of Trump assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 8:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-eye-parallel-probe-trump-assassination-attempt-rcna168410,"On the surface, Republicans had reason to be pleased by the congressional response to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. In the House, for example, both parties’ leaders quickly came to an agreement to create a bipartisan investigatory task force — featuring seven Republican and six Democratic lawmakers — and it was approved unanimously. What’s more, House Speaker Mike Johnson chose several far-right election deniers and conspiracy theorists to serve on the panel, which has wasted no time getting to work, despite the fact that Congress is on its summer break. Indeed, task force members have already traveled to the scene of the Pennsylvania shooting for a first-hand examination. And yet, some GOP members still aren’t pleased. Politico reported: “So myself and Cory Mills are leading a parallel investigation into what happened on J-13th and the assassination attempt,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said on a podcast last week, referring to the July 13 shooting. “And we’re doing that because, like many of your listeners, we don’t trust the federal government to actually do the job necessary.” Crane, incidentally, recently told a conservative media outlet, in reference to the shooting, “I don’t put it past some of the people in our government, their willingness to do anything to get rid of President Donald Trump.” Just so we’re all clear, the idea that House GOP leaders chose “serious” Republicans to serve on the task force is a difficult idea to take seriously. The speaker tapped Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, for example, and he’s an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee is also on the panel, despite being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and despite the fact that his right-wing background was so controversial in 2017 that the Senate wouldn’t confirm him when Trump nominated him to serve as secretary of the Army. The task force will be chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who, in addition to being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, is also up to his ears in the fake elector scandal; has accused Barack Obama of running a secret “shadow government”; and initially responded to the assassination attempt by describing it without evidence as an “attack from the left.” Perhaps most notable of all is Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana — an election denier who’s also taken a leading role in concocting deeply weird conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, including bizarre allegations related to the FBI and “ghost buses.” As a recent New York Times report summarized, “Even by a conspiracy theorist’s standards, the wild claims made by Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, stand out.” Johnson, eyeing “serious” members, nevertheless tapped Higgins for the congressional investigation. And yet, Crane and Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida have apparently concluded that the task force’s GOP members aren’t quite unhinged enough, necessitating a “parallel” examination. As a result, the public should expect to eventually see two reports: one from a bipartisan task force led by far-right Republicans, and another from a partisan task force led by even-further-to-the-right Republicans. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why does Trump want a Space National Guard and an ‘Iron Dome’?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-want-space-national-guard-iron-dome-rcna168396,         
"Republicans find new, unfortunate ways to reward fake electors",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 6:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-find-new-unfortunate-ways-reward-fake-electors-rcna168383,"Common sense might suggest that the Republican Party’s fake electors from the 2020 elections would be politically radioactive in the GOP. It’s apparently not working out that way, however. Take the latest developments in Michigan, for example. The Detroit News reported: Among the 15 are a half-dozen fake electors from four years ago. Ahead of the local vote, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, chair of Michigan Republican Party, denounced efforts to hold the fake electors legally accountable, insisting that the alleged criminals have been “singled out potentially very unfairly.” The comments were bizarre, as was the state GOP’s willingness to choose so many fake electors to serve as presidential electors again this year. But stepping back, the problem isn’t just that Republicans rewarded fake electors, the problem is made worse by the fact that Republicans keep rewarding fake electors. In case anyone needs a refresher, after Trump’s defeat, Republicans in several states created forged election materials, pretending to be “duly elected and qualified electors” and sent the documents to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Archivist, among others, as if the fake materials were legitimate. They were not. These Republicans came to be known as their party’s “fake electors.” The larger criminal scandal surrounding their scheme has racked up indictment totals unseen since Watergate and Iran-Contra. In theory, GOP officials should be embarrassed by the entire controversy. In practice, the party is leaning into its own mess. We learned in May, for example, that several fake electors in Nevada were elected to serve as delegates to the Republican National Convention, even after they were criminally charged. “Clearly, lessons learned,” The Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston said sarcastically in response to the news. A month earlier, state prosecutors in Arizona indicted 18 Republicans as part of the party’s fake elector scheme, resulting in allegations of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. Some of them were chosen as convention delegates, too. After the state GOP made the decision, The Arizona Republic’s Laurie Roberts summarized in a column, “The Arizona Republican Party on Saturday sent a flat out, full-throated, flabbergasting message to the voters of this great state. We be crazy, they proclaimed.” Last month, CNN reported that Republicans from seven battleground states agreed to send “fake electors and others who worked to upend the 2020 election results to represent their state parties at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.” Not all of the fake electors who served as convention delegates were under criminal indictment — but some were, and the party didn’t seem to care. It’s against this backdrop that Michigan Republicans backed indicted fake electors, too. As the criminal charges piled up, it seemed implausible that GOP officials would extend rewards to those who were caught serving as fake electors. And yet, here we are.

"Trump calls his former chief of staff a ‘terrible, stupid person’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-calls-former-chief-staff-terrible-stupid-person-rcna168369,"Donald Trump added to his unfortunate record of disparaging military service two weeks ago when the former president said the Presidential Medal of Freedom was “much better” than the Medal of Honor — comments the Veterans of Foreign Wars, among others, described as “asinine.” Former Trump chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, a fierce critic of his former boss, agreed. “The two awards cannot be compared in any way,” he told CNN. “Not even close.” A week later, the GOP presidential nominee returned fire. The New York Times reported: In case it weren’t quite enough that Trump referred to his own former White House chief of staff as “one of the dumbest people” he’s ever met, in the same interview, the Republican called Kelly a “lowlife” and a “terrible, stupid person.” With 10 weeks remaining before Election Day, Trump is directing some of his harshest criticisms at the retired Marine general he tapped to oversee the Department of Homeland Security and his own White House. Indeed, this latest offensive extends one of the strangest ongoing feuds in contemporary American politics. Circling back to our earlier coverage, it was just two months ago when Trump, unprompted, lashed out at Kelly as “dumb” and a “lost soul.” Months earlier, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” There was no great mystery as to the motivation for the offensive. After all, Kelly is the one who confirmed on the record that Trump really did denigrate American servicemembers as “suckers and losers.” “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly told CNN in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. I continue to believe the fact that the Republican nominee is publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign.

Michigan sheriff reportedly faces a state investigation over Trump’s campaign event in Howell,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-howell-michigan-sheriff-mike-murphy-investigation-rcna168312,"A Michigan sheriff who hosted Donald Trump last week reportedly is facing an investigation over complaints that the event violated the state’s campaign finance law. Trump’s choice of Howell, Michigan, was controversial in and of itself, given that he was visiting shortly after white supremacists gathered there and celebrated him and Adolf Hitler. But the props at the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office event — including law enforcement officers and sheriff’s vehicles carefully staged in the background — were just as disturbing as the location. And they gave the impression that the sheriff’s office was endorsing the GOP presidential nominee, despite Sheriff Mike Murphy’s insistence beforehand that it would be a news conference and not a political event. On Thursday, the Detroit Metro Times reported that two complaints filed over the event have prompted the state’s Bureau of Elections to investigate whether Murphy violated the Michigan Campaign Finance Act. An attorney told local outlet MLive that the sheriff could potentially skirt legal trouble by allowing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to speak in the same setting. And Murphy — who denied having committed any violation — told the outlet he would “extend her the same courtesy for sure.” Indeed, inviting Harris (no matter her response) may help the sheriff elude legal consequences, but it doesn’t address the ethical — and I’d argue moral — dilemma that his office has created. Nor does it address the legitimacy crisis that Murphy has unleashed. At last week’s event, Murphy’s officers stood behind Trump as he rambled and falsely accused Harris and the Democratic Party of letting crime run rampant, claims that don’t align with reality. So the essence of Trump’s speech wasn’t just a lie — it was a lie told by a criminal in his own right, one who has fomented an insurrection in which police officers were beaten, and who also has backed policing practices — such as stop and frisk — that have been used to prey upon Black and Latino people disproportionately. And yet members of the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office lent Trump their gravitas by literally backing him up as he told this lie. It begs the question: Why should the local residents trust these officers to protect their rights, if the department was so willing to let them be aligned with one of the most notorious lawbreakers in American history? Can a law enforcement officer legitimately claim to uphold the Constitution after appearing alongside a man who has proposed “termination” of some of it? To be sure, these aren’t merely questions for the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office; many other officers across the nation also have posed with Trump since his election loss in 2020. All of them seemingly without a care in the world for the grim message it sends to the residents they encounter daily — that they care about power and control more than law and order."
Ron DeSantis' anti-woke crusade just suffered a humiliating defeat,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ron-desantis-anti-woke-school-boards-rcna167958,"Florida was supposed to be where “woke goes to die,” as Gov. Ron DeSantis is fond of saying. But last week he suffered a humiliating defeat, as only six of the 23 school board candidates he endorsed won in races across the state. Eleven were defeated outright, while a half-dozen more races remain undecided.  A columnist for The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville put the matter succinctly: “DeSantis is out of juice.” The guy compared by some pundits to Ronald Reagan only a couple of years ago found his Waterloo in ... the Tampa burbs. Those results came as Democrats gathered in Chicago to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris for president. The eyes of the nation weren’t on Tallahassee, in other words, yet the Florida school board outcomes — as minor as they may seem — say something significant about our national politics, about the profound thirst of most Americans for a pragmatic politics that doesn’t cater to the fringe or play on our resentments. As one social media user put it, “Florida wants moderates not MAGA.” With former President Donald Trump continuing to struggle to define Harris and starting to show significant slippage in some polls, the same may be true of the country at large. The striking number of Republicans who spoke at the Democratic convention is more evidence of that trend. According to The Associated Press, 83% of DeSantis school board nominees won in 2022. This time around, he will be lucky to break 50% after runoffs in November.  The governor’s supporters will surely blame “the woke mind virus,” but that’s just an excuse for the failed attempt to install right-wing ideologues in and around Tampa (Pinellas and Hillsborough counties), among other parts of the state. In South Florida’s Broward County, two DeSantis appointees were ousted. One of his school board candidates lost in a district that every Republican presidential candidate since John McCain in 2008 has won, according to Andrew Pantazi, editor of the scrappy Jacksonville outlet The Tributary.     Faced with this defeat at the hands of voters, DeSantis simply appointed one of the Broward losers to the state Board of Education. The candidates DeSantis endorsed were also boosted by Moms for Liberty, a sophisticated Christian nationalist outfit disguised as a kaffeeklatsch of well-meaning suburban ladies worried about their children reading Anne Frank’s diary. They successfully pushed to ban an illustrated version of that book, among many others: Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” and Judy Blume’s “Forever,” to name just two flagrant examples. DeSantis calls this “freedom.”  Punishing the Disney Corp. for speaking out in favor of LGBTQ rights was “freedom,” too. Removing elected prosecutors because he disagrees with their positions on abortion rights? DeSantis did that in the name of freedom, too. Because only he understands the true nature of the threat: “groomer” teachers and drag queens trying to “convert” children, George Soros-funded prosecutors opening up the prisons and letting criminals run wild, the corporate media (except Fox News) brainwashing you into believing the sea level around Miami is rising because of some liberal fantasy called “climate change.” Floridians told DeSantis that they aren’t stupid. They don’t need his heavy hand in choosing local educators — or prosecutors.  And they certainly don’t want to be bullied by Moms of Liberty, which wants Americans to read “The Making of America,” a deranged tract that effectively glorifies slavery. It asks parents to take a pledge in favor of a “moral upbringing” for children. (Its co-founder Bridget Ziegler and her husband, Christian — a former Florida GOP chair — are embroiled in numerous scandals, including one involving an alleged ménage à trois.) DeSantis rose to prominence with his opposition to coronavirus lockdowns and business closures. In the fall of 2020, he fought to open schools across the state, even as many Democrats argued it was unsafe to do so. DeSantis turned out to be correct, and he began to earn national attention. As so often happens to be the case, the seductions of fame, the whispers about a presidential run, proved impossible to resist. To stay in the news, DeSantis had to keep making news, which he did by taking ever more extreme positions: on vaccines, masks, education, corporations, climate change, race. But his brief foray into presidential politics was a debacle of historic proportions, which began with a bungled social media rollout and ended amid speculation about whether the governor wore high heels (yes, he does). The same conventional wisdom that had compared DeSantis to Reagan argued that he lost because Trump took up so much room. And that was true to an extent. But it was clear — as it was once again in last Tuesday’s results — that the American people have no interest in his joyless, ideological style of politics. Still, the guy keeps trying, as if the problem were that he isn’t cruel and vindictive enough. DeSantis recently proposed to open Florida parks to development. Because, you know, Florida doesn’t have enough golf courses or strip malls. The plan met with what the AP described as “widespread opposition across the political spectrum,” and it appears to be already falling apart, with a key backer pulling out. It was classic DeSantis, equal parts mean and inept. Whatever the people of Florida voted for when they elected him, they did not vote for this."

"Jack Smith could win his appeal, but still have to deal with Judge Cannon",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 4:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-judge-aileen-cannon-classified-documents-rcna168242,"Special counsel Jack Smith filed his brief to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, urging the court to reverse U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case. The Justice Department has a decent chance of prevailing, but reviving the case alone won’t solve a continuing challenge Smith would still face: Cannon herself. In her latest avant-garde move in the former president’s favor, the Trump appointee tossed the federal case last month on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded. In his appellate brief, the special counsel highlights how much of an outlier Cannon’s ruling was. Noting the longtime acceptance of special counsels, the government wrote that Cannon’s “contrary view conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the Attorney General has such authority, and it is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government.” Recall that, before the former president was charged in this case, the 11th Circuit had already rebuked Cannon’s eccentrically Trump-friendly handling of litigation stemming from the Mar-a-Lago search warrant in 2022. That raised questions when Cannon was randomly assigned to the criminal case last year about whether she could be removed. The short answer is that, as I’ve written before during this saga, it’s more difficult to reassign a judge than you might think, and we shouldn’t assume that that will happen here, absent the judge doing something even more outlandish than she has to date. Smith’s brief didn’t indicate his intention to seek a new judge. That doesn’t mean that the appeals court couldn’t still remove her while reversing her, but there’s reason to not expect that here. One thing to keep in mind is how Cannon arrived at her ruling. She cited, among other things, Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion in the Trump immunity case, in which the Republican appointee went out of his way to question Smith’s appointment. That wasn’t the issue in the immunity case, so we don’t know how many other justices (if any) agree with Thomas. But it would seemingly make it more difficult to kick a judge off a case in part for reaching a decision citing a sitting Supreme Court justice’s reasoning, however flawed that reasoning is. Of course, if the high court ultimately upholds Cannon’s ruling if the case gets to the justices, that would moot any reassignment issue — as would a Trump presidential victory in November, which could lead to him eliminating the case entirely. That’s all to say that even if Smith succeeds in his current task (something we won’t know the answer to for a while), the case will remain on unsteady ground so long as Cannon presides. And given the great discretion afforded trial court judges, including during their handling of trials themselves, there’d be plenty more opportunity for mischief if the case goes back to her. But at the moment, that might be Smith’s best realistic outcome.   Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

This aspect of Louisiana’s abortion ban is deliberately vague — and deliberately cruel,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 3:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-louisiana-abortion-ban-kaitlyn-joshua-liz-murrill-rcna168301,"On the opening night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, Kaitlyn Joshua, a resident of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was one of three women who walked onto the main stage at the United Center and described for the country how she almost lost her life to a miscarriage in 2022. She was getting ready for her daughter’s “fourth birthday party,” she said, when something didn’t feel right. “Two emergency rooms sent me away because of Louisiana’s abortion ban.” Joshua continued: “No one would confirm that I was miscarrying. I was in pain, bleeding so much that my husband feared for my life. No woman should experience what I endured. But too many have. They write to me saying, ‘What happened to you happened to me.’ Sometimes they’re miscarrying and are scared to tell anyone. Even their doctors. Our daughters deserve better. America deserves better.” Joshua’s story warrants our sympathy, and our outrage, but in response, Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, demonstrating that Republicans are terrified of the consequences of their abortion bans being known, essentially called Joshua a liar. In a post that same night on X, Murrill wrote, “Once again, the Democrats have their facts wrong. There is nothing in our bipartisan law that prohibits emergency care for someone having a miscarriage or any emergency situation during pregnancy. Nothing. Hard stop.” In a second post, Murrill wrote that “doctors are legally required to care for a pregnant woman who suffers an emergent health crisis, whether that’s appendicitis or a miscarriage.” No matter what Murrill wants the world to believe, the truth is Joshua suffered because of the abortion ban that went into effect in Louisiana after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It’s not at all surprising to hear Joshua say two Louisiana hospitals refused to treat her. In fact, it’s predictable. Doctors and hospital officials across Louisiana have repeatedly confirmed that our vague laws on this “life of the mother” exception are causing dangerous problems, and medical officials are afraid of providing care for a woman having a miscarriage and then being arrested and charged. The law requires a person to essentially be on her deathbed before allowing the exception. Those doctors should be afraid. In June 2022, five days after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 6-3 to overturn Roe, Murrill, then a chief deputy to Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, drafted a letter for Landry that he sent the Louisiana State Medical Society. A physician who performed an “elective” abortion, that Murrill/Landry letter said, would risk their “liberty and medical license.” They said that! It’s telling that instead of clarifying the new law, they threatened to arrest doctors and end their careers. After Murrill essentially accused Joshua of lying on X, the Louisiana Right to Life also posted to bring attention to the state’s “life of the mother” exception and wrote, “Ultimately, the fault for the substandard treatment lies with the practitioners that managed her case.” That post accused the DNC of “utilizing a tragic story to elicit confusion and disapproval for pro-life laws.” One wonders if Murrill would prosecute a physician who did not terminate a pregnancy when the woman’s life was in danger. Is the worth of a woman’s life now to be decided by politicians? What women like Joshua know, and what Murrill and the Louisiana Right to Life don’t want to admit, is that we have unusable laws, drafted purposely to prevent any abortion, for any reason. Hospitals and doctors are terrified of arrest, so they err on the side of virtually no treatment for miscarriage and complications. So many women have come forward with their painful stories. The Department of Health has publicly referred questions on abortion to Murrill, the highest ranking prosecutor in the state. Those are the facts. If the powerful in the state cared about women’s lives, then they’d pass a law to clarify the exceptions related to health and life of the mother and a nonviable fetus. (Soon after the ban went into effect, Nancy Davis, another Baton Rouge woman, found out her fetus was developing without a skull, and had to travel to New York for an abortion because she couldn’t get care in Louisiana.) Yet every time legislators have tried to do this, Louisiana Right to Life, which is politically powerful, has crushed those efforts. They think that women and doctors lie. It’s easier to punish someone when the law is vague. This demeaning treatment of women is not new, and it certainly is bipartisan. Former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and his wife ran hard on a campaign of “life,” judging and punishing women who choose to terminate a pregnancy. Edwards signed every abortion-related law that landed on his desk. He signed the 2022 trigger ban, even though it would have become law without his signature, that did not include a rape and incest exception that he claimed he supported. He noted in an interview that prior to Roe being overturned, the abortion debate in the Louisiana legislature was “largely an academic exercise,” meaning the cruelty it would inflict upon women was only theoretical and something officials could never be held accountable for. But now we’re seeing those consequences play out in real life. Louisiana is often described as “last in everything.” Maybe it’s because we treat women — some women — as expendable, political pawns. Dragging Kaitlyn Joshua in the media for telling her truth is how the attorney general, Landry's administration and Louisiana Right to Life think they can defend the indefensible. In response to Louisiana Right to Life’s social media thread blaming the hospitals Joshua visited — and not Louisiana law — for her suffering, Joshua responded, “They are scared y’all. Instead of Right to Life using their platform to amplify the issues around the same ban they endorsed, that is STILL comprising basic maternal care in our state, instead of owning the harm they caused and the confusion they created, they do this!!!”  They are scared. They’re scared of the public knowing that this is what total abortion bans mean, and scared of Joshua telling women: what happened to me could happen to you. "
This DOJ lawsuit is just one of several good signs for exhausted renters and homeowners,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 2:33 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-rising-rent-control-plan-rcna168286,"Our homes are supposed to offer us shelter from the troubles of the world, but over the past two decades, they’ve increasingly become a place where greater economic forces batter millions of Americans. First, the Great Recession’s foreclosure crisis saw 10 million homeowners lose their homes between 2007 and 2014. Now we are experiencing a housing affordability crisis. Rents are up 30% since early 2020, while home prices have jumped 47%.  But, finally, it appears there might be some relief at hand. Recent announcements from the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department and Vice President Kamala Harris all, in their own way, tackle the problem that’s left millions of Americans struggling to find a place to call their own. Help can’t come soon enough. A record number of Americans are rent-burdened — that is, spending 30% or more of their income on housing costs. At the same time, the cost of buying a home is soaring. That’s good news for the 65 million Americans who own their own residences — to this day, housing remains the greatest source of wealth for a majority of Americans — but bad news for those seeking to gain a foothold in property ownership. The traditional — and overly simplified — explanation for rising housing costs is that the U.S. is short millions of houses, townhouses and apartments. Those lucky enough to own their residence, according to this line of thought, selfishly fight any development near their homes, restricting supply and sending prices soaring. As wannabe owners have an increasingly hard time affording a home, they remain stuck in the rental market, increasing demand. While there is something to these beliefs, the reality is a bit more complex. One complication is apparent in the lawsuit the Justice Department and eight states filed Friday against software company RealPage. The private equity-owned company provides revenue management software for landlords and controls an estimated 80% of that market. Landlords would report on their rental units to RealPage, which would, in turn, possessing nonpublic data detailing what competitors were charging, spit out a recommended rental price. The government alleges this service amounts to a form of illegal collusion, updated for the web 3.0 era. The lawsuit uses RealPage’s own words to make the point, noting the company claimed, “Our tool insures that [landlords] are driving every possible opportunity to increase price in even the most downward trending or unexpected conditions.” Lower rents, on the other hand, would be of enormous help to millions of Americans. According to the lawsuit, the percentage of household income spent on rent by Americans without a college degree increased from 30% in 2000 to 42% in 2017. Unsurprisingly, RealPage denies the charges. But, privately, both its own executives and its satisfied customers beg to differ. “I always liked this product because your algorithm uses proprietary data from other subscribers to suggest rents and term. That’s classic price-fixing,” one landlord wrote in an email cited in the lawsuit. One of the company’s vice presidents touted the company’s software as discouraging clients “trying to compete against one other.” The Justice Department’s lawsuit came on the heels of Vice President Kamala Harris unveiling her plan to boost homeownership and real estate construction. In that plan, the Democratic nominee backs Senate Democrats’ bill deeming RealPage’s business model illegal, but there’s much more. The Harris administration — if, that is, there is a Harris administration — is aiming for 3 million new residences by the end of her first term. She would provide financial assistance and tax breaks to real-estate investors who target first-time home buyers, and encourage states and localities to reduce bureaucratic barriers to building. And she’d also seek to expand a tax credit available to low-income renters, while ending tax policies that incentivize Wall Street-backed corporations snapping up single-family homes. That’s all well and good, but people still need to afford the financing of these homes — which brings us to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s declaration Friday that “the time has come” for the central bank to cut interest rates. That means the rise in mortgage interest rates, which began when the Fed hiked interest rates during 2022 and 2023, may finally be ending. It’s not just that high interest rates put a crimp in housing starts for both single family and multi-unit residences, which dropped to a four-year low in July. Because many homeowners locked in mortgages with interest rates in the low single digits before 2022, the sharp increase since has kept them effectively locked in place, unable to upgrade or downsize without taking a significant financial hit. As a result, housing inventory for sale remains near historic lows, helping fuel record high prices. Hopefully, the interest rate drop will prompt some of those homeowners into selling — and get some of those unhappy renters into a home of their own. Housing is a basic human right, but all too often housing policy gets left on the back burner. All these actions combined should begin to shift the balance of power away from those lucky enough to already own a bit of real estate, and back toward those seeking to get a foothold, whether as homeowners or renters. It can’t happen soon enough."

RFK Jr.'s endorsement of Donald Trump confirms what we've suspected all along,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-donald-trump-endorsement-kennedy-conspiracy-rcna168287,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 25 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Shunned by Democrats and estranged from his family, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been desperate for validation. So desperate, in fact, that he has now joined forces with Donald Trump.  Of course, as the most prolific anti-vax conspiracy theorist in the country, Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump was a long time coming. Frankly, the two have a lot in common: Both have enormous egos that cloud their judgment, both rely on misinformation to prey on people’s fears, and both leverage their last name for their own self-interest. But for Kennedy, this endorsement also marks another act of rebellion against his family and the institutions they helped build. Although he shares the same name as his father, he could not be more different.  His dad — the original Robert Kennedy — was driven by a genuine concern for the health and welfare of the American people. He was a champion of the underprivileged and the vulnerable. He appealed to people’s better angels, not their worst instincts.  When it came to modern medicine, he said those with power and influence have a duty to aid the less fortunate. As Kennedy told a group of doctors in Indiana in 1968, “We have to recognize those of us who have the advantages that you have and that I have that we have an obligation of responsibility to those who do not.” In other words, Kennedy believed that it was not enough to merely ""do no harm"" — he felt strongly that people in a position to help others have an obligation to do so.   Needless to say, the apple has fallen pretty far from the tree. Kennedy has not only failed in his “obligation of responsibility,” he’s actually done the opposite. He’s used his privilege and his name to encourage the most vulnerable Americans to turn their backs on modern medicine. He’s used falsehoods to stoke widespread fear of even routine vaccines, including the vaccines that eradicated measles, mumps and polio. If Trump and Kennedy have their way, parents will once again have to worry that their kids could be susceptible to life-threatening diseases at school.   But here’s the thing: Kennedy is not only insulting his father’s legacy, he’s also trying to sabotage the party that his family has shaped and influenced for more than six decades. Remember, his endorsement comes just days after new reporting showed his candidacy was now costing Trump more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris. We also can’t forget that Kennedy’s political ambitions were, in part, financed by one of Trump’s biggest billionaire donors. By endorsing Trump, Kennedy is simply confirming what we suspected all along: that his goal is to be a spoiler for the Democratic ticket. And while we still don’t know what the real impact of this endorsement will be, we do know that the headlines shouldn’t read: “Kennedy endorses Trump.” They should read: “Dangerous conspiracy theorists join forces.”  Join Jen Psaki, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

Here's what Kamala Harris has to do in high-stakes sit-down interview,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-tim-walz-interview-donald-trump-rcna168274,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 25 episode of ""Alex Witt Reports."" This week, Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to sit down for her first interview as a presidential candidate. Since entering the race, Harris has been criticized for her lack of interviews and press conferences. Earlier this month, she promised to sit down for an interview by the end of August. With less than a week to go, NBC News is now reporting Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, will take part in a joint interview in the coming days, though it’s unclear with whom or precisely when that will happen.   This first interview is critically important for the Harris campaign. It could help keep up the incredible momentum she’s built since entering the race. It’s also a very important moment for the country. Republicans and Democrats alike need to see Harris engaged in an interview with a sober, serious reporter. She needs to be asked tough questions and provide answers to the American people — on the record. Have any of her policy positions shifted since she ran for president in 2019? If so, why did those shifts occur? I’m sure she’ll get pressed on her role within the Biden-Harris administration on hot-button issues like immigration and the border. She may even get questions on foreign policy and the Afghanistan withdrawal.   But, in some ways, it’s more about how the vice president answers these questions than the actual answers themselves. There will likely be some uncomfortable moments for Harris, but it’s those moments that are the most important. The American people need to see how she handles being asked tough questions and how she reacts under pressure.  The Trump campaign’s first attack ad against Harris included an exchange between the vice president and NBC News’ Lester Holt during a 2021 interview. When Harris was asked by Holt why she had not visited the border as vice president she quipped back that she had also not been to Europe. Is that the Harris we’ll see this week — defensive under pressure? Or will we see the strength and directness she’s displayed over the last four weeks? "
Trump could be starting to face the music over his campaign’s use of an Isaac Hayes song,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:03 PM PDT / Updated Sept. 4, 2024, 6:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-isaac-hayes-song-hold-on-im-coming-rcna168275,"UPDATE (Sept. 7, 7:15 a.m. ET): A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Donald Trump’s campaign to stop using musician Isaac Hayes’ song “Hold On, I’m Coming,” in response to a lawsuit from the Hayes estate. It looks like Donald Trump could be starting to face the music over his campaign’s unauthorized use of an Isaac Hayes song. As Rolling Stone reported: Isaac Hayes III announced the latest development in a post on X, writing in part: “See you in court.” (Trump does not appear to have publicly commented on the matter.) Trump certainly isn’t the only politician who’s been told to bug off by an artist or their estate after bumping one of their songs at his rallies. But he sure seems to have received more cease-and-desist demands than just about any other candidate. And frankly, while any personal aversion to Trump would be justified, some of these artists’ refusals just sound like good business sense. After all, it’s certainly plausible that a song could lose replay value if it’s viewed as a soundtrack for one — or more — of Trump’s hate-fueled events, during which he has ranted about immigrants and Jewish people, among others. And as the younger Hayes explained to Joy Reid recently, that potential diminution of value could be devastating for estates like his father’s, whose owners have had to work long and hard to gain control of the artist’s songs in the first place. Watch a clip of Joy’s interview with Hayes and his lawyer, James Walker Jr., below."
How racism claims play into Trump's Georgia criminal case appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fani-willis-racism-georgia-election-case-rcna168265,"The issue of race permeates Donald Trump’s Georgia state election interference case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Trump’s latest court filing in a pretrial appeal seeking Willis’ disqualification reminds us that it surfaces in a legal claim, specifically.    At least, the former president — who has harnessed racism for his political ends — wants it to be an issue that kicks Willis off the case or even gets it dismissed.  Recall that, back in March, Judge Scott McAfee declined to force Willis’ removal. The defense had alleged a conflict of interest stemming from her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. McAfee didn’t find an actual conflict but said the appearance of impropriety required Willis or Wade to step down, and the latter did.  Responding to a separate defense claim, relevant to Trump’s new court filing on Monday, McAfee criticized a speech that Willis gave at an Atlanta church whose effect, the judge wrote in his March ruling, “was to cast racial aspersions at an indicted Defendant’s decision to file this pretrial motion.” Yet the trial judge concluded that Willis didn’t cross the line to the point of denying a fair trial or requiring her disqualification. The state criminal case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been on hold pending the appeal, where this issue is the focus of the GOP presidential nominee’s latest filing to Georgia’s state appeals court. “Willis falsely declared that allegations against her stemmed from racism to hide the fact that they were true,” his lawyers wrote of the prosecutor, who is Black. She “obviously intended that every potential Fulton County juror who heard or read Willis’ racist speech should label the defendants as racists,” the lawyers added. While McAfee criticized Willis in his ruling, Trump’s lawyers argued in their appellate filing that “the mere verbal rebuke of Willis by the trial judge was utterly insufficient — it demanded disqualification.” In rejecting the defense claim, McAfee wrote that Georgia law on so-called forensic misconduct is unclear in terms of the relevant standard for determining disqualification. That could make it more of an open question how the courts resolve the appeal, which has been set for oral argument in December. If Willis and her office are disqualified, that would raise questions of when or even whether the case could go forward with a new prosecutor’s office. Defending McAfee’s bottom line in keeping her on the case, Willis’ office wrote earlier this month that the judge didn’t abuse his discretion “in finding that none of the District Attorney’s statements were capable of permanently impairing the fundamental fairness of any future trial and that, as a result, disqualification was not appropriate.” To be sure, this disqualification issue is separate from the underlying substance of the case, in which Trump and others were charged a year ago for their alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election in the state. And there are other issues to resolve before the case can proceed to trial, including the effect of the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling. If Trump is elected in November, more attention may be drawn to his state criminal cases, which presidents don’t have the power to pardon or dismiss, as Trump’s lawyers try to overturn his New York state guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. But whether Trump wins or loses in November, the fate of the Georgia case may not become clear for some time.

"Trump howls as Harris, Dems turn him into the 2024 incumbent",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 11:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-howls-harris-dems-turn-2024-incumbent-rcna168276,"During the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters didn’t literally describe Donald Trump as an incumbent, but it was a message the party was eager to convey. Over the weekend, the former president added text to the subtext. “Kamala and her ‘handlers’ are trying to make it sound like I am the Incumbent President,” the Republican whined early Saturday at 1:15 a.m. He’s not the only one who’s noticed. TPM’s Josh Marshall summarized: I can appreciate why this is exasperating to the GOP nominee and his supporters. Harris is, after all, the incumbent vice president. She’s also the candidate offering American voters a breath of fresh air and a “new way forward,” as the Democrat put it in her convention speech. To a very real degree, Trump brought this on himself, pretending he won the 2020 race, asking that he be described as “Mr. President,” meeting with foreign officials as a matter of course, banishing the word “former” from his title, etc. But there’s more to it than that. As Off Message’s Brian Beutler noted in his latest column: Quite right. Trump grudgingly exited the White House in January 2021, but in the months and years that followed, he not only retook control of his political party, he also remained a dominant voice in the American discourse, en route to cruising through GOP primaries and caucuses, becoming his party’s presidential nominee for the third consecutive cycle. As a legal and official matter, the Republican has no more authority than you or I. He can’t sign or veto bills. He can’t issue executive orders. He is a private citizen with no powers to speak of. But it’s hardly unreasonable to conclude that we’re mired in the Trump era of American politics. And that, in turn, is precisely why Harris has an advantage as the candidate of change. The message to the electorate couldn’t be more straightforward: 2024 offers a unique opportunity to bring the Trump era to an end and usher in something new."
Senate candidate Royce White says suburban women voters are for suckers,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 10:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/royce-white-podcast-suburban-women-rcna168254,"In a recent episode of his aptly named podcast, “Please Call Me Crazy,” GOP Senate candidate Royce White went on a chauvinistic rant demeaning women who live in the suburbs, and labeling Republican politicians who seek these women’s votes as “losers” who have a “cucked mentality.”  He doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo that Donald Trump and his campaign are trying — however haplessly — to soften their image with women voters. Or maybe White is outright defying it. The Minnesota Republican, who’s currently looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, is known for launching bigoted attacks via social media and his podcasts. In July 2023, for example, White told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon that women these days are “too mouthy.”  That remark came up again during a podcast episode released on Thursday, when White doubled down on his “mouthy” remark, claimed Republicans who try to win over suburban women voters are “delusional,"" said these Republicans would be better off caucusing with Democrats, and accused these Republicans of “living in a cucked mentality.” (The term ""cuck,"" in right-wing parlance, is another word for a man perceived as weak — particularly in their interactions with women). It’s worth noting, here, that just last week Trump publicly tried to woo suburban women during a speech that focused on crime. Awkward.  According to White: White said his “too mouthy” comments from last year pale in comparison to the things women are allowed to say about men these days. And then he truly went off the deep end with a chauvinistic rant claiming suburban women can “come along” with the hypermasculine MAGA movement only if they disabuse themselves of what he calls their “strange” psychology. Like many of White’s rants, this one descended into nonsensical schlock invoking geopolitics. He said:  No need to strain yourself trying to make sense of all of that. These are the ramblings of a man who seems to borrow his putrid takes from the darkest and most conspiracy theory-ridden bowels of the internet. And this contrived image of a suburban woman who purportedly tends to overspend on goods simply because they benefit children in Africa is a product of that delusion. But White wasn’t finished.  He continued:  Perhaps, now, it’s starting to make sense why I suspected White’s candidacy might prove disastrous for Minnesota Republicans. He’s never won a general election himself, yet he seems oddly confident the way to do so — in a state with a popular incumbent senator, no less — is to publicly demean suburban women, whose aversion to the GOP’s anti-abortion extremism and its Trumpian character more broadly already seems to be causing trouble for the party’s election hopes.

Jack Smith reportedly won’t seek a ‘mini-trial’ in Trump’s Jan. 6 case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 10:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-mini-trial-trump-jan-6-election-interference-rcna168195,"Special counsel Jack Smith reportedly isn’t planning on seeking a so-called mini-trial in Donald Trump’s federal election interference case before the November election. I’ll explain what that means and why that isn’t the crucial issue in the broader context of the prosecution and Trump’s criminal cases generally. The context that prompted speculation about such a hearing is the Supreme Court’s July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States, which laid out a vague test for presidential immunity that now falls to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to apply, to see how much of Trump’s indictment survives the high court’s ruling (an issue that may well return to the justices for review of her decision before any trial can happen). The question is how Chutkan will seek to accomplish that complex task: With just written briefs? With briefs followed by an expansive hearing featuring witness testimony? It’s not clear yet. The parties have a joint status report due to Chutkan on Friday about how they want to proceed, after Smith notably requested more time to finalize the government’s position, with Trump’s team unsurprisingly agreeing to the further delay. Ahead of that status report coming due, Bloomberg News reported Friday that Smith “has decided against seeking a major hearing to present evidence in the election-interference case against Donald Trump before voters go to the polls,” and The New York Times similarly reported that federal prosecutors “now appear unlikely to seek a broad public airing of their evidence in a courtroom before Election Day.” The reports, which cited people familiar with the matter, have not been independently confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC. But if true, this news isn’t too surprising. After the immunity ruling, it became even clearer that no Jan. 6 trial was going to happen before the election. As shown most recently by Smith requesting more time to determine his position on how to proceed, the government seems to understand that there’s no use in rushing now. So what’s the public missing out on if there isn’t such a hearing before the election? One answer seems to be that voters could learn even more about Trump’s actions after the 2020 presidential election that led to the indictment. (He has pleaded not guilty.) But Jan. 6 isn’t a whodunit. Whatever happens in this criminal case, Trump’s behavior that day is well documented and has been broadcast for all to understand. A federal court hearing (which wouldn’t be televised, by the way) could add more details, but anyone inclined to pay attention has long had abundant information available to them that should make the matter clear for electoral purposes, one way or the other. Perhaps it would be worse politically for Trump if, in the days leading up to the November election, there were additional daily reports of his antidemocratic behavior on this score. But that political issue isn’t the issue in court. The bigger legal issue is that if Trump wins the election, then his federal cases are as good as gone. (Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the former president’s federal classified documents case, to which Trump has also pleaded not guilty, with Smith’s appellate brief due Tuesday.) Voters are free to consider that electing Trump again would mean that he’d never face federal criminal trials for Jan. 6 or his allegedly unlawful retention of classified documents and obstruction. (With state cases, presidents can’t dismiss them or issue pardons; Trump’s lawyers are arguing that the immunity ruling should cause his New York guilty verdicts to be reversed, while his Georgia state case, in which he has pleaded not guilty, is tied up on a pretrial appeal unrelated to immunity.) And the immunity ruling isn’t the only recent high court decision implicating how Trump’s case in Washington moves forward. Another one that Trump’s lawyers will press is Fischer v. United States, in which the court narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. Two of Trump’s four charges in his Jan. 6 indictment are obstruction-related, so even if the Fischer case doesn’t upend Trump’s prosecution to the extent that the immunity decision has and will, it’s yet another issue potentially complicating the case. Again, the case becomes uncomplicated if Trump wins the election, because he’d then be empowered to get rid of the case. In the meantime, of course, it isn’t fully up to Smith or Trump how the case proceeds. It’s up to the judge. We should learn more about where the case is headed when we see the report on Friday, with a status conference set for next week, on Sept. 5, that could shed more light on what’s next.

August 23rd, I’m Claire McCaskill and I’m here with my guest co-pilot today, the “Bulwark’s” one and only Tim Miller, which I’m excited about. He’s funny and he’s good and he’s smart and he used to be a Republican. He’s host of the “Bulwark’s” podcast, which is terrific. You should listen to it. He and Sam Stein did a thing on RFK’s trip with the bear carcass that I sent to everybody I know because I couldn’t stop laughing. Tim Miller: Well, that’s wonderful. That was, I think, the highlight of our whole oomph, so thank you. Claire McCaskill: Oh my god, it was so good. He’s also an MSNBC analyst with me. We traveled together to the debate in Atlanta to talk about that mess. And he’s the author of “Why We Did It,” a travelogue from the Republican road to hell. Good morning, Tim. Tim Miller: Hey, Claire. I was just saying to the suits last night, maybe don’t send me and Claire to the next debate. Maybe just one of us or maybe a new team, a new duo. I’m happy to go wherever, but just let’s change up the juju a little bit. Claire McCaskill: You know, I got to tell you though, I really remember walking away from the building and you telling me that your husband said that I went there and how glad he was that I went there the night after the debate. And when you said that, it was so oddly reassuring to me as somebody who has taken incoming for 40 years as a politician in a really tough state to get that kind of reassurance that I spoke my truth, but I knew a lot of shit was going to fly because of what I’d said. So you just giving me that little bit of reassurance as we were walking late that night was nice. And so tell your husband thank you too. Tim Miller: I will pass that along to him. And I’m happy about that because look at where we are now. We’re in the coconut grove -- Claire McCaskill: I know. Tim Miller: -- and we’re unburdened by what has been. Now, things are wonderful. Claire McCaskill: I’m F’ing drinking pina coladas. I don’t know about you, but it is -- Tim Miller: Same. Me and Jen Psaki we’re having a coconut cocktail last night around 2:15 a.m. Claire McCaskill: Perfect, perfect. We’re also gonna have Cedric Richmond. After Tim and I finished talking, we’re gonna have the former Louisiana congressman and a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair join me to spend a little bit of time unpacking from the campaign’s perspective, what they accomplished and what they are seeing down the road. But let’s first dig into how the week went. We got, you know, less than 75 days, 74 to be exact. I’ve been here since Monday. I thought it would be fun to talk about how it looked from the outside as somebody who’s been to a lot of conventions, certainly some on the Republican side, which I’ve never attended, and then how it felt like on the inside. So let’s start with you. Why don’t you give us what you think was your overall takeaway impression after watching this thing for a week? Tim Miller: Yeah. I mean, number one, you know, we can nitpick and talk about the goods and the bads, but just as a biggest picture, especially the last three nights, phenomenal. They had three weeks to turn this thing around from when she was the nominee. And it’s a lot harder than maybe it seems, you know, it’s like, oh, you have politicians, give speeches. Like there are a lot of pitfalls. And, you know, I think back to the Romney 2012 convention, which was the last Republican one where I was really in good standing with the party and like, we fucked up a couple of things, pretty bad excuse my language. Like there was the Clint Eastwood thing. There was one of the nights it had a weird theme. Claire McCaskill: Well, that was brutal. Everybody needs to remember that was that really bizarre thing. He was out there with an empty chair. (BEGIN AUDIO) Clint Eastwood: So. Mr. President, how do you handle promises that you made when you were running for election? Do you just, you know, I know people were wondering, you don’t -- (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: He was talking to the chair. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, that was not good, Tim. That was not good. Tim Miller: Yeah, I know. So there were multiple nights and Paul Ryan wasn’t really that good at driving a message. So anyway. Just being able to do the minimum in three weeks of drive a clear message, build up Kamala, explain what the contrast is between her and Trump and offer something that’s appealing to a broad swath of Americans. Like that’s a minimum bar and they just cleared it, I think with flying colors. The other thing that just really struck me especially as a former Republican was how much effort was put in across the board by every speaker up to and including the vice president and the presidential nominee to reach out to people from different perspectives politically to say, everyone is welcome here no matter if you’re a conservative. Barack Obama really focusing on how they’re good people, you know, you know these types of people in your life that have these American values and maybe they’ve been Republicans, but they believe in decency and respect and working hard and playing by the rules, all that sort of stuff. And it was in almost every speech, religious tones, focus on patriotism, USA chance, and it was really an effort that culminated in the vice president’s speech last night that said, this is a campaign for everybody and it’s also a campaign for the people in the room, for Democrats, you know, but we’re welcoming everybody to it. And just one observation on that, in her speech last night, she mentioned America or Americans 34 times. She mentioned the Democratic Party zero times. You know, it was really an intentional effort to be as broad and as big as possible and that really came through. Claire McCaskill: Well, and what a contrast between -- Tim Miller: Yes, oh my gosh. Claire McCaskill: -- our convention and the Republican convention, there was no effort. In fact, it was the opposite. Tim Miller: Yes. Claire McCaskill: You almost felt like if you were a woman, you weren’t welcome. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: The Hulk Hogan ripping the shirt, which was beyond weird. I think he was drunk, don’t you? Tim Miller: He was partying. I don’t know. It might just be CTE so, I don’t know. I’m not a doctor. Claire McCaskill: Well, there you go. And Trump coming in, it’s a man’s world and the fact that I have no recollection. There might have been some women speakers that I don’t remember women at all at their convention. Tim Miller: Certainly not the last night. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, no. So it was such a contrast of reaching out. And you’re right. It happened. Tim Miller: Just on that point, could you just imagine? It’s hard to even imagine in your mind a Republican speaker at that convention going up and saying, progressives love America too. Muslims love America too. You know what I mean? And that was happening, right, like we welcome it. There was just none of that. Not only was there none of it, you almost couldn’t even imagine it because it’s anathema to what they were arguing. Claire McCaskill: Right. Their whole thesis is America is dead and dying and everyone who doesn’t agree with us is horrible. And by the way, we know there are more of you out there. So if you believe in our view that America is in the trash can, come and hang out in the trash can with us and we’ll put everybody else in jail. Tim Miller: Yeah. I mean -- Claire McCaskill: Right? Tim Miller: -- in order to save Trump. Claire McCaskill: All about one guy. Tim Miller: Yeah, the Harris speech was basically, in this room, we love America as it is, the diversity, all of the different elements, the gumbo of America. You’ve got Cedric Richmond coming on and we want to do some work to make it a little bit better for everybody. They over there hate America as it is and are happy to tear it apart to just make Donald Trump’s life a little bit better. And the Trump convention played right into that. It was all about him. He sat up in the box. It’s like you almost could imagine him like in a royal box holding out his fingers for people to kiss, you know, as they come by. Claire McCaskill: He was like on a throne. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: He was seated in a white leather throne. Tim Miller: It was bizarre. Claire McCaskill: It was weird. Okay. So here’s the other thing I noticed. Besides the fact that we were very disciplined about reaching out, we also stole your shit. I mean, your former party shit, right? We stole it. We stole the flag. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We stole freedom and we even stole football. Tim Miller: Yes. Claire McCaskill: I mean, we now have the triumvirate. We have the three Fs. And I remember back in the day when I used to like meekly say, hey, could we spend more time talking about, you know, how we love America and we all go to church and all of those things. And we were so busy drilling down to the 14th paragraph of the policy that we were going to enact as it related to whatever policy thing we were doing that year that we never really got to that emotional place. And so everybody in the Republican Party who is saying, well, where are their policies? I’m saying I am so happy that we did not dwell on the details of our policy and actually drove a theme. Tim Miller: Same. And you mentioned, there’s a fourth F there, faith. Also, there’s a lot of references to -- Claire McCaskill: Faith, right. Tim Miller: -- kind of religious faith during this and comfort with it and the USA chance. Look, I was feeling this could have been a 1988 Reagan-Bush convention at times, not on the policy, but just on the thematic side of it, right, about American exceptionalism and excellence with a very modern twist, right? Like part of why it’s exceptional is Kamala Harris’s story, right? This could happen here, right? That we could have an immigrant mother -- Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: -- a single mother, mixed race, you know, woman taking this nomination. So his grandmother speaks with an accent, whatever the line was. So, that melding of kind of those chest-thumping patriotic themes that you hear from Republicans with, okay, but why are we chest-thumping? You know, this appreciation of diversity in the country. I thought it was really good. One other thing that was stolen, some of the foreign policy stuff, now some of the liberal listeners might get a little triggered by this, so just trigger warning. Some of the foreign policy stuff could have been from the McCain convention. (BEGIN AUDIO) Kamala Harris: I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-un who are rooting for Trump -- (CROWD CHEERING) Kamala Harris: -- who are rooting for Trump. Because you know, they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won’t hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: I mean, it’s just like standing up to autocrats, standing up to dictators, the dictators are rooting for Trump. I loved that line. They’re rooting for him. They want him to win because he wants to be a dictator. You know, standing up to Iran, standing with our allies, Ukraine against Putin. I’ve been saying this for a while because I went to about maybe about six months ago, I went to a briefing with the vice president and she was so passionate about this, America’s role in the world and our allies. And I’ve been saying to the never Trumpers, I was like, I don’t think you realize how strong she is on these themes. It doesn’t mean she’s going to be a warmonger or to save her rattling, we’re not invading Iraq, right? But I just like this notion of America has a positive role to play in the world and she wants America to be strong on the world stage. I thought she hit that out of the park for Nikki Haley voters, you know. That was really key I think. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that we are the leaders of the free world and it matters. And, you know, I know the overriding sense that she had about this speech. I know this. I know her, was to show strength. And when I heard her use the word lethal, I grinned from ear to ear. (BEGIN AUDIO) Kamala Harris: As commander-in-chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. (CROWD CHEERING) (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: Because the word lethal in the context of our military is exactly the kind of terminology she should be using. And anybody who watched that speech and thinks that somehow she’s some kind of shrinking violet in front of world leaders, I mean, that just disappeared, instantly disappeared. So quickly before we go to a break. I’d like you to pick on Monday, who was the best speaker on Monday? Who was the best speaker on Tuesday in terms of moving the ball? Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Use the coach’s metaphor. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We’re trying to move the ball down the field. Who were the best speakers each night to move the ball down the field? Tim Miller: Okay. The first night I think was probably Jasmine Crockett. I thought AOC was also pretty good on Monday, even though that wasn’t my politics. I thought she gave an objectively good speech. (BEGIN AUDIO) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: In Kamala Harris, we have a chance to elect a president who is for the middle class because she is from the middle class. (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: Tuesday, I mean, it was the Obamas. It was just the two of them together. Michelle’s was probably better if I had to pick, but just they worked together. I mean, they were just going to work on that guy with like a blowtorch and pliers between the two of them. (BEGIN AUDIO) Michelle Obama: For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. (CROWD CHEERING) Michelle Obama: I wanna know, who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs? (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: It was amazing I thought. Harris obviously last night was the best of Kinzinger. I should shout out Kinzinger. (BEGIN AUDIO) Adam Kinzinger: I’ve learned something about the Democratic Party and I want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret. The Democrats are as patriotic as us. (CROWD CHEERING) (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: And the third night. Claire McCaskill: That would be Oprah. (BEGIN AUDIO) Oprah Winfrey: Common sense tells you that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect. (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: Oprah. Claire McCaskill: Oprah. Tim Miller: Thank you, yeah, Oprah. Claire McCaskill: Definitely Oprah. Tim Miller: Oprah was really good on the third night, though. I should shout out Wes Moore too. I thought Wes Moore was also really good on third -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Wes Moore’s really good. And I gotta tell you that I thought Doug Emhoff did a really good job too. Tim Miller: Sam. (BEGIN AUDIO) Doug Emhoff: And now that the country needs her, she’s showing you what we already know. She’s ready to lead. (CROWD CHEERING) DOUG EMHOFFF: And with your help, she will lead with joy and toughness with that laugh and that look, with compassion and conviction. (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: Because women of America fell in love with that guy at that moment. They saw how much he loved her. They saw a guy whose masculinity wasn’t threatened by not only taking a step back from his career, but just taking a step back and being there to hold her hand and tell everybody how great she is. And also the faith thing. It was obvious that this is a faithful Jewish man who is steeped in his faith. And I thought the way he wove that into the speech without it feeling like he was doing anything, but just telling you about how he grew up and why he loved her. It really was very good. And Walz was pretty good too. You know why I loved Walz? I loved Walz because he was 15 minutes long. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Who does that? Tim Miller: He was eight minutes shorter than Bill Clinton. (BEGIN AUDIO) Tim Walz: It’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal, but we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field and boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced and Kamala Harris is ready. (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: Okay. Tim Miller: It was good. Claire McCaskill: All right. So let’s take a little break here. We’ll pause and up next. Tim and I are going to look at what lies ahead for the vice president’s campaign post-convention and into the lion’s den of the next two months. We’ll be back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. My co-host, former Republican operative and “Bulwark” writer-at-large, Tim Miller is still with me. By the way, before we start what we got to do now, the campaign has to do now, my favorite line from a Republican was, if you vote for Kamala Harris, you’re not a Democrat, you’re a patriot. Tim Miller: Yes. Geoff Duncan. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Geoff Duncan. That was really a strong line. So what now? Tim Miller: Geoff Duncan was so good. I mean, I love Kinzinger, his speech was good. But Geoff Duncan, both of that, and the other thing, just one sentence on it, the line that his son told him, you know, it’s never the wrong time to do the right thing. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Miller: I’m taking that little line and I’m sending it to every Republican in my life that was like, where have you been? All right, there’s 70 days left. It’s never the wrong time to do the right thing. Like you can come out now. You can speak. There was a couple of Republicans, I think, that should have been speaking this week that weren’t. Claire McCaskill: I agree. Tim Miller: Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, Mark Esper, et cetera. So I’m hoping that some of them get off the sidelines. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Mark Esper should have been there instead of Leon Panetta. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, I love Leon and he did a perfectly great job and the message came through loud and clear, but it would have been better coming from Mark Esper. Tim Miller: Yes, absolutely. Claire McCaskill: Or even McMaster. Tim Miller: Yeah, any of them, any of them. Where were they? Where are they? John Kelly, what are you doing? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, where is John Kelly and Mattis? Where are they? I agree. All right, so what’s going to happen now? What do you think this addled brain that sounded like the neighbor down the street that’s weird that you can’t get off the phone when he called into Fox last night. What does Civita’s and Susie, what’s her name have? Tim Miller: Susie Wiles. Claire McCaskill: And Corey Lewandowski, what do they have in store? Tim Miller: I don’t know if you’re intentionally mispronouncing all three of their names, but I’m going to pretend that you are just as a troll. Claire McCaskill: I am. I am. Tim Miller: Unfortunately, well, not Lewandowski because he was never actually a strategist, but the other two I’ve worked with. Look, I mean, Trump obviously is freelancing a lot of this himself. I mean, last night he calls into Fox. He’s like hitting the keys by accident, like an old man on the phone. You can hear it beeping. So, you know, it’s not exactly a tight ship over there. And the speech in, I guess it was in North Carolina, he’s like pulling the crowd saying, my advisors want me to focus on policy, but I want to be mean, what do you think? And the crowd’s like, mean, you know. So, I don’t know. Does it matter what (inaudible) loves to be the one? Claire McCaskill: You can’t make it up. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You can’t make this shit up. You just can’t make it up. Tim Miller: No, it’s totally out of ideocracy and like, it’s just straight out of Hector or Mountain Dew Camacho. And so I think that Trump’s going to keep being Trump. So the question is, what’s Harris going to do? I mean, there are a couple of debates, right? And it’s keeping this same broad message, positive momentum going forward because, you know, it’s not like the Trumps have a secret plan up their sleeve. I mean, what’s going to happen is they’re going to run ads that try to turn her into socialist leftists from California and then Trump’s going to say mean things about her. That’s their campaign. Claire McCaskill: I would love it if the Harris campaign started pulling some tape of all the times Trump has said, I’m going to have a really good policy on that in two weeks. He does it over and over again. I mean, he told us he was going to get his healthcare plan that was going to be bigger and better and perfect in two weeks, back in 2016, and we still have not seen this elusive health care plan. He was just asked this week about medical abortions. Tim Miller: Yes. Claire McCaskill: And he said, well, there’s going to be some specifics on that, but generally, and he really tried to straddle it so hard, it made me hurt how hard he was trying to straddle to keep the extreme anti-choice folks happy, but knowing that politically, he couldn’t go there. And so he won’t even answer that question cleanly or plainly and yet they’re yammering about how we don’t have policy. I mean, I just think she should say, we’ll give you details on policy as soon as you show us your health care plan. Right? Tim Miller: Yeah, I just think that shows the weakness of all this. It’s like, yeah, like, what are you talking about? What’s Trump’s policy? Like, you had no platform four years ago. Trump’s policy is whatever, you know, comes out of his pie hole at any given moment. So, I don’t think that that is a real vulnerability. I think the more that the Republicans are hyperventilating and being like, Kamala hasn’t done interviews, Kamala has no policy, whatever. Just ignore that, stay focused. I thought she did just enough policy last night and she gave a clear economic policy message that was kind of in the Clinton mold, you know, very sort of middle class focused. The immigration, she did some immigration last night, she did some foreign policy. That’s all she needs to do. She doesn’t need to be putting out five page white papers. Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: Nobody cares about that. Claire McCaskill: Nobody cares about it. And frankly, this was usually our downfall. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Usually our downfall, that we get so caught up in the weeds that we forget the message. I got to just mention it just because I’m so happy today that I believe RFK is endorsing Trump. I mean, you know, it is like officially now Looney Tunes all the way around. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Do you think on any stretch this actually hurts Kamala Harris? The bear carcass man with the worm in his brain is going to go with his conspiracy theorist buddy, Trump. I mean -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- should she worry a bit about that? Tim Miller: I don’t think she should worry about it. I have a kind of two minds about this because RFK was a huge threat when Biden was in the race, right, because he was picking up a lot of the double haters. Those people have all coalesced around Kamala now. So in a lot of ways, having a smaller third party number is good because of the structural disadvantages Democrats have in the electoral college. If Trump has a ceiling of 47, 48, maybe at most, you know, you want to be able to get as high as possible, 51, 51 and a half. So just mathematically, I don’t think it hurts that much and I certainly, thematically, it doesn’t hurt having the anti-vax crazies all in one boat. I had a slight kind of wish that maybe RFK was going to cleave off. It was going to do like a reverse Jill Stein to Hillary to Trump, like kind of an accidentally hurt him by cleaving off like 1%. So, that’s the only downside, I think, to him endorsing. Claire McCaskill: So the operation on the other side -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- the counter-programming piece. I noticed their counter-programming yesterday, the advance team was so good, they walked into a bakery with Vance. The people there didn’t know who he was. He didn’t know what to say. The woman says, I’m J.D. Vance. I went for vice president. She goes, okay. Like -- Tim Miller: Okay. Claire McCaskill: -- it was -- Tim Miller: Cool bro. Claire McCaskill: They didn’t even -- Tim Miller: Can you turn the camera down? (BEGIN AUDIO) J.D. Vance: I’m J.D. Vance. I’m running for vice president. Good to see you. Unknown: Okay. J.D. Vance: We’re going to do two dozen. Unknown: Okay. J.D. Vance: Yeah. Just a random sort of stuff here. Just everything. Yeah, a lot of glazed here, some sprinkle stuff, some of these cinnamon rolls, just whatever makes sense. (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: They didn’t even have fillers. I mean, the basics of an advanced stop by in presidential is you have supporters as fillers. So there are people around that are looking adoringly at your candidate. And this guy looked like somebody get me out of here. Clearly, these people don’t like me and I don’t know what to say. I mean, what is going on over there? Tim Miller: Yeah, he’s bad at small talk too. And just contrast it with how awesome the advance was of the Harris-Walz event in Milwaukee where they cut from the convention up to Milwaukee -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Miller: -- and it just looked amazing in their full stadium. So what are they doing? Well, I think that Trump is lazy and tired and old. And so he’s only doing like two or three events a week and he barely even leaves his house. I mean, he has two press conferences, one at Mar-a-Lago, one at Bedminster in the last two weeks. So what they have is Vance doing a lot of heavy lifting as far as multiple events a day, going out there, going to the swing states, trying to get local news coverage. The problem with that is that he’s not that good at this. Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: Pretty awkward. People don’t like him. He’s off-pudding. He’s grumpy. And so I think that the theory of the case is, okay, well, we’re going to work J.D. who’s young and we can tell him what to do and get onto the local news in all these various markets and fly him around. But the downside of that is you’re going to have these awkward encounters because he’s J.D. Claire McCaskill: And now they’re viral. You know, back in the day, you had one bad stop by, you know, he would get buried pretty quickly. But what’s going on now -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- organically in social media, and this isn’t the campaign. These are folks out there that are talented, the content creators that were treated like heroes at our convention. It was really interesting. They had their own rooms. They had their own lounges. They had their own podium. I mean, it was all about these content creators and I had a bunch of them come up and talk to me and I recognized, you know, once they told me what the handles were, I recognize these people -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- but I’d never met them, of course. And they were all there and they’re all creating this stuff and the campaign doesn’t have to do anything. Tim Miller: Yeah, no. And J.D. makes it easy on them. Claire McCaskill: He does. Okay. So let me ask you this. Do you think they’re smart to continue to bang on Project 2025 or are we spending too much time on it and should we let it go or should they continue to try to make this the boogie man that America should be afraid of? Tim Miller: I think it’s good. The way they’ve done it is they’ve kind of put some pretty traditional democratic attacks underneath the Project 2025 label and I like that as a strategy, you know. And so I think that that works and I think that just focusing on the extremism, you know, the extremism of the people that would go work for Trump is compelling. Claire McCaskill: The last thing I wanted to talk to you about today before I let you go, because I know you’ve got lots to do and I’d like to get home and go to bed. I’m still in the hotel room in Chicago. So here’s the thing. I don’t really know if Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can continue to be the cheerful warriors with all the incoming. What would be the big pep talk you would give them if you were in the room with them? Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: What would you tell them that they needed to make sure they did what to win every single day for 74 days? Tim Miller: Yeah. Well, look, I think they can continue to be happy warriors. I love how they’ve had the kind of brush off the shoulder response to the racist and gross attacks on the family. You know, you could get defensive, get bogged down in that, and the Republicans are gonna be gross. They’re gonna go after Tim Walz’s kid. They’re gonna say Kamala Harris just turned black. And like, they should be called out from that by all of us. But the campaign really, I like they kind of laughing at it, diminishing it. You can talk about how pathetic and sad it is. So I think that’s a way to kind of continue to have the happy warrior image. I think we have two jobs basically over the next 70 days. One is continue to activate the base voters. These people that haven’t paid as close of attention, younger voters, you know, voters of color in particular that like don’t watch MSNBC, right? Like the people that just are not as engaged in the news. How are you getting them excited for Kamala Harris? That is going to mean getting Taylor Swift out there, you know, doing the stuff, getting the TikTok’s, working with these influencers, right? Like she’s gotta keep that momentum going for 70 days as having this be a cultural movement. Simultaneously, rhetorically, I always use as my North Star. In Georgia in 2022, Brian Kemp, the conservative governor, won in a pretty landslide. Raphael Warnock won in a landslide, right? There was like 15% of Georgia that voted for Brian Kemp and Raphael Warnock. These are people that have traditional values. A lot of people voted for you back in the day, Claire, that type of person. Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: And I think this convention, a lot of the messaging was reaching out to that person. All that stuff we’re talking about, faith, freedom, patriotism, they got to keep doing that and, you know, rhetorically. And so sometimes those two things are intention, right? Like how do you excite the base while also reaching out to the Brian Kemp voter? I think that’s like their big challenge and they’ve managed it pretty good so far. And I think that’s what they got to be focused on. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. It’s called persuasion versus getting your folks to vote. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And that is the tension of the last 60 days. Well, I hope that we have a chance to talk either again on this podcast or maybe on the air about the wonderful fundraiser that Trump is having for the J6 criminals at Bedminster. Tim Miller: I don’t get it. And speaking of one more thing you’ve stolen from the Republicans, we’ve. I can call us we now. The police, she was out there going, he sent rioters to attack police, right? So yeah, we can talk about that more. Claire McCaskill: All right. Well, you’re the best. Thank you for joining me today. I know you were busy this morning. Former Republican operative now on the side of the force and the force is with him. He’s the host of the “Bulwark” podcast. If you haven’t listened to, it’s really good. And author of “Why We Did It: A Travelogue from the Republican Road to Hell.” Thanks a bunch, Tim. Tim Miller: Thanks, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Up next, we’re going to have Cedric Richmond, the former Louisiana congressman and a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair join me to spend a little bit of time unpacking from the campaign’s perspective what they accomplished and what they are seeing down the road. We’ll be back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. Now that Tim Miller and I have laid out how the convention was perceived, both in person and on screen, I wanted to get a perspective from inside the campaign. How are they feeling? What are they excited about? What are they worried about? And joining me now for an inside look is the perfect person to discuss this with, Cedric Richmond. He’s the former Louisiana congressman and former advisor to President Biden, and he is now a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair. Welcome Cedric. I’m really honored you’re here. Cedric Richmond: Thank you, Senator, for having me. Claire McCaskill: You bet. So I just got to start and I know I’ve already tweeted something at Stephanie this morning. People don’t really know about the talent behind the scenes that make the production value of conventions. Excellent. But man, that was really well done, Cedric. The campaign should be really proud of that convention. I think a new gold standard has been set. Cedric Richmond: Well, I’ll tell you, I think that it starts at the top. Minyon Moore was an excellent chair. Stephanie Cutter coming in to do the production and then Alex’s CEO, our executive director. I think not only was it a great production, but you have to realize three weeks ago everything changed on what the convention is and what they had to produce. And so they probably did this in two and a half weeks and I think that they pulled it off. It was a miracle but it just goes to show the talent that they have. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and I think the other thing the convention did, which is so good for our party, is that we showcase the talent that we have on the bench from local officials to law enforcement officials to just regular folks that contributed and then all of the members of Congress and the senators and the governors and the other statewide officials. And Cedric, how did you get them all to be so disciplined about message? I have never seen that kind of discipline from folks who run for office before in my life. Cedric Richmond: Well, some of them were more disciplined than others. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Cedric Richmond: But in the general sense and theme, I think that most people realized how serious this is. So they stayed on the messages that they wanted to deliver. But the other extraordinary part, and Senator, I think you were dead right in your assessment, was how broad the speakers were from very young people to law enforcement to veterans to teachers to ordinary Americans that just want something different. And I think that the entire convention was wrapped in love of country and I think that that’s going to resonate and I think that people are going to recognize what’s at stake. Claire McCaskill: Are you at all worried? It is so smart the way that every night of the convention, the message came through loud and clear, come join us. If you love your country, come join us. We don’t care what party you have been or you are. We don’t care how you feel about any certain issue we just want you, because of the values of our country, to join us at this important moment in this really delicious, diverse coalition of folks that want to stop a really dangerous guy from stepping back in the Oval. Are you worried that the base is, I mean, you guys got to do two things, right, over the next two months? You’ve got to keep the base at a fever pitch to drive out a high level of voting amongst our traditional coalition, but you also have to keep persuading people in these swing states. They’re called that for a reason because they have voters that go back and forth from Democrat to Republican, from Democrat to Republican. How are you going to manage that tension over the next 60 days? Cedric Richmond: Well, on the turnout and the GOTV and enthusiasm, I think that we continue to try to build it. We’re not under the illusion that you’re gonna keep this excitement up from a convention all the way to Election Day. So we expect it to go down and then we build back up with Election Day as the goal. And to the extent that we have early voting and voting by mail wrapped up in between, we will continue to reach out and inspire those voters to get involved. And so the way I look at it is you have to inspire people and you have to remind them, why bother go out and vote? Why bother wait in line? Why bother do all of those things? And really you do that by answering the question, what’s in it for me? And we’ll continue to do that. And then we’ll continue to make our case to undecided voters that there’s a place for you in this party, but at the end of the day, this administration will wake up every day, trying to figure out how to make your life better. Claire McCaskill: It was artfully and deftly done that so many speakers took apart Donald Trump without ever saying his name. It was remarkable. The Obamas did it. Oprah Winfrey did it. Tim Walz did it and the vice president did it. And one of the ways that is happening is through the use of Project 2025. How big a piece is 2025, that project, going to have in the paid advertising? Do you see that as a continuing vessel for the anti-Trump stuff without going after him personally? Cedric Richmond: When we need to draw contrast with our policy versus his, that’s what we will go to. And elections are about contrast. And it’s a binary choice between two people and we’re gonna make that case and we’re gonna continue to show the dangers of Project 2025 and how for most American families, it is very detrimental. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and he is really trying to weasel away from it, but I think you guys even have video of him, don’t you, at that dinner? I know you’ve got the transcript of what he said at the dinner in April of 2022 when he said just straight out, they are putting together the framework of what we’re going to do in the next administration. I just hope you guys don’t let him weasel out, which I know you won’t. There are so many good people on the campaign. I mean, you are part of an amazing team. I don’t think there’s ever been a team put together quite like this since I’ve been around politics and I’m old, Cedric. I’m really old. Okay. So were you worried about not giving uncommitted delegates a chance to speak? Was there a lot of discussion about that? I know it had to be a difficult decision, and I know that everyone is taking very seriously the concerns that so many in our party have about what is going on in Gaza in terms of the innocent lives that are being lost. Is there anything you can tell us about that decision and how it was made? Cedric Richmond: Well, we want to hear from everybody in the party, but you know, and I know that this convention came together very quick with a bunch of moving parts. And to the extent that Vice President Harris has strong opinions on what’s happening in the Middle East, we wanted it to be her voice. We wanted her to address the issue. And we take all our delegates seriously. And the one thing I will say is we took uncommitted seriously. But it just didn’t happen that they were on the platform and that they had to speak. But I think what was most important is that the American people got to hear from the person that will be in the Oval Office, the person that will set the policy on what she believes, what she wants and where her values are. Claire McCaskill: I’ve had people that have said to me, you know, I would volunteer, but you know, I just don’t know that I want to do what they’re going to ask me to do. And I don’t know that I want to knock on a stranger’s door. Can you just briefly let folks know about the variety of things that you could do as volunteers that it doesn’t require that you go door to door and knock on strangers doors? I’m afraid we’re losing some foot soldiers because they think the only thing that people are going to ask him to do is something that they’re just uncomfortable with. Cedric Richmond: Well, look, it is a very divided country and it’s very volatile time. I understand that. I understand their concerns, but there are multiple ways to do it, some are through official ways of going and volunteering in a campaign. Look, there’ll be states like Louisiana, which is my state, which will be a donor state. We’re going to register people to vote with all of our activity and most of our energy will be geared towards those states that will decide this presidency. And that’s the blue wall of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And then we’ll go out to the sunbelt, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, all of those states. So what you could do is anytime you’re just home and you’re really feeling antsy about this election, you could go to the headquarters, pick up postcards and drop postcards to everybody, you know, that lives in those states because one, they will see how serious it is to you that you took the time to drop them a postcard. But the truth is you could call them, you can text them, you can e-mail them. But we just have to remind people what’s at stake and we have to make sure that we take this excitement and we turn it into action. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I have a grandson that’s starting at the University of Wisconsin next week and I told him, listen, you need to transfer your registration to Wisconsin, which you certainly legally can do. There’s no issue with that whatsoever. And people need to think about that. Are there college students in your world that are going to school in one of those states? I mean, we do voter stuff on campuses, obviously, but there are many kids that just keep their registration at home. And if they’re from a bright blue place and they’re going to school in one of the battleground states, they need to move that registration. And isn’t it fun that we got North Carolina on the map, Cedric? Cedric Richmond: North Carolina’s on the map. Claire McCaskill: It’s on the map. Cedric Richmond: And I had to go back the other day to realize that President Obama won it, so. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, absolutely. Cedric Richmond: We know what to do. We know how to do it. And I think with that gubernatorial race going on over there, that’s as much contrast as you can ever have, so -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Cedric Richmond: -- I’m excited about North Carolina. And look, in four years, I think we’re going to have more states in play. And so it’s continued to grow the map for us into purple states and continue to articulate our values. And I think that between our coach and our VP, we have a wonderful team. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, we do. I’m glad you’re on it and I’m really, really honored and glad you took a few minutes to spend some time with us this morning. Tell everybody on the team that they really did a great job this week, especially all the folks on the team, Cedric, that don’t get the public love. You know who they are. You know the ones that are running digital. You know the ones that they know their way around because they started working in campaigns when they were teenagers. Tell all those kids for me how proud we are of them and their commitment to this cause. Cedric Richmond: Well, certainly, we’re doing that. We’ll also tell you that keep doing what you’re doing. It’s critically important. We’re so proud of what you’re doing and it makes me very happy that as a freshman legislator, I went out to campaign for you and your re-election bid. So, you know, things happen for a reason, but you are where you are and I think you’re going to help us save this country. Claire McCaskill: Well, listen, there’s a lot of karma in this thing and I think maybe, I mean, I know it’s negative and I’m not supposed to say this in this campaign, but I’m not on the campaign so I can say it. I just want you to know the ultimate karma is Donald Trump getting dusted by Kamala Harris. Cedric Richmond: Absolutely. Claire McCaskill: That is great karma and you helping me back in the campaign and you helping me out this morning shows you got a lot of good karma coming your way too. Cedric, thanks so much for your time. We really appreciate having you. Cedric Richmond is a former congressman from Louisiana, former advisor to President Biden, and now a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair. Cedric Richmond: Thank you.

Colorado’s Dave Williams becomes latest GOP chair to be ousted,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 9:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/colorados-dave-williams-becomes-latest-gop-chair-ousted-rcna168239,"Former state Rep. Dave Williams’ tenure as chairman of the Colorado Republican Party was already a mess before the summer began, but things went from bad to worse a couple of months ago. Indeed, it was in early June when the state GOP chair issued a call to burn all Pride flags, at which point several local party officials decided it was time to show Williams the door. Two months later, they appear to have done exactly that. Colorado Public Radio reported: The vote was not close, though it is apparently being contested. In fact, after the vote to remove Williams as the state Republican Party chair, the Coloradan dismissed the meeting as “illegal“ and “illegitimate,” claimed that he was still the state GOP chair, and said the matter would actually be resolved by a separate vote at a different meeting. His reaction suggests a legal dispute is inevitable, which probably isn’t what party officials want to see as the election season takes shape. I won’t pretend to know how, when or whether this will be resolved, but the circumstances sure are familiar. Earlier this year, for example, the Republican Party of Michigan removed Kristina Karamo as state party chair after months of infighting and weak fundraising. Karamo claimed the votes didn’t count, and as of the weekend, she’s still asking the courts to reinstate her. Soon after, the Republican Party of Florida removed Christian Ziegler as its state party chair after he faced allegations of rape and video voyeurism. Two weeks later, Republican Party of Arizona Chair Jeff DeWit resigned following the release of a dubious audio recording of a conversation he apparently had with failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. A month after that, Ronna McDaniel resigned as chair of the Republican National Committee after losing Donald Trump’s support. Taken together, just this year, three state Republican Parties have ousted their chairs, one state Republican Party’s chair quit, and the Republican National Committee’s chair also quit. All of which is to say, things could be better in GOP politics. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Monday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.26.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mondays-campaign-82624-rcna168226,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released new fundraising data over the weekend, and the totals are impressive: The Democratic nominee and her partners have raised $540 million for the general election, including $82 million during the Democratic National Convention and $40 million on the heels of Harris’ convention speech. * Though Donald Trump probably doesn’t want to hear this, the television ratings for the Democratic convention outpaced the totals for the Republican convention, and Harris’ speech drew a larger audience than the former president’s convention remarks. * NBC News reported late last week, “Nebraska voters will weigh two different abortion-related constitutional amendments this fall, with the secretary of state’s office certifying both measures Friday to appear on the ballot.” * In Alaska’s U.S. House race, Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom had Trump’s backing, but she nevertheless finished third in a multicandidate field. On Friday, she ended her candidacy, setting up a contest that will pit incumbent Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola against Republican Nick Begich III. * Still searching for an effective line of attack against Harris, Trump has repeatedly complained in recent days that the vice president thanked her supporters too much last week. * In Pennsylvania, a state judge concluded late last week that Cornel West’s third-party presidential campaign is ineligible for the state’s 2024 ballot. * The Harris campaign tapped Yohannes Abraham, the U.S. Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to help lead its presidential transition team. * And while Election Day 2024 is still 10 weeks away, the Associated Press reported, “In just two weeks, Sept. 6, the first mail ballots get sent to voters. ... And early in-person voting will start as soon as Sept. 20 in some states.”"
"Lawyers from Reagan, Bush administrations endorse Harris in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 8:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/lawyers-reagan-bush-administrations-endorse-harris-2024-race-rcna168217,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his presidential campaign on Friday and threw his support behind Donald Trump’s Republican candidacy. Time will tell whether this affects the 2024 race in any meaningful way, though at face value, the significance of the developments seemed limited: The independent conspiracy theorist has never held public office. His notoriety comes from being a lawyer with a famous name. Around the same time as Kennedy’s news, however, some lawyers who lack famous names made a notable endorsement of their own. Fox News reported: “We endorse Kamala Harris and support her election as President because we believe that returning former President Trump to office would threaten American democracy and undermine the rule of law in our country,” the lawyers wrote in a letter that the signatories shared first with Fox News Digital. The signatories added that “we urge all patriotic Republicans, former Republicans, conservative and center-right citizens, and independent voters to place love of country above party and ideology and join us in supporting Kamala Harris.” The same joint statement went on to remind the public, “Donald Trump’s own Vice President and multiple members of his Administration and White House Staff at the most senior levels — as well as former Republican nominees for President and Vice President — have already declined to endorse his reelection.” “Trump’s attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after losing the election proved beyond any reasonable doubt his willingness to place his personal interests above the law and values of our constitutional democracy,” the Reagan and Bush administration lawyers added. “We cannot go along with other former Republican officials who have condemned Trump with these devastating judgments but are still not willing to vote for Harris. We believe this election presents a binary choice, and Trump is utterly disqualified.” They concluded that the GOP nominee is “guilty of grave wrongdoing to our Constitution, democracy, and rule of law, and who remains unfit, dangerous, and detached from reality.” The endorsement from Friday came on the heels of Harris also picking up a variety of other Republican endorsements and Democrats including some GOP speakers at the party’s convention in Chicago. Indeed, Friday’s bookend endorsements were emblematic of the broader message the Harris campaign wants to convey to the electorate: Trump picked up support from a fringe anti-vaccine activist, while the Democratic nominee received support from lawyers from Republican administrations who want to put country over party. For Democrats pushing the “normal vs. weird” message, the developments were entirely on-message."
‘I’m not going to be afraid anymore’: How Biden’s plan for undocumented immigrants will change lives,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 8:07 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/m-not-going-afraid-anymore-bidens-plan-undocumented-immigrants-will-ch-rcna167593,"When Krysta Heard was just 3 years old, she made the dangerous journey on foot from Guerrero, Mexico to the U.S. Traveling through the California desert with her mom, aunt and cousins, Heard's family was looking for a better life, especially after her older sister, Cristabell, tragically passed away. “She died from a lack of access to clean water and sanitation,” said Heard, who is now 38 and lives with her husband and 4-year-old son in Denver. “This event altered the lives of my entire family ... It was pivotal in our immigration journey. After I was born, the goal [of my parents] was to give a new generation a safer life.” In 2016, at the age of 29, Heard became a beneficiary of DACA, the Obama-era action that protects young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. However, because the DACA program has been on consistent life support (several state courts have tried to overturn it, and the program was even temporarily rescinded by the Trump administration in 2017), Heard has continually feared that she could be separated from her family at a moment’s notice. But thanks to a new immigration measure set forth by President Biden, Heard has renewed hope that she will finally be able to adjust her status and receive a green card to become a permanent resident.  In June, Biden unveiled the executive action that would offer protection to undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens, as well as streamline work visas for DACA recipients and college graduates. The announcement marked the 12th anniversary of DACA. The move came after Biden implemented a crackdown on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Under Biden’s new “parole in place” program, non-citizens and DACA recipients like Heard, who are married to U.S citizens, will have the opportunity to apply for permanent residency without leaving the U.S. The new immigration measure is one of two policy directives from the Biden administration’s “Keeping Families Together” program. The parole in place process — which began accepting applications this week — could impact over 500,000 undocumented spouses, 90,000 of whom are DACA recipients, according to immigration advocacy group, FWD.US.  Until this point, there have been a number of deterrents that have kept non-citizens from filing applications to adjust their status. That includes the possibility of being barred from entering the country for up to 10 years, said Karen Tumlin, a civil rights lawyer and founder of the non-profit organization, Justice Action Center. “Sometimes they have to wait outside of the country for 10 years, or permanently when getting their green card… This [new] program can allow some of them to get what’s called parole, and then be able to get a green card [while staying in the U.S].” Heard said she started the process to become a permanent resident eight years ago. She was told to travel back to Mexico for a consular visit without a guarantee on the length of time she’d have to stay outside of the country – or if she’d be able to return at all. “That consulate appointment comes with a lot of surprises and risks. Many families like mine were all cleared to go, and never returned for one reason or another … This was not a risk I was willing to take,” said Heard. For example, one immigrant mother who applied for a green card through her U.S-born husband, found out she was banned from the U.S. for a decade when she went for her consular visit in Juarez, Mexico. “This executive order will allow me to have that interview here in the U.S., instead of in Mexico. After that, I can begin the pathway to citizenship,” Heard explained. Lizbette Vazquez, 34, who is currently undocumented, also said Biden’s new immigration program could be a gamechanger. In 2005, Vazquez moved from Guadalajara, Mexico to Pomona, California right after she turned 16. She said she immigrated to the U.S. with her parents to escape rampant crime in her hometown. Vasquez worked hard to get good grades, went on to college, and worked two jobs: tutoring in the mornings and working at a butcher shop to pay for her studies. She wanted to apply to the DACA program — which launched in 2012 — but was disqualified because she entered the U.S. just weeks after her 16th birthday. The DACA program requires beneficiaries to have arrived in the country by the age of 16.  Vazquez could benefit from the second measure of the President’s immigration program, which aims to streamline and expedite work visas for DACA recipients and undocumented citizens who missed out on the DACA program but are college graduates or students. Vazquez, who is a nurse and has been working as an independent contractor, said she will finally have options to adjust her legal status after almost two decades of living in the U.S. “It took me longer here in the U.S. to get my degrees, but I managed,” said the mom of three. “It was not free as my school loans are not forgiven and very expensive. Now I have two degrees and I just want to legally be able to work in a hospital and care for my patients.” Up until now, work-sponsored visas have been a tough sell for undocumented immigrants, as they require them to leave the country for an undetermined amount of time and receive a waiver to be readmitted to the United States, explained Dan Berger, an attorney at Cornell Law School’s Path2Papers Project, and advisory board member of the Presidents’ Alliance on Immigration & Higher Education. Biden’s immigration measure also gives Dreamers the ability to speak to their employers, or potential employers, about work sponsorship as a way to adjust their legal status. Under Biden’s new directive, consular offices abroad will shorten the amount of wait time for these waivers from months to just days or weeks, according to Tumlin. “It basically gets rid of some of the bureaucratic hoops that you have to jump to in order to get yourself to an employment-sponsored visa,” she said. Ultimately, Berger advised anyone who thinks they qualify for Biden’s new program to get a basic legal screening with a lawyer. Berger has helped a number of DACA recipients obtain work-sponsored employment. He explained there are a number of work visas available that some DACA recipients could qualify for beyond the more well-known H1-B employment-based visa. That includes visas such as the O-1 Visa for immigrants with extraordinary abilities (like doctors or Ph.D. graduates), the R-1 Visa for religious workers, or the E-2 Visa for business owners. As for how long Biden’s new immigration program will stay in place — especially amid the possibility of another Trump term — is still up in the air, said Tumlin.  But for now, immigrants like Vazquez and Heard said they will take advantage of the new immigration policy and are ecstatic they finally have a pathway to citizenship. “I’m not going to be afraid anymore,” said Vasquez ... And my family is going to be able to stay together.” Daniela Pierre-Bravo is a journalist, author, and founder of Acceso Community — a mentorship program for professional women.

The problem(s) with Paxton’s new election investigations in Texas,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-paxtons-new-election-investigations-texas-rcna168209,"Ken Paxton, Texas’ scandal-plagued attorney general, launched a couple of election-related investigations last week, both of which are controversial for different reasons. Last week, for example, Paxton’s office executed search warrants in the San Antonio area, alleging irregularities. Soon after, as a New York Times report explained, a Latino civil rights group asked the U.S. Justice Department to open an investigation into Paxton’s efforts, which targeted Latino voting activists and political operatives: The DOJ hasn’t yet said whether it’ll pursue the matter, and the Texas attorney general has claimed his recent raids had merit, but the simmering controversy is likely to continue. Paxton’s other election investigation in the Lone Star State is considerably weirder. The Texas Tribune reported: Evidently, Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo — whose conspiratorial perspective is difficult to defend — published an item to her social media account on Aug. 18, claiming that a friend of hers has a friend whose wife allegedly saw people registering immigrants to vote outside DMV offices. Despite the obviously flimsy nature of the claim, the host peddled the story on the air soon after, telling viewers that the immigrants in question were “illegals.” The Texas Department of Public Safety wasted little time in debunking Bartiromo’s claims, explaining that the claims were “simply false” and “kind of racist.” The chairman of the Parker County GOP agreed that the reports were “erroneous.” Nevertheless, three days after Bartiromo published her third-hand rumor online, Paxton’s office announced it was opening an investigation into “reports that organizations operating in Texas may be unlawfully registering noncitizens to vote.” Last week, a statewide poll from the University of Houston Hobby School and Texas Southern University’s Jordan-Leland School found Donald Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris in Texas, but only by about 5 points. The same poll found Republican Sen. Ted Cruz with a two-point lead over Democratic Rep. Colin Allred in the state’s U.S. Senate race. It was against this backdrop that Gabriel Rosales, Texas state director for the League of United Latin American Citizens, told the Texas Tribune that he viewed Paxton’s investigation as an act of intimidation to keep Hispanic voters from voting. Republicans “ see the writing on the wall,” he said. “They know that if the Hispanic vote comes out, they lose.”"
Shouldn’t Trump release his latest tax returns right about now?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shouldnt-trump-release-latest-tax-returns-right-now-rcna168192,"Donald Trump’s history of unfortunate money-making schemes took an unsettling turn in March when the former president started peddling the “God Bless the U.S.A. Bible,” offering customers an opportunity to get “the only Bible endorsed by President Trump” for just $59.99. It was a predictably successful venture: The cash-strapped Republican made $300,000 on the branded Bibles. We know this because of a personal financial disclosure form Team Trump released nearly two weeks ago. A CNN report on the documents added: All of which left us with a lingering question that regularly goes unasked: Shouldn’t Trump release his latest tax returns right about now? To be sure, I’m mindful of the larger circumstances. In May 2014 — more than a full decade ago — Trump promised to release his tax returns if he became a candidate. “If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely,” the Republican said the year before his ride down the golden escalator. “And I would love to do that.” In the years that followed, Trump ignored the modern bipartisan tradition, kept his tax returns hidden, broke a variety of promises related to transparency, and fought tooth and nail to keep the information from the public. Eventually, in the wake of leaks and court rulings, Americans learned details that were unflattering to the former president. But now that he’s running yet again, and Trump is the GOP’s nominee for the third consecutive cycle, shouldn’t the question return to the fore? Shouldn’t the Republican candidate at least face some questions about whether he’ll release his tax returns — even if we know the answer will be no? Often, questions we know the answers to go unasked, but that doesn’t mean the questions themselves lack merit. To simply not ask Trump about his recent tax returns — putting him to peddle yet another round of dubious claims about IRS audits that are probably imaginary — is to go easy on a major-party nominee for no reason. Indeed, the partisan asymmetry matters. On July 21, President Joe Biden announced that he would end his re-election campaign, and one week later, Vice President Kamala Harris released her tax returns from the previous 20 years. Trump could approach transparency the same way. On several occasions, he has said he would. So where are the documents? Why would he insist on secrecy for his tax returns from the last few years?"

Democrats found a perfect response to Trump's vision of patriotism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-democrats-patriotism-trump-rcna167961,"If you listen to many longtime observers, this year’s Democratic National Convention offered up something different from previous incarnations: an emphasis on striking a patriotic stance. From Vice President Kamala Harris praising “the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American” in her acceptance speech down to the attendees waving little flags in the audience, Democrats put their love of country front and center. But was this that much of a departure from the past? Osita Nwanevu, a contributing editor for The New Republic and columnist with The Guardian, wasn’t so sure Friday. “Which Democratic nominee didn’t ‘embrace patriotism?’” he asked in a now-deleted post on X. “Biden? Obama? Clinton?” Nwanevu is right that there wasn’t a time when Democrats explicitly rejected patriotism. What we saw last week, though, was a shift in tone and rhetoric, as Democrats filled the gap Republicans left wide open to define what “patriotism” means. Rather than mimic the GOP to insist that they are also patriots, for the first time in decades the DNC’s attendees instead declared with their whole chests that theirs is the party of real patriots. For longer than I’ve been alive, Republicans have been more than happy to accuse anyone to the left of former President Ronald Reagan of harboring anti-American sentiments. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, accelerated that trend as, in the aftermath, conservatives called forth a wave of jingoism and xenophobia that they insisted was the only way to love America. The PATRIOT Act authorized vast powers for the federal government to curtail Americans’ privacy and freedom of speech. President George W. Bush’s warning to other nations — “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists” — was turned inward toward any liberals who might speak out against invading Iraq. Many Democrats, terrified of accusations of not respecting the troops or being soft on terror, embarrassed themselves in their attempts to prove their own love of country. It’s impossible to defend how then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., began his acceptance speech at the 2004 DNC without cringing. (“John Kerry, reporting for duty,” he said with a crisp salute, despite having left the military more than 30 years earlier.) In the Obama era, the tea party movement’s thinly veiled racism was initially framed as a rejection of tyranny, drawing on symbols from the American Revolution, and “patriots” became a word associated with a certain brand of conservative. Ever focused on branding, former President Donald Trump claimed that visual vocabulary for his own, entwining his MAGA movement with the trappings of the banal, surface-level patriotism that Republicans had already embraced. But while he has embraced the American flag, sometimes literally, he has denigrated the highest ideals that that flag represents. Instead, Trump has called for the “termination” of the Constitution, and he has already attempted to overturning one presidential election. Trump has called the rioters who attempted to prevent his loss from becoming official on Jan. 6, 2021, “patriots” and just announced a fundraiser in their honor next month. Republicans, with very few exceptions, have backed his dystopian desire to substitute himself in place of devotion to the national interest. Despite that, as The Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted, voters are still more likely to view the GOP as the more patriotic party. Polling has somewhat borne that out in the past. A YouGov poll in 2018 found that Democrats were much less likely to call themselves “very” or even “somewhat” patriotic than their Republican counterparts. It’s worth noting that this was during the height of the Trump years, a time when Democrats had their faith in America deeply shaken. It’s a faith that has yet to recover, though, according to a survey Gallup conducted in June, which found only 34% of Democrats describe themselves as “extremely proud” to be an American. And yet the flag-waving and chants of “U-S-A” last week in Chicago would suggest otherwise. It instead speaks to an effort at redefining what love of country means along with reclaiming the concept of “freedom.” Democrats are celebrating the country’s diversity as a sign of national greatness — as opposed to the GOP’s picture of a nation of homogeneous, unwavering loyalty. This vision expands on President Joe Biden’s framing of the threat to democracy, broadening from a single man to the GOP’s fetish for that man. In setting out this new vision of patriotism, Democrats should remember that there must be room for loving criticism. In her opening essay for “The 1619 Project,” The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote about how Black Americans have always been among the most patriotic citizens. This is because despite the indignities we have suffered, we’ve been the ones most committed to seeing America embrace the better angels of its nature. The same can be said of the protesters gathered outside the arena each day and night to urge the Biden administration to halt the sale of arms to Israel as it continues its war in Gaza. The progressivism Democrats displayed last week can make an awkward fit with the conservative-coded aspects of patriotism, as The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Will Bunch rightly noted. But I would still argue that the two are more in sync than it would first appear. After all, it is an act of love of country to ask it to live up to its own ideals, to believe that it can still change for the better. The wish to see your home hold itself to the morals that it claims to represent is more patriotic than the desire to see one man ensconced as monarch in the White House."
"Democrats, stop calling the Harris-Trump race ‘the prosecutor’ vs. ‘the felon’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-prosecutor-felon-democrats-rcna167349,"Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, some Democrats have summarized her matchup against former President Donald Trump as “the prosecutor” versus “the felon.” On the day that President Joe Biden passed the baton to Harris, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said of her, “She is a prosecutor running against a felon.” At last week’s Democratic convention, speakers including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Biden embraced that framing. In defending his record on public safety, Biden said Monday, “And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.” The prosecutor versus the felon is the kind of glib expression that’s perfect for an election-year bumper sticker. However, the suggestion that a “felon” is inherently and permanently untrustworthy makes for a heaping helping of hypocrisy from a party that has rightly identified overcriminalization, mass incarceration and voter suppression as systemic problems. Yes, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts in May. Were it not for a Georgia prosecutor’s affair with a lawyer she hired, a Trump appointee in Florida entertaining his ridiculous motions and a Supreme Court that seems bent on rejecting the whole theory of America, he may have been convicted of up to 54 more. That said, Trump showed his manifest unfitness for office long before any of those indictments. He exhibited it during his first campaign, during his term in office, while campaigning as an incumbent and no more so than by rejecting his status as a lame duck. And he is further demonstrating that unfitness during this, his third campaign for president. But to label him a felon and use it to mean unfitness is to suggest that all “felons,” by their very nature, are bad and irredeemable. A political slogan can’t communicate every nuance. But at a minimum, it shouldn’t send a message inconsistent with the party’s stated values. There has been a conscious effort in recent years — no doubt derided by detractors as “woke” — to refrain from using language that dehumanizes people and reduces them to their status or their circumstances. Say “enslaved people,” not “slaves.” Say “incarcerated people,” not “prisoners” or “inmates.” Again, there are critics of such constructions, and, without a doubt, those constructions make for clunkier sentences. But the point remains that people who have experienced a thing are far more than the thing they’ve experienced. Consider the lawyer, poet and writer Reginald Dwayne Betts, as brilliant a person as you’ll find in this country. Before he wrote three acclaimed books of poetry and a memoir, and before his genius was recognized by the MacArthur Foundation, he spent years in prison for a violent carjacking he committed when he was 16. When discussing the title of his 2019 volume of poetry, Betts told NPR, “It’s called ‘Felon.’ But the thing is, ‘felon’ is just such an inadequate description of anybody.” Those using the “prosecutor vs. felon” dichotomy appear unaware of the inadequacy of that framing. They may believe themselves to be making a commentary only about Trump. But they are betraying a belief that the word “felon” tells you everything you’ll ever need to know about a person. And, to repeat, they’re undercutting their arguments against less punitive sentences and their arguments against letting people who’ve served their time vote again. If all felons are bad, then why should we fight for their right to participate in elections? Let’s set aside the fact that some people convicted of felonies aren’t guilty and, for argument’s sake, assume that everyone so labeled committed a significant crime. Even then, the list of felons would include good people who did uncharacteristically awful things, sometimes accidental things. That list would also include people who were horrible human beings and turned their lives around. And, yes, it would include people like Trump, that is, people we know would commit the same crimes again if given the chance. The argument against Trump, therefore, isn’t that he has a record. It’s that he’s unrepentant: a mendacious, self-seeking narcissist who has never evinced a shred of self-reflection or regret. It’s that he never has been, and likely never will be, deserving of anybody’s trust, let alone the country’s trust. As a veteran journalist, I have known a significant number of elected officials who have gone to prison. Not only that, but I’ve watched a few of them re-emerge, return to the game of politics and even run for office again. One of them once requested a meeting with me where he asked how I squared my belief in second chances with my opposition to his candidacy. Easily. My belief that people shouldn’t be forever punished doesn’t mean I think people who have been criminally punished and then run for office are automatically due political support. It doesn’t mean I think they’re good people. There are people I’d consider voting for even if they have gone to prison, and others I’d never consider even if they haven’t. Under no circumstances would the Democrats throwing around the word “felon” have considered voting for him even if a jury hadn’t found him guilty. That’s because they’re not opposed to Trump because he’s a “felon.” They’re opposed to Trump because he’s Trump."
States want to reduce qualifications for teachers. That’s a huge mistake.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 7:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/states-teachers-reduce-qualifications-school-year-rcna167554,"As the new school year begins across the country, public schools are struggling to hire and retain qualified teachers. Fewer young adults are entering the profession, shortages remain high — especially in hard-to-staff subjects and regions — and school staffs lack the diversity of their student populations. In attempting to fill vacancies, lawmakers in Florida, New Hampshire and elsewhere have proposed cutting corners by reducing the qualifications necessary to become a licensed teacher. But as an education policy analyst and a former teacher, I know this is a mistake. Deprofessionalizing education only compounds the harm that staffing shortages inflict on students and communities. Moving forward means addressing the root cause: lack of respect for teachers. Teaching public school during the first years of the Covid-19 pandemic, I experienced firsthand the treatment teachers face — and it was a roller coaster of a ride. One moment we were revered as hardworking heroes who care for children’s well-being and education. The next, we were called selfish and lazy by policymakers and the press alike. The infamous phrase “those who can’t do, teach” was weaponized against us. We were called insignificant at best, and manipulative at worst. Teachers have never asked to be called heroes; we just want to be respected as experts in our field. Public perception of teachers in America plays out in the ways they’re treated, starting with salary. As any educator will tell you, they aren’t in it for the money. But it is simply insulting that teachers make an average of 26.4% less than professions with similar levels of education in America. This disparity has been growing since the 1990s, with no sign of a rebound on the horizon. For people committed to educating our nation’s future generations, this pay gap can feel like a slap in the face, neglecting both the importance of their role and the amount of work teachers devote to their craft. Being an educator requires a level of expertise developed and maintained through high-quality preparation programs, continued professional development and experience. It demands a comprehensive understanding of child development, classroom behavior management and curriculum design and presentation. It means finding ways to connect lessons to differing learning styles, individual cultures and the community at large. And it entails building interpersonal relationships with students and helping empower them and their families to thrive outside the classroom. All of this is to say, teachers are vital members of the villages that raise our children. They play a pivotal role in developing America’s future doctors, engineers, artists, politicians, educators and engaged community members. Some of the recent policies proposed to address teacher workforce shortages suggest that any adult is capable of stepping into a classroom, managing student behavior and effectively implementing high-quality lessons. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. Countless studies demonstrate that among all school-related factors, teacher quality has the highest impact on student achievement. It affects not only students’ academic performance, but also everything from attendance and disciplinary records to socioemotional skills like collaboration and self-regulation. When children have an underqualified or uncertified teacher, when they’re jammed into already-packed classrooms, when their teacher receives little to no support from their district, their performance and development suffer as a result. And poor-quality education affects our nation as a whole — it weakens our economy, our national security and even our democracy. We can’t fix the teacher shortage by insulting everyone who is a part of the profession. We have to reframe what it means to be an educator and to be respected as such. Policies that don’t stem from this core tenet simply won’t produce results that benefit our students or the future of our country. Instead, policymakers should close the teacher pay gap; invest in public education to equip teachers with the resources and programming to ensure their students thrive; implement high-quality teacher apprenticeship models; and support student and teacher mental health. While some may look to seemingly quick solutions, long-term investments are the real solutions that strengthen our education system. To effectively address the challenges our teacher workforce faces, policymakers have to acknowledge that investing in the field of education is a worthy cause. Ensuring a bright and successful American future means properly educating the next generation. And to do that, we have to invest in those doing the educating — making sure they have sufficient financial and professional support; reducing barriers to entering and remaining in the field; and investing in school resources. As for the rest of us? We can help shift the narrative in our own communities and respect teachers as the experts they are."
How I’ve been convincing Christians they don’t have to vote Republican,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/christians-kamala-can-pull-evangelical-voters-away-donald-trump-rcna167561,"During the last month, Christians for Kamala joined the ranks of groups supporting Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. In so doing, they stand beside groups as wide-ranging as Comics for Kamala and Deadheads for Kamala. Because Harris has shown she will include us all in her vision for the United States and bring together what has been torn apart, all of these groups have seized upon the newfound enthusiasm among the electorate since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July and endorsed Harris. A religious coalition such as this entering the chat is an important step in the right direction, and, if built upon, could help sway enough movable religious voters in critical battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. What’s more, it could mean breaking the stronghold that MAGA forces have on many of our country’s evangelical voters. Thanks in part to the cooperation of so many self-identified Christian voters, the MAGA movement has seized control of the Republican Party and helped lead our country down a dark, democracy-threatening path. Former President Donald Trump and his team know this, and it’s at the core of their strategy in the lead-up to the November election. Compared with 2016, an erosion of his support from white men was Trump’s biggest problem in 2020, and his campaign is working overtime to fix that in 2024. In many places, this means courting white Christian men, especially from the evangelical and Catholic traditions. That’s one of the reasons he picked Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who converted to Catholicism five years ago, as his running mate. Central to our work at Vote Common Good, I spend a lot of my time traveling the country speaking to voters, particularly evangelical and Catholic voters who are hardwired into voting Republican, working to get them to break out of those patterns. What I’ve learned is that most don’t want or need their elected leader to be like them, but they really do want their leader to like them. It wasn’t clear that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton liked evangelical and Catholic men when she ran for president in 2016, and it remains largely unclear to many of these voters in 2024 if Kamala Harris does. Trump, on the other hand, probably doesn’t like them, but he put his arms around these voters in a transactional exchange, and he promised and in some cases delivered them power. But on the trail in 2020, 2022 and this year, I’ve gleaned the reason many evangelical and Christian voters ultimately leave Trump: his obvious lack of kindness. A poll that my organization Vote Common Good commissioned in 2020 showed that in swing states, Trump’s lack of kindness was driving evangelical and Catholic voters away in large enough numbers to potentially affect the outcome of the election. Voters typically realize that the way they vote reflects on them. And those religious voters who defected from Trump didn’t like the way his unkindness reflected on them, whether it be putting migrant children in cages, the way he treats women, the way he treats the press, the way he treats nearly everyone who left his administration and the way he treats democracy itself. Many of these voters know that’s not the behavior they want their children to emulate. The Harris campaign clearly knows it has an opportunity here. The choice of Tim Walz as vice presidential nominee is in no small part evidence of that. But it isn’t nearly enough. Democrats more broadly need to embrace the idea that evangelicals, and especially white male evangelicals, are worth winning and can be won without the party compromising its values. What it’s going to take is a concerted, grassroots effort to reach these voters, listen to them and bring them along on a journey to help them understand it’s OK for them to let concern for the common good, and not allegiance to a political party, determine how they vote. We need to tell them that what Democrats are pushing for lines up with the values evangelicals hold dear — making the world better and bringing people together. Those policies include commonsense gun reform to keep kids safe, engaging solutions at the border and lowering the cost of child care. Many Christians are heartbroken at the idea that they have to choose between a faith that’s meaningful to them and a political identity that has been wedded to it. They don’t know what to do, and we need to help them separate those two identities. It will take an effort like the one we made in Kent County, Mich., home to Grand Rapids and several Christian universities, before the 2020 election. We held voter rallies and roundtables; put up billboards juxtaposing the words of Jesus Christ with those of Trump; sent thousands of postcards to evangelical voters; and trained multiple local Democratic candidates on how to engage with faith voters. Our message to the 25% of the Kent County electorate that identified as evangelical was simple: Trump lacks kindness and it’s OK not to vote for the Republican. Trump beat Clinton by 3 points in Kent County in 2016. In 2020, he lost to Biden there by 6 points, a 9-point swing. I always believed a shift like that was possible, and I was at the convention in Chicago telling everyone who would listen the Kent County story and making the case that we cannot ignore evangelical voters. My efforts included being on a panel focused on how to move gettable voters. Biden did better than Hillary Clinton did with evangelical voters, and if we come together and don’t leave these folks to Trump, I think it’s possible for Harris to receive the highest level of evangelical support since Jimmy Carter got roughly half the evangelical vote in 1976. And if that were to happen, it would break the back of the MAGA movement. Now that the convention is over, we’ll be fueling up our bus, hitting the road and driving to Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and back to some of those same places again. We won’t leave movable voters out there on their own. We’ll let them know that they can make that switch, and they won’t be shunned or punished for it. We won’t give up on them, because they can help save our country from the antidemocratic policies the MAGA movement has been unleashing. Christians for Kamala, which I’m a part of, will make sure Christian faith voters are engaged in the political process."
I’m a judge. Here’s why the viral video of a teenager’s humiliation has me furious.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/detroit-judge-sued-handcuffed-teen-rcna167650,"I’ve been told that ego stands for “easing God out.” The video of a Detroit judge’s dehumanizing treatment of a teenage girl who dozed off in his courtroom while on a field trip to the courthouse is confirmation of this truth. Judge Kenneth King, the presiding criminal division judge in Michigan’s 36th District Court, yelled at a 15-year-old student who was visiting his courtroom with a nonprofit group and then sent her to the court’s jail cell, where she was made to disrobe and change into a jail jumpsuit and sit alone. As if that were not already excessively punitive, King continued the teenager’s humiliation by ordering her back into the courtroom as she wore handcuffs. He made her plead for leniency. He had her peers, some of whom were unable to muffle their laughter, vote on her fate. King, who has since been removed from his docket and ordered to undergo mandatory training, defended his actions when it became known what he’d done to the girl. “That’s not something that normally happens,” he told Detroit’s WXYZ-TV. “But I felt compelled to do it because I didn’t like the child’s attitude.” Calling his actions “my own version of ‘Scared Straight,’” he told the TV station, “I haven’t been disrespected like that in a very long time.” But the most glaring disrespect exhibited that day was from the judge himself. He not only disrespected the teenager he had before him, but he also disrespected the judiciary. In fact, watching what that judge did to that young person — which would have been out of order even if she were a defendant, not merely a student on a summer field trip — made me furious as a member of the legal profession, a retired jurist, a mother and a human being. Last week, the teenager’s family sued King, accusing him of violating her civil rights. “This is a very troubling case,” one of the family’s lawyers said. “We had a member of our bench denigrate, humiliate, intimidate and essentially incarcerate a 15-year-old kid.” That attorney is right. It is troubling. Visiting a courtroom should have been an opportunity to spark a desire in this young Black woman to, say, become a Supreme Court justice like Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Instead, because of King, she had a devastating encounter with a judge wrongly flaunting his authority that will only deepen her distrust, and the public’s distrust, in our justice system. True authority does not try hard. People who understand their authority know they don’t have to speak harshly to command respect. Authority is communicated through professionalism and fairness. Unfortunately, the judge in this case was more interested in asserting his dominance over this young person than in fostering an environment of learning, understanding and respect in his courtroom. There was no way the judge was going to look good by turning her into an inmate because she had fallen asleep. But he looked even worse after details of her circumstances were revealed. Latoreya Till, the teen’s mother, told NBC News that they have no permanent housing and that they had arrived late at the home where they were staying the night before the teenager’s field trip. In an interview with WXYZ-TV, she said, “The fact that he was talking about ‘You go home and get in your bed,’ how do you know my baby got a home? How do you know my baby got a bed, her own bed she could sleep in? She don’t have that right now, so she was tired.” People often fall asleep in court because of medication, a medical condition, the temperature in the courtroom, or not understanding the court proceedings. His ego made him assume she fell asleep to disrespect him. I know that being a judge is hard. I served for nearly 10 years in the municipal court in Newark, New Jersey. When I took my oath, I committed myself to treating every person who entered my courtroom with dignity, respect and fairness. This commitment is fundamental to the justice system’s purpose, to ensuring justice for all. This belief is grounded in a concept known as procedural justice or procedural fairness. Put simply, when people believe they are treated with dignity, respect and fairness by the justice system, the outcomes are overwhelmingly positive. Compliance with court orders increases. The public trusts the justice system more. And crime goes down. The principles of procedural justice require judges, attorneys and other justice system actors to ensure that people are given a voice, understand the process, and are treated with neutrality and respect. Crucially, and somewhat counterintuitively, this is as important as whether someone wins or loses in court. In other words, when a person feels like they have been treated decently, they are usually willing to accept the outcome of the case, even if it goes against them. What King did goes against every principle of procedural justice. Thankfully, few judges engage in such behavior. Still, this should serve as a stark reminder for those with authority of the dangers of ego. King had an obligation to remember that he wore a robe and not a crown. The judge’s behavior didn’t just harm one student; it harmed every person in the courtroom that day by negatively shaping their perception (or confirming their existing negative beliefs) about the justice system. Courtroom observers should leave with a greater respect for the judicial process. Clearly, those in King’s courtroom that day did not. A judge’s authority is not a weapon to be hurled at the weak. A judge’s authority must be used to protect, uplift and embody the principles of procedural justice. As the teenager’s mother put it, he was “supposed to show love and sympathy and implement the law, and he didn’t do none of that.”"
Trump judge greenlights machine guns under Second Amendment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/machine-guns-second-amendment-bruen-rcna168012,"A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump dismissed criminal charges for machine gun possession this week, citing the Second Amendment and Supreme Court precedent. The ruling highlights how the high court has expanded gun rights, as well as the broader impact Trump has had on the judiciary beyond the Supreme Court. U.S. District Judge John Broomes’ ruling on Wednesday stemmed from the prosecution of Tamori Morgan, who was charged with two counts of possessing a machine gun under federal law. Morgan cited the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in Bruen to argue that the case should be dismissed on Second Amendment grounds. Justice Clarence Thomas’ opinion for the Republican-appointed majority in Bruen said that gun regulations can’t stand unless they’re “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” The Kansas federal judge wrote that in Morgan’s case, the government failed to meet its burden “to demonstrate through historical analogs that regulation of the weapons at issue in this case are consistent with the nation’s history of firearms regulation.” The vast implications of Broomes’ ruling might not be fully realized if the government gets it reversed on appeal. The judge noted that the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Kansas and neighboring states, had yet to apply Bruen to the law at issue in Morgan’s case. There’s reason to think that even this Supreme Court could side with the government if the issue reaches the justices. Just this past term, in United States v. Rahimi, the court ruled 8-1 (over Thomas’ dissent) to uphold gun restrictions on people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence. The Rahimi case suggests that the court isn’t prepared to take the Bruen precedent as far as it could go. But in the meantime, chaos looms for gun laws and public safety — whether it’s due to the Supreme Court’s expansive gun jurisprudence, the misinterpretation of that jurisprudence by lower court judges, or both.

Why I’m (still) rooting for Jennifer Lopez to find true love,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-marriage-divorce-love-rcna168038,"When Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck tied the knot two years ago, nearly 20 years after they first became engaged, I was rooting for them. I’m a sucker for a good love story, and theirs read like a plot from one of the breezy paperbacks I pick up when I need an escape from reality. I understood that there was a strong possibility the union would last only slightly longer than it takes to read a romance novel. At 53, J.Lo didn’t have the greatest track record. Affleck is her fourth husband, the result of her sixth proposal. (Her collection of engagement rings is allegedly worth millions.) Also, Hollywood marriages tend to have the lifespan of a Drosophila. Still, when news broke earlier this week that Lopez had filed for divorce, I felt like Charlie Brown after Lucy yanks the football away. It wasn’t so much that the inevitable had happened, but that Lopez has once again failed in holding on to something she very publicly seems to covet: true, lasting love. I’m not in the habit of feeling sorry for celebrities, especially ones with great hair and perfectly toned bodies and the kind of disposable incomes that enable them to drop $20 million to make a behind-the-scenes documentary about their latest album and feature film. Also, I’m guessing that the last thing Jennifer Lopez wants right now is pity. But I can’t help it. I feel bad for her. I saw that documentary, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told.” It came out a few weeks after Valentine’s Day this year and I found it much more watchable than the weird feature film, “This is Me…Now: A Love Story,” that inspired it. I like human interest stories, and while I’m fully aware that Lopez is an excellent actor and maybe she was acting in the documentary, the romantic in me nonetheless bought what she was selling: true love, self-love, redemptive love… all the love. Not that there weren’t warning signs. Call me a cynic, but I’m certainly not the only one who is skeptical of over-the-top displays and proclamations of devotion. My first instinct is usually to wonder if there’s some overcompensation involved. If your love is that solid, do you need to tell everyone? Shouldn’t it be obvious? Even with J.Lo’s penchant for living private moments in public, the performative aspects of “Bennifer” gave me pause. Also, it was impossible to ignore that Affleck didn’t seem entirely on board with turning their love story into content. He reminded me of Warren Beatty in the 1991 documentary “Truth or Dare,” in which the iconic actor observed, frustratedly and disdainfully, that Madonna, his then-lover, “doesn’t want to live off-camera, much less talk.” Thirty-three years later, the publicity-shy Beatty is happily (we hope) married to the equally publicity-shy Annette Bening. Meanwhile, Madonna spent her 66th birthday posting long Instagram albums with her 28-year-old boyfriend at the same Italian resort where Lopez apparently holed up earlier this the summer. Could that be a harbinger of things to come? Eleven years from now, will a 66-year-old Lopez be back in Italy with her own 28-year-old boyfriend? Maybe. But that’s not the impression she’s given in interviews promoting the aforementioned documentary. Sure, she’s a glamorous Hollywood creature who exists on a rarefied plane high above the rest of us mere mortals, but at her core I believe that there’s a still part of her — the “Jenny from the Block” part, perhaps — who wants her happy ending. I can’t imagine she’s going to quit looking for it, but something has to change or we’re going to keep repeating the she’s-in-love-she’s-getting-married-it’s-over pattern ad infinitum. History has shown that’s not good for anybody. Plenty of people have been comparing Lopez and Affleck to Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, which is natural and tempting, but also feels like an easy out — and a curse. Anonymous, pro-Affleck sources in Page Six, for what they’re worth (not much), have been quoted summing up Affleck and Lopez’s life together as a “fever dream.” That doesn’t bode well for a reconciliation. As someone who bought my first copy of People magazine as a middle schooler 50 years ago, my fascination with the lifestyles of the rich and famous runs deep. I’d like to think I’m above falling into the pit of parasocial celebrity relationships — the potentially toxic cultural phenomenon wherein fans feel entitled to judge their stars. I’m not interested in judging — indeed what’s drawn me to the latest chapter of J.Lo’s search-for-love story is its humanity. Even someone who works so hard, is incredibly successful at what she does and looks great doing it is as human as the rest of us. It’s a lesson in reality: Nobody gets through this life without failures and frustrations. Ideally, we learn from our mistakes so we avoid repeating them — and if anybody has the resources to obtain an education, it’s J.Lo. I wish her well. I hope she finds that true love sooner rather than later. But in the meantime, I’ll be finding my happy endings at my local indie book store."
The DNC outperformed the RNC in a category that will probably vex Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 1:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/dnc-ratings-rnc-trump-tv-crowds-rcna168089,"As Democrats made the case for their presidential nominee this week, an average of 21.8 million viewers tuned in over four days to watch the events in Chicago, according to Nielsen data. Viewership numbers for the Democratic National Convention eclipsed the Republican National Convention’s 19.1 million average viewers in July. And, per Nielsen, the final night of the DNC, which featured Harris’ acceptance speech, drew 26.2 million viewers, slightly higher than the 25.3 million people who watched the last night of the Republican convention. Part of that may be due to the length of the nominees’ speeches: Harris’ clocked in at a relatively brief 38 minutes, while Trump’s went on for 92 minutes — the longest nomination acceptance speech on record. Curiosity and anticipation for Harris, whose candidacy has garnered a ton of enthusiasm among Democrats, may also explain the interest in the DNC. But other factors might have boosted viewership: The party rolled out A-list celebrity speakers like Oprah Winfrey and musical acts like Lil Jon and Pink, and there was intense speculation (that eventually proved unfounded) that Beyoncé would make an appearance on the final night of the convention to endorse Harris. Convention ratings are far from an accurate indicator of who will win an election. But those data points might vex the GOP nominee, who has long taken pride in his ability to draw a crowd. Trump’s fixation on TV ratings and crowd size are well documented, and his frustration with the large audiences that Harris has drawn at her campaign events in recent weeks has been obvious. He has falsely claimed that Harris used artificial intelligence to change a photo to inflate the number of attendees at her rally in Detroit — a claim he appeared to walk back days later. When asked how concerned he was about the audience at Harris’ rallies, Trump accused the media of being “dishonest” about his crowd sizes. He also suggested that more people turned out for his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 — which preceded the Capitol riots — than for Martin Luther King Jr.’s address during the March on Washington in 1963."
"Judge faults Breonna Taylor's boyfriend for her death, drops key charges against two cops",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 12:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/breonna-taylor-charges-dismissed-officers-rcna168070,"A Kentucky judge ruled that Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend's decision to open fire is the legal cause of her fatal shooting by police officers, throwing out federal charges against two officers who allegedly falsified a drug warrant that led to police breaking down her door and killing her in 2020. In a decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Simpson III dismissed felony deprivation of rights charges against former Louisville Police Detective Joshua Jaynes, who was accused of knowingly drafting a false search warrant affidavit on Taylor’s home, and former Sgt. Kyle Meany, who approved the warrant. Three plainclothes Louisville police officers, Brett Hankison, Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, executed the search warrant on Taylor’s home on March 13, 2020. Startled awake by pounding on the door, Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he assumed it was a break-in and fired a shot in the dark, which struck Mattingly. The officers fired 32 shots in return, killing Taylor. The judge ruled that “there is no direct link between the warrantless entry and Taylor’s death,” writing that Jaynes and Meany were not involved in the raid on Taylor’s home. Instead, he wrote, it was Walker’s decision to open fire that was the legal cause of Taylor’s death. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced federal charges against Jaynes, Meany and two other officers in 2022. Simpson’s ruling on Thursday means that Jaynes and Meany, who could have faced life in prison had they been found guilty on the felony charges, now face only misdemeanor charges related to covering up the allegedly false search warrant and lying to investigators. Both men have pleaded not guilty to all charges. There has not yet been an objective accounting of the chaos during Taylor’s fatal shooting. Her family has long disputed police accounts of what happened at her home that night, and the officers who executed the warrant have given differing versions of the events. None of the officers used body cameras during the operation. Taylor’s family said in a statement to The Associated Press that prosecutors told them they plan to appeal Simpson’s ruling. “Obviously we are devastated at the moment by the judge’s ruling with which we disagree and are just trying to process everything,” they said. “The only thing we can do at this point is continue to be patient. ... We will continue to fight until we get full justice for Breonna Taylor.”"
The DNC showed how the Democrats are willing to accept the unacceptable on Gaza,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 10:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-gaza-israel-kamala-harris-rcna167973,"Before the Democratic National Convention kicked off, a big question on my mind was, “How is the party going to address the crisis in the Gaza Strip?” We now have an answer: by sweeping it under the rug. Over the course of four days of lively speeches — infused with an extra excitement around Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the unexpected party nominee — the Biden administration’s backing of Israel’s barbarous military operation in the Gaza Strip rarely came up. It reflects a gamble by the Democratic Party that it can win the election by snubbing the movement objecting to it, by pretending that the U.S. is not supplying munitions used in atrocities. Despite a constant refrain about standing up for the little guy, calls for the protection of Palestinian civilians were all but absent. Despite all the rhetoric about a big tent, speakers and programming ignored the thousands of protesters outside the convention calling for a change in U.S. foreign policy toward Gaza. Despite all the calls for inclusivity and the showcasing of several Republican speakers, Democratic officials rejected a request from the “Uncommitted” movement to allow a Palestinian American to speak from the main stage. Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian American and one of the Democrats backed by the Uncommitted movement as a potential speaker, shared the speech she wanted to deliver with Mother Jones. That speech, which the Uncommitted movement said it was open to having vetted and edited, was a far cry from a radical text. In keeping with the overall party position, it called for a cease-fire and for Democrats to mobilize for Harris — and singled out Trump as bad for Palestinians. But it would have drawn more attention to the Palestinian civilians who are being killed en masse in Gaza, and it hinted at the possibility of policy change. The DNC gave a substantial speaking slot to the parents of an Israeli American man who was tragically abducted on Oct. 7 during Hamas’ vicious attacks on Israel. The speakers framed their plea for a cease-fire and the release of Hamas’ hostages as an apolitical, humanitarian demand. If the DNC had wanted to give an equivalent speaker a platform to discuss the experience of Americans with Palestinian relatives suffering or killed in Gaza, that would’ve been easy. But in reality none of these speeches are truly apolitical — as evidenced by the DNC’s decision to allow a family tied to only one side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to speak. From that choice, it’s hard to conclude anything other than that in the Democratic establishment’s eyes, Israeli lives matter more than Palestinian lives. However, I believe that even a purely “apolitical” speech by a Palestinian American calling attention to the horrors that abound in Gaza would have had its own issues. What’s happening in region is in fact not some kind of natural disaster: Human rights observers and scholars of genocide — a number of them Israeli — have characterized Israel’s ongoing conduct in Gaza as perpetrating genocide. What’s needed is not thoughts and prayers and vague acknowledgements of suffering. What’s needed are policy changes, with the U.S. ending its exceptional and effectively unconditional financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel. The handful of times that DNC speakers mentioned the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation in Gaza was mentioned only briefly, if at all. President Joe Biden and Harris both called for a cease-fire and acknowledged that people in Gaza are suffering. (Some pundits thought Harris used new language suggesting she may stand to the left of Biden on the issue. Those pundits are wrong.) But the Biden administration’s ongoing reliance on “we’re working on a cease-fire” rhetoric appears to be sly positioning. It allows Biden and Harris to sound sympathetic to the pro-Palestinian left. But, crucially, the language makes no commitment to change or condition a single element of the U.S. relationship toward Israel. For example, the United States’ best leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who has dragged his feet in the negotiation process — on a cease-fire that actually respects Palestinian autonomy is to credibly threaten to cut off the unending supply of military and financial resources. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s speech offered perhaps the most striking indication of the party’s position on Gaza. As I wrote earlier this week, the congresswoman from New York called for a cease-fire but omitted any mention of the people in Gaza or a need for policy change. As one of the most influential progressives in Congress, her speech suggested that even the left wing of the party has abdicated its commitment to fighting injustice abroad for the sake of message discipline. On an electoral level, addressing Gaza is difficult for the Democratic Party. It’s a genuine wedge issue, with younger and more progressive Democrats critical of Democratic policy and older, more conservative Democrats unmoved by or supportive of what’s happening. A move in any direction invariably infuriates different constituencies within the party. But ultimately the Democrats may be banking on the theory that deflecting from the issue is the least costly approach since it isn’t a top-tier issue for most young voters. Moreover, Harris’ surprise nomination may very well have slowed down the momentum the pro-Palestinian movement had built around pressuring Biden. Protests at the DNC, while sizable, were smaller than expected. And it is conceivable that disenchanted Arab American voters in Michigan could be less averse to Harris, who has used ambiguous, noncommittal language to her advantage. But Democrats’ position, as manifested in their convention, is still a costly one. By shunning promises of change, they increase the odds that the policy status quo will prevail, since politicians tend to try to fulfill pledges and view breaking them as damaging. It is a moral stain on the party, and it helps to further normalize a racialized tolerance for killing innocents (something that America tried to reckon with in 2020 but failed to deliver on). How can Democrats consider themselves progressive while backing a regime with such blatant disregard for human life? It is also perilous for U.S. strategic interests for it to blindly support Israel’s military operations. The military operation in Gaza is increasing the likelihood of regional war in a region of acute geopolitical importance. And the U.S. erodes its soft power and ability to build alliances against adversaries like Russia when the world can see the U.S. has no consistent values when it comes to standing against domination. The party’s choices this week indicate that it is willing to continue to accept what should be unacceptable. It is betting the way to keep its coalition together is to avoid the issue, to keep the status quo intact and, when discussing the issue, to sometimes engage in a brief pantomime of concern for civilian life. Gaza is going the way of the liberal land acknowledgement — ritualistic virtue-signaling atop a kind of resignation toward the annihilation of a civilization."
'A betrayal': RFK Jr.'s family members decry his endorsement of Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 8:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-endorsement-family-rcna168068,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s family members have denounced his decision to endorse Donald Trump after he dropped out of the presidential race, calling it a “betrayal” of their family’s values. In a statement released shortly after Kennedy announced Friday that he is suspending his independent bid for president and backing the Republican nominee, five of his siblings reiterated their support for the Democratic ticket and criticized their brother. “Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,” they wrote. “It is a sad ending to a sad story.” The statement was signed by five of his eight surviving siblings: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Chris Kennedy and Rory Kennedy. Kennedy’s family members have been open about their disdain for his long-shot presidential bid. Several of them publicly backed President Joe Biden in April, and they have continued to support the Harris-Walz ticket since Biden stepped aside. A member of the famed Democratic political dynasty endorsing Trump would have been unthinkable even 18 months ago. But the 70-year-old anti-vaccine activist’s distrust in government has appeal on the right, and his penchant for conspiracy theories aligns with Trump’s own leanings. In his speech in Arizona on Friday, Kennedy railed against what he called Democrats’ “continual legal warfare” against him and Trump, and he accused the media of engaging in a conspiracy with Democrats to hinder his campaign. Kennedy also acknowledged that his involvement with Trump’s campaign “will be a difficult sacrifice for my wife and children” but is “worthwhile” to save children from processed foods and obesity. At a campaign rally later on Friday, Trump praised Kennedy — an opponent he once called “the most radical left candidate in the race” — as a “great person.” Kennedy’s endorsement may ultimately carry little weight, however. He had been performing poorly in polls and his campaign’s fundraising had been in dire straits in recent months. But the Trump campaign may be banking on Kennedy bringing enough supporters to tip the scales in what is set to be a tight election, especially in critical swing states."
These fact-checks about Trump are accurate — but they completely miss the point,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-fact-check-dnc-video-rcna167571,"It’s been a rough week for fact-checkers, as many of their most loyal readers lost patience with their approach to the job. The low point came Monday. A video at the Democratic National Convention showed a clip of Donald Trump saying in 2016 that “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions. Someone at PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit, then posted on X a link to an old fact check on the issue rating criticism of this quote “mostly false.” “He walked back the comment the same day,” the post noted. “We found no evidence that he currently supports legal penalties for women who have abortions.” A community note soon appeared beneath the post. “It is incorrect to say that showing an unedited video of Trump’s own words is ‘false,’” it said. “Reporting from 2016 confirms that this is something Trump said. Even if he walked it back following criticism, it is not false to accurately quote something Trump said.” Take it from me, a former fact-checker: There is nothing lower than this. Having your own facts checked by users of X — not Twitter, but Elon Musk’s vastly degraded version of it — is like watching an NBA player get dunked on by a 14-year-old kid. A reporter for The Washington Post also took heat for a quick fact check of President Joe Biden’s convention speech, in which Biden said that Trump would refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. “But that’s not true,” the reporter wrote. “Trump just hasn’t said that he would accept. And he has previously said the only way he loses is if the Democrats cheat.” This is looking-glass logic. Trump is literally refusing to accept a loss already when he says he can’t lose. These weren’t isolated incidents either. Fact-checkers have also raised hackles recently when they said: These fact checks were all very thoroughly reported, with relevant details and useful context. But they all faced the same problem: They completely missed the point. Some of this is due to a basic courtesy that fact-checkers pretty much have to extend to people running for office. If a candidate promises to do something — or not do something — fact-checkers take them at their word. PolitiFact even maintains a “Promise Tracker” to check whether each presidential campaign pledge is kept or broken. There’s good reason for that. Research has shown that candidates try to keep their promises, contrary to what the cynics think. And to be fair, in most cases there’s no real way to fact-check what may happen in the future other than what a campaign says. But Trump is not like other politicians. PolitiFact’s own Promise Tracker found that he broke 53% of his promises in his term, compared to 23% for Barack Obama and just 3% for Biden. When a fact-checker smacks down a Democrat by noting that Trump has promised not to do something, it ignores that Trump has more often than not broken his promises. Normal candidates also try not to lie. Again, I know that’s not what cynics believe, but politicians who get fact-checked on a certain line will typically drop it or revise it to be more accurate in response. (I once had a rather tense lunch with a campaign staffer who wanted me to retract a fact-check so they could keep using the line.) But Trump’s own former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said at the Democratic convention that he has “no fidelity to the truth” and told her to simply repeat things until people believed them. There’s no simple solution here. Some of these pieces would have been just fine if they weren’t billed as “fact checks.” My advice would be to go ahead and share the context of what Trump said about injecting bleach, but don’t split hairs over what he meant with his bizarre ramblings. And if fact-checkers do have to make a judgment call, I’d advise that they not get tangled up in semantic games and focus on the big picture. If there’s any consolation for the fact-checkers from this last week, it’s that people are upset. That’s a sign that voters still care about the facts — even when politicians don’t."
How Tim Walz’s dumb taco joke broke MAGA brains,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-white-guy-tacos-harris-campaign-video-trump-ann-coulter-rcna167678,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz broke MAGA brains for the second time in a month — and he wasn’t even calling them “weird” this time. He was making fun of himself. Prior to winning the Democratic veepstakes, Walz mocked the hypocrisy of the GOP’s “freedom” branding despite its support for abortion bans, educational censorship and hostility to LGBTQ people. When he called them “weird” for that, pundits from both the party of Trump and the MAGA-adjacent faux-center gasped in horror and suggested that in slamming Donald Trump and JD Vance, he’d attacked half the country. More recently, they lost their minds about Walz making a completely forgettable quip — calling it a joke gives it way too much credit — about how he eats “white guy tacos.” What’s a white guy taco to Walz? “Pretty much ground beef and cheese.” Then he mumbled another throwaway line about black pepper being as hot a spice as his region prefers. These quotes are from a campaign video where Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris do their best attempt at a buddy banter clip — the kind of humanizing campaign advertising that’s so normal it’s hardly ever noticed. Since at least the dawn of television, presidential and vice presidential candidates have tried to sell themselves as just regular people, not highly ambitious politicians working together to secure the most powerful position in the world. That’s all this video was. An advertisement. But to some of the toughest-talking, eff-your-feelings MAGA pundits, it was a hate crime. It was proof that Walz is a fraud and possibly a traitor to his race. Ben Shapiro, generally regarded as a high-level conservative public intellectual, didn’t find Walz’s dumb Midwestern dad joke funny. The author of tweets accusing Colin Powell of being an “affirmative action general” responded with: “See, folks, it’s funny that white people hate spices! Not racist at all! Just funny!” Then he added a fact check about Europeans fighting wars over the spice trade. Shapiro later devoted an entire segment on his show to making these same points. Then came the sleuths who insisted Walz was also a liar. A famous Pizzagate propagator uncovered the awful truth: Walz won a recipe contest! And it was taco-related! To prove he had the goods, the Pizzagate guy shared a screenshot of the ingredients Walz used: paprika, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, olive oil. And mild green chiles and a bottle of medium taco sauce. The dish was called “Tim’s Turkey Taco Tot Hotdish.” It’s based on ground turkey, cheese, sour cream and sweet corn. It’s served with tater tots. It is literally a Midwestern meat and potatoes casserole with a Taco Bell kids menu level of spice. Though that recipe is hardly proof that Walz is a secret spice guy, one right-wing influencer with a huge audience claimed, “He has to appeal to the white guilt crowd now so he is changing his position on spices.” Even Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., got in on the Walz Tacogate pile-on, slamming Walz for denying his true seasoning legacy. Foreign policy writer Nicholas Grossman summarized this curious phenomenon well: “Right-wing podcasters: Oh so when I make mean-spirited disparaging comments about other races it’s wrong, but when Tim Walz makes a mild dad joke at his own race’s expense it’s ok? How is that fair? I’m the victim here. Yes, again.” A political science professor described their expressed outrage as “ambient victimhood.” In the current state of the culture wars, the MAGA right and its enablers have hair-trigger offense reactions. And some of them are openly debasing themselves as their fragility leads them to viciously lash out at their liberal tormentors. An “anti-woke” account with nearly 3 million followers posted a short video showing Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, with her arm draped casually around her dad during the Democratic National Convention. The caption read: “This is Kamala’s family. Beyond parody.” I honestly can’t fathom what they’re mad about. Ella’s tattoos? Her short hair? That she and her father appear genuinely relaxed around each other? Ann Coulter — inarguably one of the meanest people in the political discourse for decades — was triggered by a photo of Walz’s son, Gus, shedding tears of joy as his father accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president. She wrote, “Talk about weird…” Again, what is she offended by? Is the image of a young male publicly expressing deep emotion part of a feminist conspiracy to lower the population or something? I mean, even Shapiro conceded the moment was “really quite nice.” Coulter went too far even by MAGA standards of decorum and hence deleted the X post attacking the teenager, but this is what the anti-snowflake movement has become: people who flip out over a politician’s anodyne self-deprecating joke and Democrats’ children doing normal things when caught on candid camera. This is late-stage MAGA. Some of the most vicious people in politics and commentary are unironically freaking out over people doing normal, apolitical things. They are irrationally hypersensitive, proclaiming their victimhood as they scour for woke scolds and creeping communism under every sofa cushion. It’s grievance culture of the right-wing variety. And it’s very weird."
Ruben Gallego's DNC speech highlighted an important truth about Latino voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-speech-ruben-gallego-arizona-latino-voters-rcna168044,"Now that the Democratic National Convention is over and the final leg of the 2024 presidential campaign season begins, it’s crystal clear that Vice President Kamala Harris is trending up with Latino voters.  Still, the question remains: Will it be enough in November? Before providing a possible answer, it’s essential to summarize why Democrats are back in the game regarding the country’s largest ethnic voting cohort, projected to be 36.2 million eligible voters this cycle, potentially resulting in a 6.5% turnout increase from 2020.  When President Joe Biden was still in the race, a post-debate Pew Research Center poll of Latino voters showed him tied at 36% nationally with Donald Trump. The way things were going, Biden was on course to get the least Latino support for a Democratic candidate since Jimmy Carter’s 56% in 1980. One month after Biden decided not to seek a second term, a new Pew poll had Harris with a 17-point lead (52% - 35%) over Trump. Although it is not the historical level of mid-60% Latino support for Democratic presidential candidates, and still below the Jimmy Carter number, it’s a dramatic swing in just one month. It also aligns with other Latino voters' polls from August, showing Harris making up most of the ground Biden lost and bringing on what one polling firm has called a “Latino reset.”  The news during DNC week continued that trend. Additional polling from Axios says Harris has “closed a 15-point enthusiasm gap with Latino voters in the weeks since President Biden dropped his re-election bid.” Data from two Latino organizations that work to increase Latino voter awareness echo the Axios enthusiasm findings, noting that “73% of registered Latino voters are almost certain they will vote in the 2024 Presidential election” and has Harris with a 59%-35% lead over Trump. On Wednesday morning, Voto Latino, an organization that endorsed Harris in July, revealed a new battleground state polling of Latinos, with Trump dropping to 29% and Harris reaching 60%. There is a lot at stake for Harris and Democrats. According to UnidosUS, 20% of Latinos will be voting for the first time in 2024. But that new, younger electorate is more politically independent than ever. New Latino voters don’t mean new Democratic voters. There is work to be done.  There is no guarantee that the Harris campaign will solidify more Latinos into the Democratic fold. For example, Wednesday night’s DNC tough-on-immigration talk and calls for a more balanced approach might align with where the majority of Latinos are these days, but the situation is complicated. This year, Democrats have had an uneasy stance on the issue. Even if Democrats featured several prominent Latino and Latino voices this week in Chicago, they are still sending mixed messages in the hopes of appealing to undecided Republicans and progressive Latino supporters.  So the question remains: Can Harris close the deal with Latinos and increase support? A Thursday prime-time podium speaker on track to become his state’s first Latino senator helped to answer that question. Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, a proud progressive, has consistently led opponent and Trump loyalist Kari Lake in all polling this summer. His DNC speech focused on his humble beginnings and how he eventually got accepted to Harvard and served in the Marines. Other Democratic officials who also served in the Armed Forces took the stage during Gallego’s speech, marking a moment. Importantly, Gallego never led with his Latino heritage. Rather, he presented himself to Democrats as a Senate candidate looking to expand his coalition, who happens to be Latino. The positive crowd response suggested that he has a winning formula not only for Latinos in his state but also Republicans and independents. And the key is a pivot to the middle that might rankle the Latino left, but delivers a working-class and populist message that Democrats need to keep hammering for the 11 weeks left until Election Day. Gallego hinted at this messaging earlier this year when he spoke to me, saying the “true Latino” vote in his state is “not influenced by an East Coast-West Coast bias that comes from the pundits,” and that, while “it comes from liberals sometimes, too. It also comes from conservatives.” Gallego’s focus on the military and veterans was politically smart. Immigration will always be a contentious issue, but don’t discount the Latino connection to the armed forces. According to a 2022 Department of Defense report, Latinos comprised 18.4% of active-duty members.  There are also economic messages Democrats tend to overlook when it comes to Latinos. For instance, little is being said about the 18 million new business applications under the Biden-Harris administration, with Latinos accounting for 40% of those numbers. Or how the Affordable Care Act has, according to the Biden-Harris administration, resulted in 15 million Latinos getting health insurance. The cost of living, the economy and health care are top issues for Latinos. There’s a reason why Trump and Republicans are trying to play up those topics with Latinos. And it is no coincidence that Gallego was on the main stage Thursday night, the same night Harris formally accepted the nomination. Arizona is a critical swing state and Gallego understands the messiness of Latinidad; he realizes that the Latino politically independent streak can benefit Democrats. No one group will propel Democrats to victory, but a coalition that expands the tent and admits that Latinos have indeed been taken for granted has a better shot. It’s a message Harris would be wise to use for the rest of her campaign if she wishes to continue trending up with an electorate that is such a vital part of the American vote."
Team Harris' DNC approach offered a classic lesson in political communication,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-dnc-masterclass-immigration-trump-rcna168037,"The Democratic National Convention was a joyful, inclusive reminder of what politics is supposed to feel like. And Vice President Kamala Harris ended the week by delivering a fierce, patriotic and refreshing speech that combined her positive vision for the country with an absolute takedown of Donald Trump. She looked and sounded like she was going to walk off that stage right into the Oval Office. But it’s important to remember that this race is far from over. It is going to be a grind. It is going to be nasty, and Trump and MAGA land are going to do everything they can to take her down. One of the issues the Trump campaign is betting on is immigration. But what this week also showed us is that Harris and her campaign are not going to avoid the hot-button topic. They are going to address it head-on. In her speech on Thursday, Harris smartly emphasized her border record and the ways she has advocated for increased security. She gave us a preview of how she will challenge Trump during the Sept. 10 presidential debate stage. “I refuse to play politics with our security,” she told the convention. “And here is my pledge to you: As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.” And this theme was present during earlier convention nights as well. Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar took the stage on Wednesday with a speech ready-made for a campaign ad. Salazar highlighted how Trump’s actions led to the collapse of the most prominent border reform bill in recent history. The appearance underscored how much Democrats do care about border security, and reaffirmed their commitment to the tough conversations. This strategy isn’t just talk. Rep. Tom Suozzi, who won a tough special election in February to replace GOP Rep. George Santos, successfully embraced this same strategy. He addressed immigration issues directly and demonstrated that Democrats can be both strong on security and compassionate in policy. This is a classic lesson in political communication: When facing a perceived weakness, confront it head-on. And on Wednesday and again on Thursday, we saw the Harris team do just that. On Sept. 5, Trump will host an event at his Bedminster golf club honoring those convicted for their roles in the 2021 Capitol attack. Billed as the “J6 Awards Gala,” the event will include a raffle for a plaque commemorating a song by Trump and the “J6 Prison Choir,” composed of Jan. 6 defendants. This gala is more than just a fundraiser. It’s also another warning highlighting Trump’s ongoing efforts to rewrite history. And it’s a chilling reminder of the lengths Trump will go to reshape reality. (Although with $400 million in legal fees hanging over his head, Trump could probably use a fundraising gala of his own). Coach Walz had us all feeling like Minnesota state champions when former members of his football team took the DNC stage on Wednesday night. Ben Ingman, a track athlete and former student of Walz’s, recalled the time his former teacher helped push Ingman’s car out of a snowbank, just one of many examples of Walz’s lifelong generosity. I spoke with both Ingman and Sean Kooman, a state champion kicker, on our show after their DNC appearance. “It really feels kind of like magic,” Kooman told me. “I’ve never met anybody with as much integrity as him.” This may be the most Americana DNC I’ve ever been a part of, and I’m here for it. Moments like these remind us what true leadership looks like: grounded in community, integrity and simple acts of kindness. As President Barack Obama said, Tim Walz is exactly the kind of person who should be in politics. This week Luke Russert, the host and creative director of MSNBC Live, wrote a powerful piece on the enduring significance of party conventions and why we shouldn’t take them for granted. During our conversation, I asked Luke about his experience at this DNC and why, like many of us, he was so deeply moved by Walz’s heartfelt speech. Reflecting on the moment, Luke said, “Anybody watching that with a soul left knows, ‘Hey, this is a good guy.’ The way his son just cheered for him brought me back to so many memories of my own childhood, cheering on my father, and knowing that my father loved me.” What show are you bingeing right now? My wife got me hooked on “Bridgerton,” which I should say I happily enjoyed. But the show I binge constantly and rewatch is “Conan O’Brien Must Go.” Conan’s humor is getting better with age. What’s the last book you read? I read two at the same time: An old-school gem “Post Office” by Charles Bukowski and a galley copy of “The Barn: A Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi” written by my friend Wright Thompson. “The Barn” comes out in a month and will be the book of the year. It’s the best thing I’ve read in quite a while. What time do you wake up on the weekends? Usually by 9:30 a.m. I’m a night owl so it can be a sliding scale, but my pug pretty much makes the call. How do you take your coffee? Black. But I’m very strange because I will drink one cup hot and then one iced right after, and for the rest of the day."
Beyoncé didn't show — but the DNC's celebrities blew the RNC's out of the water,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:26 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/beyonce-pink-dnc-celebrities-trump-rnc-rcna168029,"After hours of breathless speculation, deleted tweets and one very incorrect TMZ report, Beyoncé did not show up at the Democratic National Convention last night. It was a disappointing, if entirely predictable, outcome. And many, many other stars did grace the convention stage. Both Republican and Democratic convention organizers worked hard to secure headline-making names to drum up attention, followed hopefully by votes and possibly donations. But even without Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, it was clear that only one party truly understood the assignment. At the DNC, Democrats used celebrities across all four days to promote the specific policies of the party, and to connect each celebrity’s brand with their brand. On Thursday night, the convention featured Pink, a singer who has used her music to fight for LGBTQ+ equality long before it became fashionable, and The Chicks, who boldly risked their careers in country music to speak out against right-wing militarism.  Comedian D.L. Hughley, known for his clever commentary on race, took the stage to hilariously call out Trump’s race-baiting politics. Common and John Legend, both known for music that advocates and celebrates the quest for racial justice, took the stage earlier in the week. And Oprah Winfrey, an iconic figure who famously overcame the obstacles of race, class and gender to become a billionaire cultural behemoth, endorsed Harris’ historic quest to do the same. Trailblazing director Spike Lee watched from the crowd as barrier-breaking actresses Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling helped host. And heard throughout was the official campaign song, Beyoncé's “Freedom,” the rare instance of a singer and song matching the message and meaning of a political campaign. Contrast this with the strange Republican mélange of Kid Rock, Amber Rose, Russell Brand, reality star Savannah Chrisley, UFC head honcho Dana White and Hulk Hogan that assembled a few short weeks ago in Milwaukee. These celebrities didn’t reinforce any message or create any vibe. They certainly didn’t connect to any policy. Some seemed to contradict the actual policies of the reality TV candidate they were allegedly endorsing, leading to such outlandish moments as Amber Rose saying Trump is “all love.” Rose probably should have watched more of the actual RNC speakers, who spent much of the convention advocating for bigotry and hate. The biggest theme of the RNC celebrity choices, if you can call it a theme, was that “Trump is cool.” One could argue this is an actual political strategy, based on wooing young male voters. But even then, it’s unclear how widespread the 71-year-old Hulk Hogan’s fan base is anymore. Kid Rock has recently made more headlines for boycotting beer than he has for any particularly artistic endeavor. And Amber Rose is … barely a celebrity. This isn’t to say that Democrats always get celebrity politics right. As someone who worked on the 2016 Democratic convention, it’s clear to me now that we failed to connect many of the celebrities to any meaningful message or strategy. Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz performed, and both Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver took to the stage — but it wasn’t always clear why. What were they saying about the campaign Hillary Clinton was waging against Donald Trump? Similarly, when Robert De Niro showed up at Trump’s hush money trial, his appearance seemed like a tabloid distraction. A better strategy would have been to have a pro-choice female celebrity connect Trump’s sexist behavior with his sexist policies and discuss how Trump wants to put the government in our bedroom, while expecting privacy in his.  Why does any of this matter? We can never know for sure, but in the same way that Will Rogers’ everyman persona helped FDR position himself as the champion of ordinary Americans, or the Italian Catholic Frank Sinatra reinforced Irish Catholic JFK’s message of generational change, a good celebrity surrogate can complement, bolster and spread a candidate's message. And in the end, the DNC’s parade of celebrities did do a good job of connecting their own stories and star power to Harris’ message of “not going back.” Meanwhile, the celebrities at the RNC tried, and mostly failed, to make Trump look cool again. But to be fair to them, I’m not sure anybody could."
Ex-MMA fighter Ronda Rousey apologizes for once sharing a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ronda-rousey-sandy-hook-conspiracy-apology-rcna168002,"Ronda Rousey, a former professional mixed martial artist, apologized for amplifying a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory 11 years ago, after the incident resurfaced in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session earlier this week. In a lengthy statement she posted on social media Thursday night, Rousey recounted watching a conspiracy video about the mass shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were killed at a Connecticut elementary school, and then reposting the video on Twitter (now X) in early 2013. “I didn’t even believe it, but was so horrified at the truth that I was grasping for an alternative fiction to cling to instead,” she wrote. “I quickly realized my mistake and took it down, but the damage was done.” Rousey said her post went largely unnoticed by the media and she “never spoke of it again.” (It did spark some backlash at the time, and Rousey responded that she “never meant to hurt or insult anyone.”) She also said that she had “redrafted this apology” multiple times over the past 11 years. Rousey added: The Sandy Hook shooting is one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. Conspiracy theories about the massacre, often promoted by right-wing figures, have been rampant and are deeply damaging. Families of the victims and survivors have experienced death threats and harassment for years as a result. Infowars host Alex Jones was a major proponent of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories. After a prolonged legal battle with the victims’ families, Jones was ordered in 2022 to pay them a total of $1.5 billion in damages. In June this year, a judge granted his request to liquidate his personal assets to pay some of what he owed the families. Apologies from celebrities for public missteps can often come across as perfunctory exercises in damage control. Rousey’s statement comes more than a decade after her post and only after she was recently called out for it online. But, as far as such apologies go, her acknowledgement of the harm she caused and the repercussions she should have faced for it lend her apology a credibility others have lacked. Rousey also had some words of advice to those who have been taken in by conspiracy theories:"
Trump professes his love for dubious stop-and-frisk policing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 2:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-stop-frisk-new-york-police-fox-news-interview-rcna168003,"In a Fox News interview Thursday, Donald Trump all but guaranteed that a victory for him in November would lead to increased use of stop and frisk, the police practice known to facilitate racial profiling. The former president, who of course has been convicted of felonies himself, has endorsed the tactic in the past. He voiced support again Thursday while also endorsing the confiscation of guns, which certainly undercuts the GOP’s Second Amendment absolutism. During his meandering “Fox and Friends” interview, Trump said: Just like officials who have relied on stop-and-frisk policies over the years, Trump spoke in generalities to justify his approach. Police do not know everything about everyone walking down the street, and, in fact, there’s ample evidence that such stops are rather fruitless endeavors that do little to stem crime and often subject racial and ethnic minorities to bias and violations of their civil rights. The New York state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, for example, compiled data from the New York Police Department — which saw a federal judge find its stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional in 2013 — showing that the majority of the people stopped over the past two decades have been people of color and a “vastly disproportionate” number were Black. In addition, the ACLU found that the “overwhelming majority of people stopped by the NYPD have been innocent, meaning the NYPD found no evidence of wrongdoing and the civilian was not given a summons or arrested.” So why is Trump backing it? I suspect there are two reasons. First, Trump has been known to promote false and outright racist allegations about Black and Latino people on his own, so it follows that he would endorse a policy that allows police to do the same. And secondly, his claims about wanting police to be unencumbered helps distract some people from something we already know after his guilty verdicts and massive civil penalties: He doesn’t have any regard for the law."

At a speech during the Fed’s annual August summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell said ‘the time has come for policy to adjust.’ His remarks come as price growth has slowed and the jobs market, as well as demand for borrowing money, has begun to soften to a weaker level than before the onset of the pandemic.” * Ukraine steps up strikes in Russia: “As Ukrainian forces fight to isolate a large group of Russian soldiers caught between a river in Russia’s Kursk Province and the Ukrainian border, Kyiv has launched a series of strikes at airfields, ports and oil depots in other regions of Russia aimed at degrading the Kremlin’s war effort.” * Difficult diplomacy: “The White House said Friday that cease-fire talks in Cairo have been constructive and will continue over the weekend as the U.S. and Mideast allies continue to press Israel and Hamas to forge an agreement. CIA Director William Burns and Brett McGurk, a senior adviser on the Middle East to President Joe Biden, are leading the U.S. side of negotiations that began on Thursday amid major differences between Israel and Hamas over Israel’s insistence that it maintain forces in two strategic corridors in Gaza.” * A case worth watching: “Texas and 15 other Republican-led states sued the Biden administration on Friday seeking to halt a new program that could give legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens. Filed just days after the program opened for applications, the lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal actions Texas has led challenging federal immigration policies and powers.” * This NLRB story was overshadowed this week, but it’s important: “Prosecutors at a federal labor agency have determined that Amazon is a joint employer of subcontracted drivers who delivered packages for the company in California, pushing back on claims from the online retailer that they are not its employees. The decision, made by a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles, came after the agency investigated unfair labor practice charges filed against the company by the Teamsters union.” * The latest Jan. 6 arrest: “A live-streamer who was a frequent presence at the ‘Freedom Corner’ protests in support of Jan. 6 defendants has been arrested on Capitol attack charges, nearly two years after he was publicly identified by online ‘sedition hunters’ who have aided in hundreds of Jan. 6 arrests.” * In related news: “A Maryland man who threw a smoke bomb at police officers defending the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and who later became a police officer himself in Montgomery County, was convicted Friday of civil disorder, assaulting police and other charges.” * The governor might need to pick up a new hobby: “Data obtained by NBC News seems to indicate that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott did not send a single bus full of migrants out of the state in July, despite his vow at the Republican National Convention on July 17 to keep sending buses north until the border is ‘secure.’” Have a safe weekend."
"Trump's 'dog' insults come back to bite him as he courts Kennedy, Kemp support",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 2:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-kemp-kennedy-like-a-dog-rcna168016,"Donald Trump has a phrase he likes to use to describe people he believes are in weak, pitiful or even servile positions: “Like a dog.”  As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out in 2020, Trump has used the phrase to attack a host of people, from retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal (who was “fired like a dog”) to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who was “dumped like a dog”) and conservative activist Brent Bozell (who was once “begging for money like a dog”).  It seems fitting to revive the phrase now that the tables have turned on Trump, who’s exhibited some canine qualities of his own recently by nuzzling up to some of the men he’s barked at in the past. With Kamala Harris atop the Democratic ticket, and an election victory more in doubt, Trump now appears more willing to roll over for people who previously drew his ire.  Take Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, for example. For years now, Trump has publicly attacked Kemp for refusing to help overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory in Georgia, and he publicly bashed the governor and his wife earlier this month, prompting Kemp to tell Trump to “leave my family out of it.” Many Republicans said Trump’s outburst might hurt his election chances in Georgia. And whether it was that, the palpable energy of Georgia’s Democratic National Convention delegation, or recent polling data forecasting a close race in Georgia, Trump's tweet touting Kemp suggests he’s feeling the heat. He said: That’s a good boy who's learned to muzzle himself ... for now. Perhaps some belly scratches are on the way. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, spoke with Kemp the night before Trump praised him, CNN reported. (Neither NBC News nor MSNBC has independently confirmed that report.) Perhaps Vance's reported visit was meant to smooth things over? Either way, we’ve seen a similar about-face from Trump when it comes to Trump’s stance on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier this year, Trump’s strategy for combating Kennedy’s independent presidential bid, and its appeal to some Trump voters, involved lobbing personal attacks at Kennedy and his family. But since entering the race, polling suggests Harris is winning over some independent voters, making Kennedy’s candidacy all the more perilous for Trump’s campaign. That likely explains why Trump reportedly spoke with Kennedy recently to discuss a potential Cabinet position should Kennedy drop out of the race. On Friday, Kennedy withdrew from the race, stating in a speech that Trump had asked to ""enlist me in his administration."" He went on endorse Trump in his speech. A day earlier, Trump called into Fox News and heaped praise on Kennedy: These are the kinds of fawning statements one might expect from a candidate who — much like the “dogs” he despises — has been brought to heel."

Overnight, following a blockbuster speech at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala became the candidate of change.  I’m sure that terrifies the Trump campaign. If you look historically at presidential elections, people who make up their minds at the end tend to go toward the candidate they think is most likely to change things. Right now, that’s not Trump. The most effective way Harris made her case to the American people on Thursday was how she connected the stages of her career with a common purpose. During her time as a prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator, and then a vice president, Harris noted that she “only had one client: the people.” She contrasted that directly with Trump, declaring “the only client he has ever had: himself.” I’m sure the Harris campaign was very happy to wake up to headlines across the country about the “new way forward.” She is no longer just somebody who is the vice president. She is a presidential candidate.  This week, Democrats pulled off what many thought was impossible for a sitting vice president — taking away the cloak of incumbency. Kamala Harris is now the new kid in town.

The Democratic National Convention reached a crescendo Thursday when Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination. Throughout the week, it’s been clear to me that everyone in that building — and definitely everyone on the stage — understood the assignment in front of them. They know there’s a fight ahead, one that's approaching fast. In some states, voters can cast their ballot as soon as early September. Make no mistake, this is going to be a close election. When President Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, I was one of the people who believed the race between him and former President Donald Trump was so close not because people didn’t like Biden but because they liked what Trump was selling. While some moments this week felt like a huge celebration, the vice president didn’t go out there Thursday and take a victory lap. She went out there and told people who she was, what she believed, where she stood on a number of key policy issues and what kind of president she would be. She talked about the threat of a second Trump presidency and she laid out the argument against him. She essentially said, “I’m a patriot. He is not. I will defend this country. He will not. I am like you. He is not like us.” During her speech, Harris looked like she was going to work. She looked like she could step off that stage and go straight into the situation room. That is the tone and tenor that Democrats need to carry over into these next couple of weeks because, between now and November, they’re going to have to fight for this victory.

The Supreme Court is a wild card on voting in the 2024 election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 1:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-2024-election-trump-arizona-rcna167954,"The Supreme Court didn’t give Republicans everything they wanted this week when it only partially granted their bid to enforce an Arizona law requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voting. The court rejected the emergency appeal to enforce state law to a degree that could have more clearly disenfranchised voters in the battleground state in this year’s presidential election. But even then, Republican-appointed Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch noted that they would have fully granted the request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republican officials. So, what does this mixed ruling portend for the seemingly inevitable legal fights to come in what may be a close election in November? It’s hard to know, exactly. That makes the high court a wild-card factor in the election, one in which Donald Trump’s possibly dimming prospects against an energized Democratic ticket could lead the GOP to lean on the courts even more heavily this year. Taking a closer look at the court’s order in the Arizona case, called RNC v. Mi Familia Vota, shows how the justices splintered in the appeal and how they may continue to divide going forward. The court didn’t explain itself, which isn’t entirely unusual for emergency appeals on the court’s so-called shadow docket. But the lack of expressed reasoning raises questions about what’s happening at the court and what’s to come. In addition to the order noting that Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch would have fully granted the GOP application, it further noted that Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have fully denied it. The votes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh aren’t listed on the order, putting them in the middle of the action. While it would have been good to know the reasoning underlying all the justices’ votes, it would have been especially worthwhile to see Roberts’ and Kavanaugh’s deciding rationale. Those two justices haven’t always sided with their fellow GOP appointees in voting cases, as shown by a surprise 5-4 ruling last year authored by Roberts and joined by Kavanaugh and the court’s three Democratic appointees. An issue underlying this Arizona litigation and voting cases generally is the degree to which courts can alter rules close to elections — what’s known as the “Purcell principle,” which is supposed to discourage changes close to elections to avoid confusion, but the Roberts Court has applied it inconsistently over the years. In the Arizona case, the two blocks of justices who noted their votes seemingly fall on different sides of the issue — though, again, neither block offered a written explanation. Perhaps more importantly, it’s unclear how Roberts or Kavanaugh arrived at their split decision, making it unclear how future voting appeals will be resolved as we head toward November, with three justices potentially prepared to go as far as Republicans want them to.

Jon Stewart’s DNC special showed exactly where his loyalty is,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-daily-show-dnc-episode-rcna167981,"Jon Stewart, who hosted “The Daily Show’s” wrap-up of the Democratic National Convention, had his work cut out for him Thursday night. To start, he had to follow the strong comedic acts that preceded him.   “I guess Donald Trump will finally know,” quipped a repentant D.L. Hughley during his address, “what it’s like when you get left for a younger woman.” That was pretty good! Not necessarily a “third-degree Ginsburn,” but a burn nonetheless.  Having Kerry Washington use two adorable small children (Vice President Kamala Harris’ grandnieces) to teach somewhat less adorable large Republican adults how to pronounce “Kamala” (i.e., Comma + La) was a masterstroke.  Stewart was also competing with the dextrous comedy duo of “Obama and Obama” that appeared the night before. The former president delivered a quip about “crowd sizes” accompanied by the type of deft physical gesture that stand-ups spend years learning how to execute. But when Michele Obama suggested Donald Trump might not even be aware that he’s actually applying for a “Black job,” well, my friends, that was a roast.  Stewart also had to deal with the technical unpredictability of covering a major live event. The production was less upended by circumstances than it was in July at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. As you might recall, the assassination attempt on Trump resulted in an extended security perimeter around the RNC, which in turn scuttled “The Daily Show’s” original on-site broadcasting plan.  Forced to abandon his Milwaukee theater at the last minute, Stewart ended up dialoguing with conservative firebrand Bill O’Reilly in New York. That disconcertingly amiable conversation led me to wonder if the host and his team had really thought through the complicated ethics of performing political comedy in dangerous times. Platforming people with anti-democratic ideas certainly has its risks, does it not?  Back to Thursday’s episode: What was Stewart, a liberal, supposed to make of the DNC’s glitzy, amped-up, eyeball-lacerating, celebrity-studded showcase? Because, let there be no doubt, that showcase was celebrating liberal values, not conservative ones and certainly not those of the far left.  There was plenty to lampoon, and it raises the question of how liberal comedians should best ply their craft. Are they partisans whose jokes must be pressed into the service of political ideology? Or, are they independent artists whose foremost responsibility is to make people laugh, ideology be damned?  This dilemma, I stress, is neither easily resolved nor even as black or white as I have framed it. In 2024 Stewart has been fairly consistent in going for the laugh at the expense of ideological conformity. That decision has, at points, incensed his critics. They argue — puritanically but not necessarily in error — that the present moment is too fraught for equal opportunity skewering. Train your fire, they exhort, on “them” not “us.”   On Thursday night, Stewart would have none of that. Still, he was measured in the way he placed his comedy in the service of jokes, not the party. That didn’t stop him, of course, from having some fun with the contradictions and erasures of today’s Democrats.  Billionaires, Stewart noted, were excoriated by Bernie Sanders. And then Chicago Gov. JB Pritzker rocked the mic (“our billionaire,” snarked Stewart).  Those who matriculate at elitist Yale University got called out by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Stewart, though, was quick to round up a raft (or heavyweight shell?) of Yalies who addressed the delegates. The Dems celebrated people who prosecuted sexual predators, and then Bill Clinton mounted the stage. Stewart wasn’t done. Palestinian Americans were nowhere to be seen or heard, but everyone else was. And, yes, there was so much pro-military chest thumping at the DNC that it was a wonder Democrats didn’t attempt a Blue Angel flyover within the United Center in Chicago. Stewart was mocking the party’s Liberal/Neo-Liberal divide, all the while suggesting it had thrown its leftist flank under the campaign bus. Half of Stewart’s liberal audience loved it. Half wished he’d shut his yapper. Half probably didn’t notice. And all were so hopped up on “joy” that they didn’t care either way. After all, what’s the alternative to Kamala? As an opening comic act, Obama and Obama served the party and comedy both. “The Daily Show,” on the other hand,  served comedy more than it served the party and the besieged liberalism it represents. In an age in which politicians act like comedians, and comedians act like journalists, Stewart’s choice seems reasonable to me. "
"As RFK Jr. ends his 2024 presidential campaign, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rfk-jr-ends-2024-presidential-campaign-happens-now-rcna168007,"For those wondering what to expect from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign, the writing has been on the wall for a while. The independent conspiracy theorist had already effectively stopped holding public events and raising money when his running mate signaled that the end of his candidacy was near. Nicole Shanahan said this week that their campaign faced a choice between continuing with its ill-fated effort — which would “risk” helping Vice President Kamala Harris, she said — or dropping out to “join forces” with Trump. The candid comments, made on a podcast, left little doubt that the Kennedy candidacy was intended to undermine the Democratic ticket. It also made clear that those expecting to see Kennedy’s 2024 candidacy persevere in the coming weeks and months needed to lower their expectations. Three days after Shanahan raised the prospect of pulling the plug on the doomed third-party campaign, the conspiracy theorist agreed to stand down. NBC News reported: Looking ahead, the obvious question is about the possible consequences. Kennedy obviously wasn’t going to win the presidential race or any electoral votes, but the anti-vaccine activist cultivated a modest following. As he exits the stage and throws his support behind Donald Trump, what happens now? On the surface, the Republican nominee has reason to be pleased. Even if Kennedy’s support had dwindled to a few percentage points, in a highly competitive race, a few percentage points is likely to make the difference between winning and losing. If recent polling puts Harris’ lead at around two points, Kennedy’s supporters could turn Trump’s deficit into an advantage. At least, that is, on the surface. Just below the surface it’s a bit more complicated. For one thing, some of Kennedy’s supporters might yet support the Democratic ticket, his Trump endorsement notwithstanding. For another, Kennedy’s base doesn’t appear to be made up of traditional voters. As a New York Times report, published before Kennedy’s announcement, explained, the independent’s backers “are less likely than others to have voted in 2020, and are also less likely to say they will vote come November.” In other words, with Kennedy out, his base is likely to splinter, and some of his fans will simply stay home in the fall. Complicating matters is that Democrats are going out of their way to tell the electorate that they’re the normal, responsible, and grown-up party in 2024, and voters should reject the fringe and the radical. It’s against that backdrop that Trump is picking up support from a fringe figure whose weird ideas made it impossible for his campaign to capitalize on months of voter dissatisfaction with Trump and President Joe Biden. Given recent events, the GOP nominee will celebrate good news where he can find it, and Trump is not in the habit of turning down endorsements from anyone. But if the former president and his allies are counting on a major boost as a result of Kennedy’s exit, they’re likely to be disappointed."
RFK Jr.'s journey from Democrat to Republican shows how Covid scrambled politics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-jr-drops-out-endorses-trump-president-election-2024-rcna167790,"Robert Kennedy Jr. announced on Friday that he has suspended his independent presidential campaign and will be endorsing former President Donald Trump. His move adds yet another twist in a presidential race filled with unexpected developments. It remains unclear how Kennedy’s withdrawal could affect the outcome of the election, and how much the move could reduce the number of voters who may have cast a ballot for him instead of Trump. More broadly, Kennedy’s maneuver is also a fascinating reflection of this ideologically topsy-turvy political era, when the Covid pandemic has scrambled American politics in unpredictable ways and turbocharged an epidemic of mistrust. Kennedy launched his campaign last year as a Democrat. On one level, that made perfect sense. Kennedy had been a lifelong member of the party, where his family remains political royalty. He worked for many years as a prominent environmental lawyer. And his presidential policy platform included some conventionally progressive ideas, such as support for unions. But on another level, it was an odd fit. Well before Covid derailed the world, Kennedy’s reputation as an environmental lawyer had been outstripped by his activism against vaccines. During the pandemic, the reach of that activism expanded dramatically. He became a superspreader of Covid-related misinformation online and his following grew specifically around that issue. Among other conspiracy theories, he claimed that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, were promoting vaccines for financial profit. Notoriously, he also argued that vaccine policies across the West were worse than Nazism. (He later sort of apologized.) Vaccine skeptics and opponents span the political spectrum, but they tend to skew conservative. It should be no surprise to hear, then, that Kennedy’s critiques of vaccine programs as totalitarian and Fauci as a tyrant resonated with plenty of people on the right. Even before he announced his campaign, his Covid-related activism influenced top Republicans’ views and messaging on vaccines. After Kennedy entered the presidential race, he was invited constantly onto high-profile right wing media platforms, even though he was running as a Democrat. And some libertarian tech moguls, skeptical of government regulation, took a liking to him. As I wrote at the time, this phenomenon could not be explained purely by a right-wing effort to boost a potential thorn in Biden’s side in the Democratic presidential primaries. It reflected that they and Kennedy were ideologically in line on issues ranging from public health to Ukraine policy to a general proclivity for conspiracy theories (including some racist ones): After failing to gain ground in the polls, Kennedy dropped out of the Democratic primaries in October. As he exited, Kennedy argued that the Democratic Party wasn’t giving him a fair shake and allowing him to debate Biden. But he also likely calculated that he could have a bigger effect on the race by entering the general election. After Kennedy went independent, polling on three-way matchups (Trump, Biden and Kennedy) initially indicated that he took a small bite out of the vote share for both candidates, and it was unclear who he’d hurt more. But over time, particularly after Biden stepped aside and Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as his successor, polling made it clear that Kennedy’s presence was a greater threat to Trump than the Democrats. That development indicates that, before Harris became the Democratic nominee, Kennedy had benefited from Biden’s weakness as a candidate. But the durability of Trump-friendly Kennedy voters also suggests that Kennedy has become a more substantive ideological competitor to Trump due to their overlapping worldviews. It makes sense, then, that Trump got into private deal-making talks with Kennedy and signaled that he’d welcome an endorsement. Kennedy’s political transformation illustrates how Covid and the government’s response to it really shook up some people’s worldview and served as a portal to new forms of political consciousness. Kennedy channeled that energy, first on the Democratic side of the aisle, and then as a free-floating independent, and now he’s using it to funnel people to the right. Kennedy’s views are deeply idiosyncratic and many of his perspectives aren’t an organic match for the MAGA right. But his most spirited — and salient — views now revolve around distrust in the medical establishment and government. Given what seems to matter to him most now, his new home makes more sense than the old one. "
Democrats' 'joyful' convention this week made a huge misstep by sidelining pro-Palestinian voices,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/dnc-gaza-kamala-harris-palestinian-uncommitted-rcna167950,"As Kamala Harris closed her acceptance speech on Thursday night to roaring applause and Beyoncé's ""Freedom"" blaring from the speakers and balloons falling from the ceiling, the elation on the arena floor could not be separated from the ways the Democratic Party engaged with its pro-Palestinian factions this week. The party had gone to lengths to silence and sideline those who spoke up about the administration's unconditional military aid to Israel and its hollow warnings about protecting civilian lives in the Gaza Strip. Delegates who unfurled a banner that said ""Stop Arming Israel"" were drowned out by chants of ""We love Joe"" and booted from the floor, The Associated Press reported. Other than a single panel on Palestinian human rights on Monday afternoon, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza received little attention. There was scant mention of the issue in speeches during the main programming, and when it came up, the horrors in Gaza were described in passive terms, as if Israel's military conduct and America's material support for it were unrelated. Harris herself spoke about the “heartbreaking” suffering in Gaza without mentioning who was responsible for the deliberate starvation of civilians, the bombings of refugee camps and schools and mosques, the fatal sniper shots to children’s heads and chests attested to by multiple doctors. The party also refused to grant the Uncommitted delegates' request for a Palestinian American to deliver remarks onstage, despite pressure from Democratic lawmakers and other outside groups. Members of the Uncommitted movement — a group within the party that aims to pressure Harris to endorse an arms embargo against Israel and a permanent cease-fire in Gaza — staged a sit-in from Wednesday evening, hoping until the eleventh hour that party leaders would change their minds. They did not. The exclusion of a Palestinian speaker from the main stage was not only a glaring political misstep, but also a moral one, and made it appear that Democrats hoped that sweeping the humanitarian crisis in Gaza under the rug would avoid putting a damper on their celebrations. (One immediate consequence was the announcement that the group Muslim Women for Harris was rescinding its support and disbanding.) This convention was an opportunity for Harris to walk the talk about Democrats as the party of inclusion and decency. It was also a chance for the party to show that supporters of Palestinian rights belonged under its big tent. In her speech on Thursday, Harris vowed to be a president “who leads and listens.” But when her party's pro-Palestinian bloc said loud and clear that they wanted a platform this week, Democrats failed them."
Why Bill Clinton’s amazing statistic about jobs and Democrats matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bill-clintons-amazing-statistic-jobs-democrats-matters-rcna167977,"When Bill Clinton spoke at the Democratic National Convention this week, he shared an economic claim that seemed implausible: In other words, over the last 35 years, employers have added roughly 51 million jobs in the United States, and 50 million of them — 98% — have been created during Democratic administrations. Is that true? Actually, yes. The claim comes with caveats (the former president didn’t have to start the clock in 1989, for example), but according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 51.5 million jobs have been added since January 1989 and roughly 1.3 million of them were created while a Republican president sat in the White House. How can that be? Well, there have been four recessions in the United States over the last 35 years: The first began in early 1990, during George H.W. Bush’s Republican administration; the second began in the spring of 2001, during George W. Bush’s Republican administration; the third (and most severe) began in late 2007, also during George W. Bush’s Republican administration; and the fourth began in the spring of 2020, during Donald Trump’s Republican administration. During that same time period, there have also been periods of rapid American job growth amid economic recoveries: Clinton’s second term, Barack Obama’s second term and Joe Biden’s first term. Given all of this and the dramatic job losses associated with the 2007 and 2020 recessions, it’s not too surprising that the Democrats-vs.-Republicans competition is lopsided. But why stop at the last 35 years? The Washington Post’s Philip Bump published a good analysis in the wake of Clinton’s convention speech and found: Longtime readers might recall that this has long been a point of curiosity for me. Marketwatch, for example, published a piece on the subject in 2015, noting that in the previous seven decades, economic growth, job growth and stock market performance have all been better under Democratic presidents. The Atlantic had a related report in 2017, adding that over the last 70 years, “the U.S. economy has been better, across many metrics, when a Democrat has been the president.” Writing for Slate way back in 2008, Michael Kinsley did some similar research. In case this isn’t obvious, since those reports were published, the results have become more favorable to Democrats, not less. It’s no wonder Clinton took the opportunity to brag. I am mindful of polls showing that many voters tend to see the Republican Party as more credible on the economy. I'm also aware of the evidence from recent history that shreds these misplaced assumptions."

Kamala Harris' DNC acceptance speech didn't overlook the Supreme Court's significance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 8:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kamala-harris-dnc-acceptance-speech-supreme-court-rcna167929,"Even if she only mentioned it a couple of times, the Supreme Court loomed large in Kamala Harris’ speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago on Thursday night. After all, she addressed two of the biggest rulings in recent years, both of which involve the Republican presidential nominee: the court’s broad grant of criminal immunity for presidents and its stripping of abortion rights.  On immunity, Harris cast the decision in Trump v. United States as the foundation for an even more dangerous second Trump term if he wins in November: “Consider the power he will have, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States.”  Harris’ general description of the ruling — “that he would be immune from criminal prosecution” — triggered some fact-checkers, who noted that the high court’s ruling is technically more complex than her summary. But while adding context about the ruling is theoretically helpful — that he’s absolutely immune for “core” constitutional acts, presumptively immune for all official acts but not immune for unofficial ones — the reality is that the extent of Trump’s immunity is yet to be determined.  The federal election interference case is now back in the trial court, where U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan will attempt to apply the new immunity test to Trump’s Washington, D.C., indictment in the first instance, after which the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority may have the last word on what its vague ruling means in practice. That is, unless Trump wins in November — in which case the prosecution is good as gone and we may never know how criminally immune the Roberts Court believes Trump to be. At any rate, Harris’ statement about Trump lacking guardrails thanks to the immunity ruling may turn out to be prescient if he’s re-elected. However vague the court’s ruling, it could provide Trump more of a roadmap for how to use the awesome power of the presidency to his personal advantage while minimizing criminal exposure. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in Trump v. United States didn’t meaningfully address Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s warning in dissent that presidents can now, for example, order Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival or organize a military coup to hold onto power with impunity.    The Democratic nominee also highlighted the high court’s wreckage on abortion: “But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear about how we got here: Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.” Indeed, Trump appointed three of the five justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022’s Dobbs decision.  Harris’ highlighting of both crucial rulings reminds us that the court is also on the ballot in November.

Former Trump spokesperson shares insight into how and why he lies,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 8:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-trump-spokesperson-shares-insight-lies-rcna167953,"In April 2020, Stephanie Grisham stepped down as Donald Trump’s White House press secretary. In August 2024, Grisham not only disavowed her former boss, she also spoke at the Democratic National Convention, telling attendees that the Republican nominee has “no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth.” But there was another part of her remarks that stood out for me. “[Trump] used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’ But it does matter — what you say matters, and what you don’t say matters.” At face value, the fact that Grisham was on the stage at all was extraordinary. Not only is Trump’s former vice president withholding his support for the Republican’s 2024 candidacy, and not only is Trump’s former White House chief of staff condemning his former boss, but Trump’s former White House press secretary and communications director appeared at the Democratic convention and explained how and why the Republican lies. But there was something familiar about what Grisham said during her remarks. As I noted in my new book, as Trump’s first year in the White House neared an end, Billy Bush wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times. Bush was not an especially notable public figure at the time, but in the infamous “Access Hollywood” record, he was the one Trump bragged to about assaulting women. (“When you’re a star, they let you do it,” the future president told Bush. “You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the p---y.”) In his 2017 op-ed, Bush reflected on what he’d learned about the then-president and shared an anecdote about a conversation he’d had with Trump about inflating the ratings of his reality-television program. Bush wrote that Trump had told him privately, “People will just believe you. You just tell them, and they believe you.” Seven years later, Grisham said something eerily similar: “[Trump] used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’” In other words, what Trump privately told Billy Bush about his willingness to lie is effectively identical to what Trump privately told his former White House press secretary about his willingness to lie. It’s a philosophy, for lack of a better word, rooted in the idea that fiction can simply overpower fact through relentless and shameless repetition. Why does the former president repeat transparent nonsense, over and over again? People close to him have already told us the answer."
Trump-owned club to host fundraiser for Jan. 6 rioters (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-owned-club-host-fundraiser-jan-6-rioters-rcna167937,"Discussion of the Jan. 6 attack did not dominate the Democratic National Convention this week, but the party certainly made an effort to remind the public about the assault on the U.S. Capitol and Donald Trump’s responsibility for the insurrectionist violence. In fact, on the third night of the DNC, attendees and viewers saw a four-minute video devoted specifically to Jan. 6. A day later, as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination, she declared, “[C]onsider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the U.S. Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite — he fanned the flames.” It was against this backdrop that The New York Times reported that a group supporting Jan. 6 criminals and defendants will soon hold a fundraising event for rioters at Trump’s golf club in New Jersey. I’m reasonably certain this news was first reported by the MeidasTouch Network. To be sure, the former president is listed on the announcement for the event as an “invited guest speaker,” though the Times’ report added that the GOP nominee does not plan to attend. The article nevertheless added, “Regardless of whether Mr. Trump will be present, it is an unusual — and potentially risky — move to permit a soiree supporting those who stormed the Capitol to be held at one of his most recognizable properties just as his presidential campaign goes full speed for its final few months.” That’s true, though it’s also worth emphasizing the familiarity of the circumstances. NBC News reported in June 2023, for example, that Trump spoke at a fundraiser on behalf of Jan. 6 criminals and defendants, held at his private golf club in Bedminster. “I’m going to make a contribution,” the former president said at the time. Two months later, NBC News ran a separate report, noting that Trump participated in a different fundraiser for Jan. 6 defendants, which was also held at his Bedminster golf club. These latest developments, in other words, are part of a pattern. The news also comes roughly three weeks after the Republican reiterated his intentions to issue pardons to convicted Jan. 6 felons — including those who assaulted police officers during the assault on the Capitol. The Associated Press reported in March that the former president has positioned “the violent siege and its failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House.” This coincided with a related Semafor report on the degree to which the Republican has put Jan. 6 rioters “at the heart of his campaign.” That was true then, and it appears to still be true now."
Trump suffers unintentionally funny meltdown on DNC’s final night,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-suffers-unintentionally-funny-meltdown-dncs-final-night-rcna167928,"If members of Donald Trump’s team had greater control of their boss, they probably should’ve tried to keep the former president distracted during the Democratic National Convention. The more the Republican’s attention could be diverted from television screens, the less likely he’d be to throw tantrums. But if that was the plan, it didn’t work. Before the final night of the DNC got underway, the former president announced that he’d offer online rebuttals to the convention by way of his social media platform. He certainly tried to do that, starting with a weird “WHERE’S HUNTER?” missive, as if Trump had briefly forgotten that there’s no longer any point in going after President Joe Biden’s son. As a New York Times report noted, the online tirades — totaling roughly 50 items — ultimately proved insufficient, prompting the GOP candidate to make a phone call. I can appreciate why the network worked quickly to get the Republican candidate on the air, albeit by telephone. Trump is, after all, the GOP nominee, and it stood to reason that he’d have something notable to say in response to his Democratic rival’s remarks.What Fox might not have realized, however, is that Harris’ convention speech had apparently caused a meltdown. Trump appeared on the air for about 10 minutes, during which time he not only raged incoherently, he also accidentally pushed random buttons on his phone. The interview — I’m using the word loosely — might’ve gone on longer, but Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum effectively cut off the former president mid-rant so that the network could move on to other programming. And while it was certainly amusing to see Fox effectively tell Trump they no longer wanted to hear him whine uncontrollably, it was even funnier when the Republican hung up with one conservative media network, only to call another.In fact, almost immediately after Trump ranted on Fox, he called Newsmax to keep the meltdown going a while longer. In a normal political party, such a meltdown would probably be seen as disqualifying. In the contemporary Republican Party, it was a tragically routine Thursday night."
"In convention speech, Kamala Harris succeeded where Trump failed",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 5:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/convention-speech-kamala-harris-succeeded-trump-failed-rcna167918,"On July 18, Donald Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention, where the former president was expected to deliver one of the most important speeches of his political career. He failed spectacularly: The GOP candidate spoke for more than an hour and a half, reminding voters of all the things they don’t like about him and failing to take advantage of a unique opportunity. Trump meandered aimlessly. He ad-libbed unnecessarily. He lied excessively. He was in equal measures divisive, bitter, juvenile, conspiratorial and alienating. The Republican nominee effectively presented a case study in how not to deliver an acceptance speech at a major party convention. Exactly six weeks later, Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Her remarks were not just a triumph on their own terms, they also succeeded where her Republican rival failed. NBC News reported: Why did her convention speech work? Harris presented herself as the change candidate: That’s not an easy thing for an incumbent vice president to pull off, but the Democrat’s “new way forward” rhetoric resonated in part because she’s running against a failed GOP candidate who’s led his party’s ticket in every election since 2016. Worse, Trump is explicitly running on a platform of taking the nation backwards, while Harris repeatedly used the word ""forward"" in her remarks. Harris reached out to a broad electorate: Six weeks after Trump’s needlessly divisive remarks, the Democratic nominee declared, “I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self.” In the same remarks, she added, “Our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past — a chance to chart a new way forward — not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” Harris was optimistic and patriotic: “[O]ur opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is,” the vice president said. “Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: Freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities. We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.” Harris sounded like a normal human being: While Trump raged on his social media platform, the Democratic nominee assured voters, “I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense.” Harris was disciplined — and didn’t go on and on: Trump’s 90-minute rant in Milwaukee sent some of his loyalists heading for the exits before it was over. The vice president’s remarks, in contrast, were half as long. The former abandoned his script to share strange thoughts that popped into his mind; the latter recognized the importance of being a disciplined candidate for the nation’s highest office. I won’t pretend to know what’s going to happen on Election Day 2024, but as the dust settles in Chicago, Harris has reason to feel good about her chances."
The GOP’s racist attacks on Kamala Harris reveal a painful paradox for people like me,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-black-indian-race-trump-rcna167777,"In her rousing Democratic National Convention address Thursday night, Vice President Kamala Harris paid homage to her mother's determination, “traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream.” I, like Harris, am a mixed-race South Asian. My father is Pakistani and my mother is Caucasian (mostly British, though born and raised in Southern Africa). And the tired racialized narratives about Harris’ identity are familiar, echoing narratives and projections about my own identity that I’ve navigated throughout my life. The untidiness of mixed-race identities and the discomfort that produces foregrounds our collective preoccupation with categorizing and ordering people, an often dehumanizing process — not to mention, a stubborn relic of the colonial episteme.  According to her detractors, Harris is either “too Black” or “too Indian” or not enough of either. In the words of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, she “is a fundamentally fake person.” “I believe that Kamala Harris is whatever she says she is,” Vance said in an interview with CNN earlier this month. “She pretends to be one thing in front of one audience. She pretends to be something different in front of another audience.” “Is Kamala a chameleon? Is she Indian?” cried former wrestling star and MAGA fanboy Hulk Hogan in a video obtained by TMZ. He followed this with a racist, so-called Native American greeting. (Hulk, are you OK?)  More than anything, these examples evince to me just how unstable racial categories are. Mixed-race folx are often reduced to a binaristic paradigm — they are either too much of one thing or not enough of either. Or, paradoxically, they are both at the same time.  Throughout my life, I have been told I am not white enough. I am not brown enough. Or I am too brown. Though, interestingly, never too white. The one-drop rule, a Jim Crow-era law which stipulated that even one drop of blood from a Black ancestor made someone Black (as though it is a contamination), seems alive and well in how we collectively define mixed-race people today — especially if you present as anything other than white. (Colorism is an entirely different dimension of this.) And these narratives insist we are “whole of nothing.” It’s important to note that Harris’ lived experience is different in a multitude of ways, not least because she is competing with being two different kinds of minorities, contending with the heavy burden of historical racism around Blackness in this country and the suspicion of being an Indian foreigner. Suffice it to say, conversations around mixed-race identity are infused with covert white supremacy. One way I encounter it, for example, is in the refusal to accept mixed-race people, who are partially white, as white.  I’ve been told by white people that I profit off of being brown (the “DEI accusation” levied by white people who feel that minorities can bypass meritocracy, which is itself a fallacy). It’s as though the world — built on tenuous, stratifying racial paradigms — cannot handle the embodiment of identities that destabilize these paradigms. We saw this discomfort play out a few weeks ago when Trump questioned whether Harris was “Black enough.”  “She was only promoting Indian heritage,” Trump said in an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “Is she Indian or is she Black?” That preposterous question perfectly captures the discomfort produced in many by the existence of mixed-race people, who embody experiences and/or identities that challenge our racial ordering.   My experience as a mixed-race person makes me reflect on racial formation theory, a framework introduced by sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant in the 1980s, which postulates “that ‘race’ is a social and political reality that remains unfixed, due to the role of institutions and groups in shaping its meaning,” sociologist Eileen O’Brien explains in “The Cambridge Handbook of Sociology.” Mixed-race people both highlight the instability of racial categories and further destabilize these ideologies. However, it’s worth noting that, like most things that emerged in the ‘80s, we should take this with a grain of salt. For example, detractors, such as sociologists Joe Feagin and Sean Elias, argue that the theory doesn’t do enough to decenter whiteness. “[R]acial formation theory inadequately explains: racial meanings and white racial framing; US society’s racial foundation; the US state and other sites of racial contestation; whites’ and white elites’ centrality in contemporary racism; challenges to a racially pluralistic democracy; and group resistance to racism, especially that of the black ‘radical’ intellectual tradition,” they write in “Rethinking Racial Formation Theory: A Systemic Racism Critique.” Nonetheless, Omi and Winant’s contributions were critical in exposing the instability and sophism of racial categories, which, of course, continue to haunt us to this day. I don’t find the current mainstream discourse around Harris (and other mixed-race folx) useful — applying racial litmus tests and debating to what extent she and others like her qualify for certain groups and identities. But I do find conversations about my identity as a mixed-race person useful when it’s self-reflexive and when they help situate me in terms of intersectionality. For example, I’m interested in discussing how being half-white provided me with the cultural capital that helped me be admitted into and navigate the elite institutions I’ve attended for my undergraduate and graduate studies, even as I’m read as brown. Being half-white has afforded me extraordinary privileges. But/and how much was my drive to attend such institutions born from a compensatory and perfectionist part, burdened by my own experiences with racism, that believes I am less-than because I am brown and that I must excel in order to be worthy?  My brother and I had many of the same socioeconomic privileges as my white cousins, for example, which my brown cousins have not had. Conversely, we were unable to visit South Africa, where my mother was primarily raised, and meet my family there until after 1994, because of apartheid and the enforced segregation. My white cousins were able to make that trip years before my brother and I were. The point is, it’s messy and complex and nuanced.  These are the kinds of mainstream conversations that I believe we should be having about Harris’ identity, through the prism of intersectionality — conversations that allow us to interrogate shifting power dynamics and the instability of racial categories. This, I believe, would serve us all well. But questioning whether Harris is Black enough or Indian enough is not in service of anything — except white supremacy."
This photo of Gus Walz was a teachable moment. Republicans missed it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-son-gus-dnc-crying-rcna167870,"This week’s Democratic National Convention has breathed life and hope into this current election cycle and taught lessons that have left so many of us newly energized for the months and years ahead. But no one could have imagined that a 17-year-old boy, with an unbridled display of pride for his father, would show the nation precisely what it looks like when a child has been raised with a healthy model of masculinity. As Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz highlighted his family’s struggles with infertility during his speech accepting the Democratic nomination for vice president, his son, Gus, stole the show. Gus, through tears and cheers, gave his father a standing ovation and pointed toward the stage while yelling, “That’s my dad!” Predictably, social media lapped it up. My own heart melted as I read those posts. However, there’s unfortunately another side to social media — another side to society overall. It’s the one that pathologizes boys and men who dare to express tender emotions. Indeed, people on this side came out in droves to belittle the special moment Gus publicly shared with his dad. Conservative media pundit Ann Coulter weighed in on the exchange in an ill-advised attempt to lob back a description that Democrats have effectively affixed to today’s Republicans. I’m sad for Coulter and others who’ve come out of the woodwork to mock Gus expressing love for his father. One is forced to assume that Coulter, and those like her who made remarks too awful to mention, are unfamiliar with the deep, unbridled love and joy that was on display between father and son. Jealousy, they say, breeds contempt. The exchange between Walz and his son is meaningful for reasons bigger than them and bigger than politics. When I was a public school teacher, I was surrounded by boys who were socially conditioned to use profanity and their fists to express emotion. I saw first-hand how the behavioral issues that emerged in my classroom and school were a product of boys who were not allowed to feel the full range of emotions available to human beings. They certainly were not allowed to feel tender, more vulnerable emotions publicly. Profanity and fists took precedence over tears, hugs and even kindness, almost every time. Remarkably, such belligerent displays also took precedence over joy. Every teacher probably has a story about seeing a boy who chose aggression to display happiness. I remember seeing a boy shove another boy into a wall when the principal announced a snowstorm was coming and school was closing early. To be clear, the boy doing the shoving was happy at the news. As a career educator, I continue to witness boys conditioned to display a toxic, aggressive version of masculinity. It’s the kind exemplified by the sort of brazen selfishness, cruelty and misogyny that was amplified during Donald Trump’s term as president.  The only appropriate response to adult men who know of no other way to be men is pity. Sadly, many boys today behave no differently from the way boys behaved when I was a child in the 1980s and '90s. Crying remains verboten, even if, we’re hearing the worst of the internet say, those tears accompany giving one’s own father a deeply emotional display of love and joy.   In a brief amount of time, Walz has offered us a clear alternative to the subpar, and I dare say pathetic, “masculine” identities that have historically been available to boys and men. Walz shows us that men can be hunters, fishermen and football coaches while also championing reproductive rights and advocating for the humanity of LGBTQ folks. A man can be a decorated veteran and legislate for free feminine products in schools. A man can fix a car and teach his son that there exists a joy and pride so deep that the only thing a boy can do is clap and cry. Walz and his wife, Gwen, raised a joyful son. The result of their raising him that way is a young man who knows that healthy boys aren’t afraid to cry and they’re not afraid to show love. There’s a lot at stake in this election — perhaps more at stake than any other election in American history. I might be naive, but I wonder if Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz, and the examples set by their families, have the power to change how we think about boys and men. I hope that their efforts create more joyful opportunities to usher in conversations about a new, healthier and sustainable masculinity."
The Democratic and Republican conventions told very different stories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democratic-republican-conventions-differences-rcna167651,"The Democratic and Republican national conventions this year may as well have been for different countries. Although the two parties typically have different messaging and contrasting overall vibes during their conventions, their dramatically different approaches this year laid bare the canyon-sized divide between them. The Democratic National Convention, which concluded Thursday night, exuded vitality, optimism and competence. The Republican National Convention in July leaned on fear, anger and falsehoods. “We have so much more in common than what separates us that none of us, none of us, has to fail for all of us to succeed,” declared official Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Her aspirational, 37-minute address was a strong contrast to Republican nominee Donald Trump's 93-minute acceptance speech, which was full of self-pity, meandering asides and references only his die-hard fans would understand. Another glaring gap was the energy in the room. On Tuesday, the Democrats turned the usually dull roll call into a chance to celebrate the diversity of each state and territory with handpicked songs and surprises like rapper Lil Jon representing Georgia, turning a mundane bit of housekeeping into a full-blown house party. Compare that to the Republican National Committee’s lugubrious roll call last month. It kicked off with House Speaker Mike Johnson reminding delegates to remain orderly, before the convention’s secretary proceeded to slog through over an hour of votes that made Trump’s nomination feel mundane to the point of somber, even bleak. The parade of mostly white men casting their delegates’ votes for Trump reflected the homogeneity of the MAGA party, and was at odds with the diversity that makes America strong. Then there’s the competence, and lack thereof, on display at the two events. I know from experience as a former Republican National Committee chairman that a convention needs to be tightly choreographed to project a party competent enough to lead America into the future. The Republican convention’s first night got off to a slow start when Johnson abruptly left the stage after a teleprompter malfunction heavily delayed the proceedings, leaving the cover band Sixwire to entertain the audience amid the technical difficulties. Meanwhile, showrunners of the Democratic convention were able to perfectly time the roll call’s conclusion to the moment Harris took the stage at a campaign rally in Milwaukee 80 miles away, allowing her to seamlessly address both audiences at once. But the differences ran deeper than that. Consider the vision each party presented of what a prosperous America looks like. The crowd at the Republican convention was punctuated by a sea of signs reading “MASS DEPORTATION NOW,” while Democratic signs praised American workers and unions. Republican convention speakers painted their Democratic neighbors as “a clear and present danger to America,” while the Democratic convention platformed Republicans like Ana Navarro and even a former Trump White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. These speakers highlighted how issues that affect one group affect us all. They presented an America befitting of its original national motto, e pluribus unum: “Out of many, one” — while the MAGA party continued to promote a false patriotism that paints neighbors as enemies and prosperity as a zero-sum game. But the most obvious difference is also the defining one: the difference between the two candidates each party has embraced as its nominee. While Harris presented the America her mother immigrated to with a dream of curing cancer, Trump expressed a longing to usher in “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.” Harris acknowledged the importance of putting country over party, while Donald stoked more division. Harris vowed that “between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs.” Trump promoted more lies about the 2020 election. Despite the pomp and circumstance of a party convention, it’s this difference that’s the most urgent, because it’s the choice the American people will face in November. It’s the election that will decide whether our better natures win over dangerous paranoia. It’s the choice that will determine whether the rally cry of “We’re not going back” defines America’s future or is just another catchy campaign slogan.

Kamala Harris wasn’t taking any chances in her DNC speech — but that’s why it worked,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 10:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-acceptance-speech-dnc-democratic-convention-rcna167674,"The 2024 Democratic National Convention is over, and despite fears of intraparty fighting and violent clashes between police and protesters outside the United Center — this was not a replay of 1968. In fact, Lil Jon’s roll call cameo notwithstanding, it was about as basic as political conventions get. And that’s probably the best Democrats could hope for.  The crowd in Chicago’s United Center roared as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for president. It’s a historic moment and one that clearly inspired a lot of emotion. The cameras found more than a few non-dry eyes in the house.  But like the convention itself, Harris’ speech was successful in large part because she played it kind of safe.  She wished her husband, “Dougie” Emhoff, a happy 10th anniversary. She told a compelling personal story about being a child of immigrants who traveled the world to work for the American dream — and succeeded. And she spoke about her distinguished career as a prosecutor who always showed up “for the people.” Then there was the Donald Trump part of the speech. Here, Harris hit the necessary notes — reminding voters that Trump “tried to throw away your votes” during his monthslong attempt to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. And, oh yeah, that he’s been convicted of felonies and found liable for sexual abuse. (I know we’re almost a decade into the Trump era, but it still blows my mind how these brief nuggets of his recent bio are seen as little more than campaign talking points by much of the American electorate.) Harris also highlighted arguably Trump’s most important political victory — getting three justices onto the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Harris spoke of the consequences of Trump’s legacy, including “women miscarrying in a parking lot, getting sepsis, losing their ability to ever have children again, all because doctors are afraid of going to jail for caring for their patients.” And, in a callback to one of the most affecting segments of the DNC, Harris spoke of “children who have survived sexual assault, potentially forced to carry the pregnancy to term. This is what is happening in our country. Because of Donald Trump.”  Harris’ rhetorical assaults on Trump were absolutely the high point of the speech. She articulated the verifiable threats Trump poses to democracy, the global order and the rights of everyday Americans in succinct, pugnacious fashion.  When it came to policy specifics, it didn’t sound like much of a departure from Joe Biden’s agenda. There was lots of talk about “the middle class” and Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires.  But Harris was completely vague about building what she called an “opportunity economy” that, under her leadership, would bring together “labor and workers, small-business owners and entrepreneurs, and American companies.” How she’d bring together these often competing forces — and what “bringing together” even means — remains unexplained.  And on an evening dubbed by some social media smart alecks as “normie night” — the one night when less partisan people would likely be tuned in — the program was stuffed with police officers, ex-Republicans, moderates and foreign policy tough talk.  In this vein, Harris assured the normies that, unlike Trump, she would not abandon NATO and that “as commander in chief I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Republicans have for decades portrayed Democrats as lacking the killer instinct to deal with the worst actors on the international stage. This was Harris’ moment to let the undecideds know that she understands the threats posed by Iran and China, while adding that she wouldn’t be reckless and impulsive with that power — like Trump. Then came the Gaza part of the speech. The lack of a Palestinian American speaker or any representative from the Uncommitted delegation was the elephant in the room, and after a staunch defense of Israel’s right to defend itself and a condemnation of the terrorist organization Hamas, Harris spoke of the civilian suffering in Gaza. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” Again, when getting specific, it didn’t appear that Harris’ policy is any different from Biden’s: “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity. Security. Freedom. And self-determination.”  Team Harris is most likely hoping that her stated commitments to work for a cease-fire and a Palestinian state — especially given the fact that her opponent openly uses the word “Palestinian” as an insult — will be enough to temporarily quell the dissatisfaction from the party’s progressive wing and get it out to vote in November. We will, fairly soon, find out. Over the course of four often long nights, Harris and Democrats made history this week. Along the way, America heard from Oprah, America’s new favorite high school football coach, Tim Walz, and the party’s rising stars, like Govs. Wes Moore and Josh Shapiro. But with Nov. 5 just 74 days away, there is very little room for error. And if the convention and Harris’ acceptance speech are indications, Democrats know full well they cannot afford to make any mistakes between now and the election."
Highlights and analysis of Kamala Harris’ speech on the final day of the 2024 DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 9:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/kamala-harris-speech-dnc-live-updates-rcna165595,"This was a DNC that actually felt worth watching, one that put some of the rising luminaries to the forefront and jazzed up even some of the most cynical people I know. It’s something that would have been hard to imagine just a month ago, but the energy and momentum is there. Now that we’re finally past both conventions, it’s up to the Harris campaign to continue working to capture this lightning and channel all that energy into getting voters to the ballot box in November. Jacob Soboroff speaking on MSNBC moments ago: This felt like a convention about neighbors, friends and family, whereas — and this is no secret, I’ve said it many times before — the Republican Convention was straight-up deeply disturbing.  There was one moment at that convention that made that crystal clear and that was thousands of people holding up signs that said ""mass deportations now."" The Republican Party’s platform literally consists of removing over 10 million people from the United States of America, many of whom are our neighbors, our friends and our families.  Both conventions talked about neighbors, friends and family. The Republicans said we want to remove millions of them from this country in a deportation effort with a magnitude bigger than the 1954 operation run by Dwight D. Eisenhower, with the name so racist and so offensive I don’t think it’s appropriate to say on television. The Republicans were proud of that. At the end of that convention, I remember standing in front of the stage with balloons bouncing off my head and it just felt bizarre, like we were in a bizarro world where they were having a party while we talked about kicking out people who are the fabric of the United States of America.  Here you looked at the stage and that looked like a family. That’s the fabric of the United States of America. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: This was joyful. It was full of love. People watching were like, where has that amazing person been for the last couple of years? That's a lot of what I’m getting in text messages from right now. But it's also the biggest moment to remind the American public that this is ultimately still an election where Kamala Harris is running against Donald Trump.  That’s part of why there's this big coalition of current Republicans, former Republicans, sheriffs, people who don’t normally come to these things because this election is not the norm. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. One line that stands out in re-reading the speech captures a key difference between Harris’ vision of America and Trump’s. Telling the story of how her single mother relied on neighbors and friends to help raise her and her sister, Harris said these aunts and uncles were “none of them, family by blood, and all of them, family by love.” Trump has also referenced “blood,” notably saying in December that undocumented immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” a line that uncomfortably echoed the “blood and soil” rhetoric of white supremacists. Harris has also represented her vision through her own family, which includes two stepchildren, and her calls for the protection of the rights of of LGBTQ families. Symone Sanders-Townsend speaking on MSNBC moments ago: For this current Republican party apparatus, the culture wars are not just a distraction: they are the playbook. Donald Trump and JD Vance would love nothing more than for Vice President Harris to stand on that stage and say, elect me because you will make history.  She’s not saying that. She’s saying elect me for all of these other reasons. Elect me because I’m decent, because I’ll fight for you, because I know what needs to be done and because I respect America. She’s essentially saying, elect me because I am a patriot and the other guy is not. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Ari Melber speaking on MSNBC moments ago: For years, we’ve known her as the vice president but tonight, America got to meet Harris for the role she’s played most of her career: representing the people.  It was a home run of a speech. What we heard was her give the opening statement: here’s who I am, here’s where I come from and these are my values. Then she made the case against Donald Trump and she made it more directly and more bluntly than we’ve heard throughout this inclusive and joyous convention. She needed to do that because that’s what candidates do.  So for all the joy, she hit him hard legally — she spoke about Jan. 6, democracy and fraud. She also made a point to say something that’s legally true, that Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse. That is something that fewer people have said from the main stage — that, again, is the Kamala Harris we know from being the tough prosecutor. Then third, we got the closing argument, broadening back out to the message: we can do this together, I'm proud to be American, we’re not going back. In each of those chapters, we got what you would get from her in the courtroom — and she’s good at it. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Harris demonstrated some elite storytelling ability tonight. It felt like the nation was becoming more acquainted with her as she told stories of her parents’ background and her upbringing. And when it comes to the sheer politics, she showed she’s very skilled at weaving her personal background into discussions about voter issues. Whether she was discussing her mom’s experience as a health professional, how her parents’ reverence for the civil rights movement prepped her for a legal career, or the pride her family and their neighbors had in homeownership, she told a relatable story about the positive role that the government has played in her family and the good things it can do for others. It’s a markedly different approach than Trump and the GOP are taking — and with much better delivery, too. Harris has gotten a lot better at giving speeches. As a former prosecutor, she was always good when cross-examining a witness in a Senate hearing, but her big set-piece speeches weren’t as good. Whether it’s practice from her time as vice president or having better speechwriters, she did a solid job at the podium tonight. The one thing that stuck out to me was the dissonance between the joyousness at the convention and the Democratic Party’s treatment of its pro-Palestinian factions. Party leaders snubbed the Uncommitted movement and the delegates who spoke up about their demand for an arms embargo against Israel were booted from the floor. How the party dealt with their own this week spoke volumes, and it certainly won’t go unnoticed among undecided voters for whom Gaza is a major issue. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Just to draw a contrast, tonight, what was Donald Trump doing? He was posting on media things like “where’s Hunter?” and “no, Tim Walz wasn’t coach, he was assistant coach.” And that’s funny, but it’s also not. It’s actually pretty devastating. So people will of course ask, was Harris' speech perfect? But look at what she’s running against. It's darkness and fear vs. optimism and light. And that’s what she offered tonight, not just optimism and light but real policy and a vision for the country. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We’ve talked a lot over the course last couple of days about how Democrats are trying to reclaim patriotism. I feel like it culminated in this night.  There are these gigantic flags. There’s The Chicks singing the Star Spangled Banner.  There’s the thesis that came into full flower tonight with Kamala Harris making the argument that the true strength, the true integrity, the true patriotism, lies in the Democratic Party. They have opened the flaps of the tent to encompass Republicans, to encompass doubters, to encompass people who felt culturally divorced from the party for decades and here we have one of the broadest, deepest, most diverse coalitions I have ever seen. All of them marching under the stars and stripes. It’s really something else. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Women were so present in this convention, in a way they were absent in the Republican National Convention because they were trying to avoid the whole abortion conversation.  But it isn’t just on reproductive rights, it was the idea of mom, of mommy, of motherliness that's been woven throughout this convention. Whether it was Michelle Obama talking about losing her mom or the many women talking about having the choice on how to create families. The way they’ve described family and mothers has been very unique and interesting. As well as the way they’ve defined manhood and masculinity. I still can’t get over Tim Walz's son, I think that is still sticking with so many people. It’s a really modern sort of conception of the family.  Between that moment and this night of hearing Kamala Harris and her sister Maya talk about their mom, I definitely feel like this was an embrace of motherhood by choice, whether it's a stepmom or a blended family. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump ran a one-man live blog tonight, firing off more than 40 posts (yes, I counted) on Truth Social, starting from the moment she walked onstage. He criticized her on immigration, on reproductive rights — “I TRUST WOMEN, ALSO, AND I WILL KEEP WOMEN SAFE!“ — on the economy, and much more. “IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” he asked at one point. Well, yes. After the balloon drop, the convention ended with a benediction from two speakers who hit on the Harris campaign theme of freedom. Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt of Washington D.C.’s Adas Israel Congregation, began with a reference to the book of Exodus, saying “God brought us out of the narrow place of oppression to freedom.” Lawrence O'Donnell speaking on MSNBC moments ago: My experience listening to Kamala Harris began when tonight’s host of the convention, Kerry Washington, asked me “Would you like to meet the female Obama?” This was in 2009, in the first months of the Obama presidency. And so we went along with Reggie Hudlin, who coincidentally produced some of the films in this convention, to listen to the San Francisco district attorney. And it’s one of those moments that’s clearly once in a lifetime. I was sitting there realizing I am seeing the first Black woman president, no question about it. ""Star power"" is a Hollywood phrase, but it’s a real thing. Every once in a while there is someone who yes, has all the resume stuff, but then there’s this other thing. And it’s that star power. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Harris’ speech wrapped up after about 40 minutes, less than half the amount of time it took Trump to deliver his speech, which lasted more than 92 minutes and made for the longest convention acceptance speech in history. It may seem trivial, but I continue to believe that this difference between Trump — who has been known to deliver some exhaustingly long speeches — and Harris speaks to a respect that the Democrat has for her audience that Republican seems to lack. She delivers speeches that are fairly short and to the point, as if she and her supporters have places to be. Trump drones on with speeches — sometimes for hours at a time — like he knows his fans have an endless amount of time to give him, or like nobody has anything else better to do. Nicolle Wallace speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I think there was some incorrect analysis out there that Harris somehow had to pass the commander-in-chief test. But what she did tonight was disqualify Donald Trump from ever being the country’s commander-in-chief. She said, “Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important election in our lives, it’s the most important in the life of our nation.” You take her speech and you take some of these lines from former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, who said that every president since World War II, Republican and Democrat, shared the belief that America must protect democracy in the world. Every president has honored our veterans and their sacrifices. Every president but one. You add Adam Kinzinger and Congressman Ruben Gallego and their indictments of Trump’s disrespect and disregard for members of the military, especially those who have been injured or died in service to the country, they were scathing. Those indictments were elevated on the biggest stage in American politics and I think they closed the door in the minds of anyone watching on Donald Trump ever passing the commander-in-chief test again. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Voters who had hoped that Harris would strike a different tone on Gaza likely came away disappointed tonight. The vice president said she and Biden are “working around the clock” for a hostage deal and a ceasefire. She affirmed her support for Israel’s right to defend itself and said she will always ensure its ability to do so. She condemned Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks and the “unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people” at the Nova music festival. But on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Harris adopted more passive language. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating,” she said, declining to specifically call out Israel’s role in the suffering and death. “So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again.”  This portion of this speech will also not placate the “Uncommitted” movement, which had slammed Harris and the DNC more broadly for failing to feature any Palestinian American speakers this week. Harris’ failure to draw a meaningful distinction between her and Biden’s view on the issue tonight will certainly be noted. As you may have noticed, there was not a special appearance from Mrs. Beyonce Knowles-Carter tonight. Dozens of attendees who wore “Cowboy Kamala” fits tonight for nothing are likely devastated at the lack of an appearance from the superstar. This despite TMZ promising us that she would be performing, as did several dozen random people on social media who insisted that she was there in Chicago. Look, I don’t know who started this rumor. Maybe it was a bored convention staffer whose deadpan is a little too dry to have their sarcasm register. Maybe it was James Taylor in revenge for having his number cut on Night 1 of the DNC. Maybe it was some evil genius on the Harris team who figured out a way to get people to tune in who might not otherwise watch and stay until the balloons have dropped.  In the end, we are all the more deceived for tonight’s ruse. But, if you really think about it, what is a recording of Beyonce’s “Freedom,” the campaign’s anthem that played at the close of Harris’ speech, if not a “performance?” Given her accelerated campaign launch, Harris has not released as many detailed proposals on what she would do as president as normal. She also has benefited both from Trump’s similarly thin agenda and the conservative Project 2025 proposal, which goes into excessive detail on a number of proposals that poll terribly. So I listened intently to her acceptance speech for hints of what she might do as president. Here are the specific promises: • Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act • Pass the Freedom to Vote Act • Pass the bipartisan border security bill that was scuttled earlier this year • Pass a middle-class tax cut that would help more than 100 million Americans • Work for a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza Others were more like broad goals than proposals, including lowering the cost of “everyday needs”; providing access to capital for small-business owners; building a strong middle class; ending the housing shortage; stopping cuts to Social Security and Medicare; ensuring that America leads in space and artificial intelligence; and creating an “earned pathway to citizenship” for undocumented immigrants. While everyone wonders how in the world this Beyoncé performance rumor took hold so deeply, why not read these fun balloon drop facts? “With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act,” Harris said. Well, that’s true but it’s going to take another Democratic trifecta in Washington next year to do it. Moreover, it’s going to take her fully supporting the Senate reforming (or, better yet, killing) the filibuster to do so. Harris and other Democrats have hit Trump hard the last few nights over his decision to kill a bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate negotiated. “Here is my pledge to you: As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed. And I will sign it into law,” Harris said. “We can create an earned pathway to citizenship —  and secure our border.” Yeah, I’m sorry but … the immigration bill is bad. Like, I get that there was, and is, a real desire to stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum across the border. But the bill that was negotiated focused entirely on the “border security” side of the equation and dropped the citizenship side entirely. In doing so, it didn’t just continue the failed immigration politics of the last 20 years, it made them worse. Harris just went on an extended riff on one of her favorite campaign themes: freedom. Borrowing a bit of rhetoric long used by Republicans (remember “freedom fries”?), Harris has sought to recast Democratic priorities as issues of freedom, including gun control, LGBTQ rights, climate change and voting rights. In her speech, she said: I’ve written more about her use of “freedom” — including the Beyoncé campaign song — here. Harris drew a distinct contrast between Democrats and Republicans — read: Trump — on reproductive rights. She also vowed to sign legislation to restore reproductive freedom at the federal level.   “Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom and now he brags about it,” she said. “And one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don’t trust women? Well, we trust women.” The entire week has built to this moment. We have heard from so many people who have known Harris throughout her life, and their words and anecdotes have contextualized and added depth and humanity to her profile. However, nothing is more important than the vice president telling her own story in her own words. This is the largest audience Harris may have this election, and it was critical to start tonight talking about her family, where she is from and what shaped her. She did that. But she did more than that. The VP’s story has pieces that everyone can identify with — moving around a lot as a child, watching her parents split up when she and her sister were young, growing up in a middle class community, living as the daughter of immigrants. Lots of people can literally see themselves in the journey of her life. When she accepted the nomination on behalf of all of those various communities and individuals, she elevated the conversation. The start of her speech made something big very clear: tonight is about all of America. Biden would often refuse to give Trump the dignity of using his name when referring to him in speeches. “The other guy” or “the former guy” littered his speeches. Harris on the other hand is leaning into calling out Trump directly. She also called out the threat he would entail should he return to power, without taking the dark tone that her boss has used when making similar warnings. I loved that line Harris delivered connecting her parents’ reverence for civil rights figures with her choice to become a lawyer. ""My parents had met at a civil rights gathering, and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker-Motley — those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America.” Over on The ReidOut Blog, I’ve written over the past couple years about Donald Trump and the conservative movement’s attacks on Black lawyers — like Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Harris is on that list as well. And her reference to the esteemed Black lawyers who came before her is a reminder of the conservative movement’s assault on Black civic and civil participation.  It’s been nearly a decade since Trump rode his golden escalator into American political life, and Harris is betting that people are ready to move on. Even though she’s served in the current administration for the last four years, the first thing that Harris said after accepting the nomination was that she was ready to turn the page. “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward,” she said. “Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” That’s the kind of line that you give at the end of a two-term presidency from the opposing party, not from a sitting vice president. But Trump has never really left, and Harris thinks Americans are ready to be done with him. I wrote earlier tonight about how this DNC has been a celebration of being a Democrat. The convention then proceeded to give prime speaking slots to a Republican, a cop and former military officials who could tout Harris as the next commander-in-chief. I saw plenty of complaints about this online, but it does make sense to me when you consider who the audience has been over the course of the last week. It’s been the diehard nerds like me and you fine folks reading this live blog who’ve been watching since the first night. Contrast that with the people who are less tuned in, likely more moderate, and are considering whether to vote for Harris and only taking a look tonight. If the idea is to invite those who are still considering voting for Trump, or might stay home if Harris is too liberal for them, to back Harris, then I get why they wanted to load up tonight with the most moderate to conservative elements backing her. Do I agree with this strategy? It’s hard to say. I get the logic, but I think there’s something to be said for pushing hard on the ways that Democrats are the party that will help them out the most on the night that the most eyeballs are watching live. This race is going to come down to turnout, getting people to show up to the polls or fill out their mail ballots. Trump has given up on that concept in favor of warning about nonexistent mass electoral fraud. Democrats are banking on convincing some of those who consider themselves independents, who are honestly more likely conservative, who are disillusioned with Trump to come out and support Harris instead. I’d prefer, though, if that didn’t come with frustrating those who spent the last several nights feeling a sense of pride in being a Democrat that had been lacking not just a few months ago, but over the last few decades. The bio section of the speech more than checked the box. It was a skillful effort of telling her own individual story while also making it about others and allowing people to connect with her personally. Harris stood in front of thousands and thousands of Democrats and delivered the lines they had all been waiting for this week: “On behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be President of The United States of America.” Harris told the story of her friend Wanda Kagan, who confided in Harris that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather in high school. “And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us. And she did,” Harris said. “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor — to protect people like Wanda.” A Montreal native, Kagan met Harris when the vice president lived in Canada during her teenage years. Kagan told Fox 5 recently about how Harris and her mother helped her when she was going through an abusive situation at home. The two lost touch after high school, but Kagan said she reached out after seeing Harris on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" years later, and they “picked up like time stood still.” “I know she impacted my life, that I may not be where I am today had it not been for her intervention back then, but to hear that I impacted her life too, was really, really special,” Kagan added. Harris began her speech by taking the torch from Biden, who did, in the end, pass it, but not without some drama along the way. “To our president, Joe Biden, when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude,” she said. “Your record is extraordinary as history will show, and your character is inspiring and Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both.” The shoutout only highlighted the fact that Biden, who spoke on Monday, was not at the convention Thursday. Earlier in the evening, Biden tweeted a photo of him and Jill watching the convention on TV. Harris walked out on stage to loud cheers that went on for what felt like a while — so much so that after several minutes and multiple “thank yous,” Harris tried to quiet the applause by saying: “Let’s get to business.” Harris thanked her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, at the top of her speech. It's a special day not only because she's making history as the first Black woman and first Asian American to be nominated for president but also because it's her 10th wedding anniversary. She wished a teary ""Dougie"" a happy anniversary and he blew her a kiss back as his daughter, Ella, pat his shoulder. It is prime time on the final night of the DNC and one of the main speakers is … a Republican. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., has stood alongside Democrats against Trump since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and served as one of two Republicans on the House committee investigating the attack. He spent his speech calling out his own party for abandoning conservatism in favor of Trumpism. And he invited fellow Republicans to vote for Harris for the values that they share with her over those they don’t with Trump: Adam Kinzinger’s speech tonight was just another reminder that, unlike the Republican convention in Milwaukee, this convention is about reaching out to a broader base of people in the country. It was about speaking to all people and not just one narrow wing of one party. And a consistent theme of reclaiming freedom.  As Kinzinger said, “The Democrats are as patriotic as us. They love this country just as much as we do.” The convention has been full of Republican speakers, sheriffs, former Republicans and people who still identify as Republicans. It's about inviting people to be a part of a movement and including them, which is not just the right feel-good thing to do, it's a smart political strategy. Actor and Democratic National Convention stalwart Eva Longoria used English, Spanish and Spanglish to tout Harris in her speech tonight. As with other convention speakers who know Spanish, Longoria threw in some Spanish as she was speaking, noting at one point that Americans are one big family, adding “somos familia” afterward. But then she went further and used Spanglish, that cringey American amalgam of both languages familiar from high-school Spanish classes, chain Mexican restaurant advertisements and awkward conversations. “In the Latino community, in our community, we have a saying ‘si se puede,’ which means ‘yes, we can,’” she said, citing the Obama-era slogan. “But tonight, I’m hear to tell you, ‘Yes, she can,’ so we’re going to say ‘she, se puede.’” That was a pretty powerful moment from Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Marine veteran, who capped off a series of Arizona-based speakers with a speech focused on the valor of military service and the importance of providing aid for veterans.  Gallego invited veterans onstage who have gone into politics — people he said come from city halls and state capitols, as well as the U.S House and Senate. Democrats like Rep. Ted Lieu of California, Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Illinois and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona all joined Gallego as he denounced Trump for disrespecting veterans. I have been to a lot of conventions, including the 2008 Obama convention in Denver (and that one was pretty great). But this one feels the most joyful, the most authentic, and the most connected to the big, diverse country we all live in. Part of it is removing some of the formality, bringing in more fun, changing up the programming, and making sure there are surprises. “Big Gretch” was the jolt that this night needed after a few low energy segments. The Michigan governor was charming, effusive, and hit Trump hard again and again in her speech. When it became clear that Biden might actually have to drop out of the race earlier this summer, Whitmer’s name was one of those floated to replace him as the nominee. She ultimately declined to challenge Harris once he stepped aside. But if this speech is any indication, Whitmer is going to be a strong potential contender eight years from now. Leon Panetta is a guy who has done pretty much every job in Washington. He took the stage to bolster Harris’ foreign policy cred as a former Defense secretary and CIA director. (He was also a congressman from California and chief of staff to Bill Clinton.)  Harris “understands what our military is for. The role of our military is to defend us from foreign enemies. It is not to threaten Americans, and as sure as hell, isn’t to put immigrants in camps.” This is in reference to Trump’s plans to use the military on American soil to conduct his promised “largest deportation program in history” and break up peaceful protests. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia took the stage alongside shooting survivors and victims’ family members as each of them spoke about how gun violence has affected them: Abbey Clements, a teacher who survived the Sandy Hook shooting; Kimberly Mata-Rubio, a mother whose daughter was killed in the Uvalde school shooting; Melody McFadden, who as a child witnessed her mother’s fatal shooting by an abusive partner and whose niece was killed by a stray bullet on Myrtle Beach in 2014; and Edgar Vilchez, a college sophomore who saw his classmate get killed in a drive-by shooting in 2022.  Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, a gun control activist, also gave a spirited speech. Giffords resigned from Congress in 2012 after being shot in the head during a mass shooting and assassination attempt. “I learned to walk again one step at a time. I learned to talk again one word at a time,” she said. “My friend Kamala will be a great president. She is tough. She has grit,” Giffords added. “Kamala can beat the gun lobby. She can fight gun trafficking.” Democrats wondering whether Harris made the right choice in her running mate had a good chance to check out one of the top contenders on Thursday. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly was the Washington insiders’ pick for most likely running mate due to his compelling personal biography and status as a swing-state senator. But his speech Thursday was workmanlike at best. He had a nice line about having to follow his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and singer Pink, but he didn’t sell it particularly well. The rest of the speech wasn’t particularly exciting. He spoke about the importance of teamwork and cited his experience as a U.S. Navy combat pilot and an astronaut.  If anyone was wondering if Harris should have picked Kelly instead, he didn’t give them any new reason in this speech. Mark Kelly shows why he wasn’t chosen to be the vice president nominee. He has honorably served the country, but he lacks any of the charisma or wow factor that is necessary in politics today. His dry performance tonight, in contrast to the raucous Walz speech last night, really makes you appreciate how big a whiff that would have been. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who took himself out of the search for a running mate, also gave a workmanlike speech that didn’t change anyone’s mind about Harris’ ultimate pick. Alecia Beth Hart Moore, better known as the modern icon Pink (or, P!nk), has been recording bangers for the last quarter decade. Yes, that is not a typo. But Pink’s longevity is only one part of her impressive legacy. More than the tens of millions of albums sold and world tours completed, it’s Pink’s pioneering brand of popp-y, punk-y empowerment that has always made her stand out. Years before it was common, or cool, Pink was penning anthems that reassured young women and girls everywhere that they mattered; that they were enough.  She pushed back, hard, on unrealistic beauty standards, George W. Bush and misogyny. She refused to apologize for her sexuality, her politics, her hair or her attitude. She spawned a generation of fans — myself included — who revered her authenticity, her passion and her talent. And that’s to say nothing of her live performances. Find me another pop star in her 30s who performs a Cirque du Soleil show while belting. I’ll wait. Tonight, she performed her rallying cry single “What About Us” with her daughter Willow Sage. And it was pretty “f----- perfect.” I’ll admit, even though my family still lives in Flint, Michigan, I hadn’t heard about Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson until tonight. He recounted the time in 2020 when, at the height of the George Floyd protests, he had his officers put down their riot gear to march with protesters in Flint Township. (Flint Township, I’ll note for accuracy’s sake, is a suburb of Flint itself.) It’s good to see that Swanson has kept that same energy four years later, as he compared that act with Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. He further added that Harris “has served America by keeping us safer, and I can testify firsthand that where I come from, crime is down.” Those are the kind of stats that Trump didn’t bother mentioning when he was in Michigan earlier this week, an hour away in Howell, to lie about crime. Comedian D.L. Hughley just took the stage and torched Trump as only a comedian could. The key headline from Hughley’s speech was his apology for having previously spread falsehoods about Harris’s prosecutorial record. But first he made sure to get a few shots in.  “If [Trump] keeps sliding in the polls the way he is, the only way he can keep Kamala out of the White House is if he buys it and refuses to rent it to her,” Hughley said, referencing Trump’s history with discriminatory housing accuations. Hughley also got in a dig about the “Republicans for Kamala” group. “I guess Donald Trump will finally know what it’s like when you get left for a younger woman,” he said. Earlier this week, I wrote about how Democrats made the second night of the DNC feel like “Def Comedy Jam” with all of the biting Trump jokes. In Hughley, Dems platformed an actual star from the hit series. The president is rooting Harris on from 2,000 miles away in California. Harris’ niece Meena Harris took the stage along with the vice president’s stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, and her goddaughter Helena Hudlin. Emhoff (whose dress, by the way, was phenomenal) said that when Harris came into her life at the age of 14, “she was patient, caring and always took me seriously.” Hudlin told the crowd that Harris’ “advice means everything, whether it’s pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn’t feel so hopeful.” It was a major contrast with the character witnesses that Trump brought to the stage last month at the RNC, that’s for sure. Unlike then, none of the speakers tonight are Harris’ employees. In what may be one of the cuter moments ever staged at a political convention, Harris’ great-nieces Amara and Leela Ajagu joined actress Kerry Washington on stage to teach the audience “how to say our auntie’s’ name.” “First you say ‘comma’ like a comma in a sentence,” said Amara.  “Then you say ‘la,’ like la-la-la-la-la,” added Leela. The girls then led the crowd in saying “comma” and “la.” The moment was cute, but there was a serious subtext. Trump and GOP allies such as Rep. Nancy Mace have repeatedly mispronounced Harris’ first name. While possibly understandable a few years ago, this sign of disrespect is pretty obviously intentional today. Country trio The Chicks just took the stage to sing the national anthem. The country music industry has been in the spotlight throughout the week, with performances from Mickey Guyton and Maren Morris, as well. I can’t help but think of The Chicks invitation as a bit of a thumb in Republicans’ eyes. After all, The Chicks are true victims of the “cancel culture” conservative types often complain about. The group faced backlash and was effectively blackballed by many in the country music industry in 2003 after they publicly denounced George Bush for launching the Iraq War. Democrats have been having a hell of a party this week. A big question that one important group watching Harris tonight wants to know is whether they can feel welcome joining the fun. There is a bloc of voters that lean right but can’t get down with Donald Trump, and they will be looking for some assurance that Harris is running to represent all Americans, not just the progressive left. No one is expecting her to promote conservative ideas, but a speech that speaks to the mainstream, projects a strong America on the world stage, and promises basic competence in governance could go a long way to broaden her coalition. Newly minted Olympic gold medalist Steph Curry just made an appearance to endorse Harris via video. Curry said his experience winning gold with the USA men’s basketball team in France helped inspire him to back Harris.  “That unity on and off the court reminded us all that together we can do all things and continue to inspire the world,"" Curry said. ""That’s why I believe that Kamala as president could bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward. This is about preserving hope and belief in our country, and making sure families can be taken care of during their most precious times.” Curry’s coach Steve Kerr endorsed Harris on the first night of the DNC and performed Curry’s “night night” three-point celebration to mock Trump. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: It’s important to remember to step back. A month ago, Harris was writing an entirely different speech. Normally, you work on these speeches for months. You have polling, you have focus groups, and you have meetings with senior advisors. This is a shorter runway. This is also about tomorrow. It’s not just about tonight. What she needs to do is not a policy speech but an inspiring speech — a vision. Tonight, she needs to ask people to go out there and get active. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. We just finished a stretch of speakers focused on climate change and Democrats’ efforts to mitigate its effects. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland struck out at Trump’s claim that climate change is a hoax and how he “made it easier for big companies to poison our air and water.” Content creator John Russell took the stage after a video he produced highlighted Trump’s faux support for labor and the clean energy jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act. And Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., the first Gen Z member of Congress, reminded the crowd that “the climate crisis isn’t some far-off threat — it is here.” What a difference this is from DNCs past. “Climate was not a campaign issue eight or 12 years ago,” Manish Bapna, president of the NRDC Action Fund, told NPR ahead of the convention. “It was extremely difficult to get climate into one of the major debates, it was seen as a peripheral and not a central issue.” Fast-forward to today, and it’s a crucial part of the case that Democrats are making for Harris. Frost, who was an organizer before being elected as the first Gen Z member of Congress, delivered a short, punchy speech focused on the chief concern among younger generations. “Fighting the climate crisis is patriotic. And unlike Donald Trump, our patriotism is more than some slogan on a hat. It’s about actually giving a damn about the people who live in this country,” Frost said. “Because when you love someone, you want them to have clean air. When you love someone, you want them to have safe drinking water. And when you love someone, you want them to have a dignified job.” There’s been a parade of prosecutors, current and former, onstage tonight to speak to Harris’ background. That includes Amy Resner, who worked alongside Harris in California early in her career, and Tristan Snell, who prosecuted the case against Trump University. “I can’t wait to see her prosecute the case against Donald Trump on the debate stage in September,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a fellow former state attorney general, told the crowd. “We face a stark choice in this election, a felon and con man, or a dedicated prosecutor.” The moment highlighting Harris’s prosecutorial accomplishments featured Nathan Horns, a student victimized by Corinthian Schools’ predatory lending practices and false assurances to students. As attorney general, Harris filed a lawsuit that ultimately helped secure billions of dollars in student loan forgiveness for students who borrowed to attend Corinthian. Naturally, this provided an opening to discuss Trump’s infamous, multimillion-dollar settlement with defrauded students enrolled in the now-defunct Trump University.  Tristan Snell, a lawyer who prosecuted Trump University before the settlement, said, “Donald Trump ripped off his biggest fans and made $5 million in profit.” He adds, “Kamala Harris fought scammers like him” and will fight for the people as president. Trump’s rally in Arizona tomorrow will include a special guest, his campaign says. The rally will take place just hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running in the presidential race as an independent candidate, holds a news conference in Phoenix (a 30-minute drive from Glendale), during which he is reportedly expected to announce an end to his presidential bid and endorse Trump. New York City Councilman Yusuf Salaam, one of the exonerated “Central Park Five,” said it plainly: “He wanted us dead.”  The brutal rape and attempted murder of a female jogger in Central Park in the spring of 1989 represented the apotheosis of fears over crime in 1980s New York City. But before due process could run its course, a Manhattan real estate developer named Donald Trump infamously paid for a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of the teenagers accused of the crime. The teens were convicted and served prison time, but they were exonerated. They didn’t do it. And Trump has never acknowledged his error. In fact, he’s expressed support for extrajudicial killings in other countries as a crime-preventive measure.  Watching Salaam and his fellow exonerees speak to the nation three-and-a-half decades removed from their wrongful arrests and convictions is a striking moment — and also a prescient warning of what Trump would do on his retribution tour if we were to win another term. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Daily today, Walz's speech delivered a ""communal patriotism"" that was in ""striking contrast"" to Donald Trump. But it the vice presidential nominee's personal story about his family infertility struggles — and his children's reaction to it — that stole the show. ""You are my entire world and I love you,"" Walz said to his daughter, Hope, and his son, Gus. Hope made a heart symbol with her hands as her brother stood up beside her, teared up and shouted, ""That's my dad!"" The Rev. Al Sharpton leaned into his background at the pulpit with his speech, riffing hard on Harris’ unofficial campaign slogan “We won’t go back” to get the crowd on their feet. And he brought it home hard while paraphrasing the Bible: Rachel Maddow speaking on MSNBC moments ago: As Kamala Harris gets ready to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president of the United States, it has been 152 years since Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to ever run for president in this country — long before women even had the right to vote. It has been 52 years since Shirley Chisholm became the first Black candidate for president. It has been eight years since Hillary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.  Tonight, Kamala Harris will accept the nomination of her party as the culminating event of what has been a supercharged, energetic, profoundly enthusiastic convention. Television ratings, to the extent that they matter in the world, so far show the Democrats have pretty widely outpaced the Republican convention in terms of how many Americans have been watching this thing each night thus far. But it’s really only the beginning. Tonight’s finale from the Democratic Convention in Chicago will start a 75-day sprint to election night. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Taking back the idea of “patriotism” from Republicans has been a major theme this week, and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., was a great choice to continue that trend. Slotkin, who is running for the U.S. Senate, denounced Trump’s desire to withdraw from the world, and she told listeners to “proudly claim your patriotism. You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag but spit in the face of freedom. It represents you.” Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I can just tell you that when Senator Warren was announced and started to walk on that stage, this entire arena erupted. That sustained applause was on a similar level to the way that Tim Walz was received. It was on a similar level to the way Bill Clinton was received. It was loud, it was sustained and you could see her get emotional.  I think it’s poignant because it really speaks to where the Democratic Party has moved. This is a party that is unashamed of being progressive and unashamed of its progressive values.  Warren used to be a Republican back in the day. She then shifted and became a Democrat. She's sort of defined and maligned on the right as some socialist but she’s not. She’s just an academic who became a politician to try to stop rich people and corporations from cheating people. That’s a basic value. It's now a mainstream Democratic Party progressive value. I think that’s why she’s feeling that love. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Near the end of her speech, Sen. Elizabeth Warren cracked that she wouldn’t trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to move her couch. Get it? Of course you do. The ubiquitous joke built on an obviously fake premise drove Republicans batty for weeks. It was effective at highlighting their hypocrisy of abiding by nine years of defamatory falsehoods by Trump.  But it’s over. The joke is beat. Remember when the first ""Borat"" movie came out and it was the funniest thing in years and everyone was doing Sacha Baron Cohen’s ridiculous accent? Remember how annoying it was six months later?  That’s where the couch joke is now. And if Warren’s crack wasn’t contrived enough, the next speaker, Rep. Jason Crow, took another jab with a reference to a “couch commando.” Dems, it’s over. There’s comedy to be mined out there. Find another joke. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey echoed Harris’ attacks on price gouging, arguing that Americans are being “ripped off” by big corporations. He started by citing the price of diapers, which has skyrocketed recently. This increase isn’t due to inflation, Casey argued. “The corporations say your prices are up only because their costs are up,” he said. “They’re selling you a lie.” As with Harris, Casey said that while most companies are playing by the rules, diaper prices were up because of “food conglomerates” who are “extorting” consumers, comparing them to people who hoarded toilet paper during the pandemic. The Biden administration has struggled to find a response to inflation, but Harris took a new line on the issue earlier this month when she began talking about targeting price-gouging. Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado took the baton from ""SNL"" cast member Kenan Thompson to lead tonight’s Project 2025 takedown. As I mentioned earlier, quick, plain-spoken and easily digestible segments like these speak to Democrats’ focus on social media-friendly content at this year’s convention — content that can be shared long after the DNC ends. A standing ovation for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as she takes the podium. The crowd cheered for so long that the senator began to tear up, and tried to get the crowd to settle down. It’s worth remembering how popular she was among the base during her own run for president in 2020. Warren’s speech was heavy on boosting Harris’ support over how she has taken on corporations and big banks in favor of the little guy in America. It was the core of Warren’s own message when running for president in 2020, one that has since then become a centerpiece of Democratic messaging writ large. These days it’s hard to imagine a Democrat who would stand in front of a crowd this big and try to defend price gouging from corporations or billionaires who don’t pay their fair share in taxes. Harris will officially accept the Democratic nomination tonight, but she also celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary with second gentleman Doug Emhoff today. They both posted tributes to each other on social media, with Harris calling Emhoff “the best partner I could ask for.” The convention voted earlier this week to approve the official Democratic platform. Funnily enough, the text itself was approved by the committee that drafted it before Biden dropped out, leaving references to his re-election scattered throughout. Harris’ name is mentioned only as a part of the Biden-Harris administration and when talking about some of the initiatives she has spearheaded as vice president. As such, it stands to reason that there may be parts of the platform that she doesn’t fully agree with. For example, we don’t know if she is OK that this year’s plank deleted any reference to abolishing the death penalty. We also don’t know whether any of her own policy proposals might contradict those within the platform. It’s not binding on anyone running — but it would be nice to get some clarity about what she might do that would be different from a second Biden term. I, for one, would not have guessed ahead of this week that the DNC would have its own in-house hypeman: DJ Metro, on the ones and twos. He’s been pumping out jams since the convention gaveled in tonight and the people in the audience are loving it. So do the camera operators who have been loving snagging footage of the attendees dancing. I’m not trying to harsh anyone’s buzz, but I can’t help but think it’s going to be very funny to look back on these moments 30 years from now. As evidence, I submit to you this video from the 1996 DNC of attendees dancing to “The Macarena” without any further comment: After Republicans invited folks like Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock to give their convention a celebrity presence, Democrats raised the bar with a convention featuring celebs like Oprah, John Legend and Mindy Kaling. But some of the star power has had more of an impact behind the scenes. The biopic that is set to play before Harris’ speech tonight was directed by Reginald Hudlin, the famed director and producer behind classic films like “Boomerang” and “House Party.” Some more recent Hudlin films that have garnered critical acclaim include “Marshall,” which starred Chadwick Boseman, and “The Black Godfather,” a star-studded Netflix documentary about music executive Clarence Avant. Hudlin met Harris years ago through his wife, Chrisette, and the Hudlins’ son Alexander is the VP’s godson. Alexander spoke alongside Harris’ niece and nephew at the DNC last night. Jacob Soboroff speaking on MSNBC moments ago: The RNC kicked off in the wake of the horrific assassination attempt of Trump. And there was a lot of conversation about how it was going to feature a unifying message — which turned out to be anything but. Instead there was a deeply divisive message, obviously. And remember what was happening on those convention signs? They said “mass deportation now.” It was literally a message of kicking millions of people out of the country, many of whom, especially from a place like California, are our neighbors, are our colleagues, and people we know very well. Obviously that’s not the tone or the tenor of the DNC at all. And it’s so easy to feel the difference standing down on the floor. Those folks at the Republican convention, they were enthusiastic, and they were happy to be there. But this is an entirely different thing.  These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Affordable housing is deeply lacking across the country, a crisis that the federal government has only just begun to address. It makes sense then that several of the early speakers tonight have chosen to focus on it. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge told the audience that Harris “knows housing is a human right and a pathway to the middle class.” Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., told the audience about her work as California attorney general to deal with predatory loans during the Great Recession and her dedication to affordable housing. Accordingly, one of the first policy proposals that Harris has put forward since ascending to the top of the ticket is to provide $25,000 in aid to first-time homebuyers for a down payment. Interestingly enough, neither Fudge nor Lieu directly mentioned Harris’ proposal in their speeches. Sen. Alex Padilla, who succeeded Harris as a U.S. senator from California when she became vice president, noted in his brief remarks that she’s good with his kids. “Whenever she sees Roman, Alejandro and Diego, she greets them with kindness and respect,” he said. “Literally meeting them on their level to speak to them and to listen.” Padilla’s remarks serve as a major contrast with Trump, who once flubbed a simple Christmas Eve call with a 7-year-old. Rep. Ted Lieu of California kicked off his speech with a jab at Trump for his ridiculous claim that the Harris campaign was using artificial intelligence to fabricate crowds in photos.  “As a computer science major, I am so impressed with how large this AI-generated crowd looks tonight,"" Lieu said. Lieu has never missed an opportunity to make a mockery of Trump. Michael Steele speaking on MSNBC moments ago: There are three pieces that will go into Harris’ speech tonight: the bio, the acknowledgment of the work she’s done with Joe Biden and then, of course, where she wants to go. What does President Harris look like and sound like? We should hopefully get a first taste of that this evening. There are a bunch of gnarly issues out there that are waiting for her that will have to be addressed almost immediately upon taking the oath of office. I think the American people would like to get some sense of what that feels like and looks like for them. It’s not just the economy, it’s global affairs, it’s reproductive health, it’s educating their children or it’s starting their small business.      I remember well from when I was in school that teachers are adept at tagging-teaming. So it was with Rebecca Pringle, head of the National Education Association, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Walz’s background as a former public school teacher has been featured heavily this week, so it seems fitting that Pringle leaned into it in her speech. She also took on the job of being the cheerleader for Coach Walz and Harris, while Weingarten hit harder at Trump and Vance in her speech Democrats have a well-deserved reputation for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. And yet they have been almost aggressively “in array” for the past month. There’s no secret sauce to reveal. A historically unpopular incumbent president — already facing slim odds at re-election — gave a debate performance so catastrophic it will make historians forget about Richard Nixon’s flop-sweat in 1960 and George H.W. Bush impatiently looking at his watch in 1992. But Joe Biden then dropped out of the race. His replacement, Kamala Harris, benefits from a surge of non-negativity left in the wake of his exit. After his retirement party on opening night, Biden has been an afterthought at this convention. But try to imagine tonight as the capper of a weeklong hype party to re-elect Biden. To get there, Biden would have withstood a seven-week-long rebellion by the leadership of his party, top donors and activist groups. He’d have to continue to insist the polls were wrong, that Donald Trump and the right’s relentless attacks on his cognitive decline weren’t leaving a mark on his approval ratings, and that his choice to stay in the race was actually a selfless act and destined to succeed. He’d have had to make the case to the American people that he’s the present and the future of the party. It’s hard to imagine Nancy Pelosi in the crowd chanting “We love Joe!” in that scenario, although she’d probably still have dutifully shown up. But that’s another universe entirely. Harris has been a top voice in the Biden administration in condemning the rising death toll in Gaza and the deep suffering of Palestinian civilians in the enclave. Since she launched her presidential bid in July, her campaign has also held meetings with the Uncommitted movement, which aims to push the party on a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. But whether or not she would make a significant policy shift on the issue if she’s elected is a big unknown. In her speech tonight, Harris may denounce the killings of civilians in Gaza — as she has in the past — which is an arguably safe position to take, politically speaking. But the vice president, who still has not released detailed policy plans so far and has been described as risk-averse, is unlikely to even subtly criticize Israel’s military conduct in Gaza. Never one to cede the spotlight, Trump attempted a little counterprogramming by visiting the U.S.-Mexico border today. Standing at a podium in Cochise County, Arizona, the former president read short but graphic descriptions of sexual assaults, robberies and murders committed by immigrants. “With your vote, we will seal the border, stop the invasion and launch the largest deportation effort in American history,” he said. The campaign stop was meant to highlight the issue of immigration, but Trump’s grim and graphic remarks also provided a stark contrast with the optimistic tone of the Democratic National Convention all week. On Friday, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, will hold a rally in Glendale outside Phoenix. Ari Melber, speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I’m reminded of the song Public Service Announcement by Jay-Z where he says, “Allow me to reintroduce myself.” That’s something that people do even when they’re well known. Tonight is Vice President Kamala Harris’ reintroduction on the grand stage. In that song, Jay-Z says, “My homie Strict told me, ‘Dude finish your breakfast’...Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this. Shoot at you actors like movie directors.” That’s not only a double entendre, he’s calling out his opponents, his foes as actors, as inauthentic, while he’s the real deal.  I’m looking for Harris to build on what Gov. Tim Walz did last night. She’s at the top of the ticket. I’m expecting her to speak on these actors, these phonies, these fakes. That’s not just Donald Trump but the part of the MAGA movement that has tried to steal and fake what they represent — “real America” or family values or football or freedom.  All three days have been leading up to this moment. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Following in the grand tradition of the Oscars and other televised events, this year’s DNC has consistently run behind schedule. But that may be a calculated risk.  While it’s true that running late pushes some of the big speeches out of prime time, that isn’t really the disaster that it might have been a few years ago. Most viewers who willingly tune into four nights of convention programming are probably already on board with the Harris campaign. With so many streaming platforms, cable TV channels, and video games out there to fill your night, less plugged-in voters are not forced to watch conventions anymore. But they’ll still run across them, when they turn to social media, where the highlight reels of the big speeches will be playing on repeat in the coming days. Democratic leaders have refused to grant a speaking slot to a Palestinian American on the main stage, the Uncommitted movement said Wednesday. Members of the movement, which hopes to pressure Harris on an arms embargo to Israel and on a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, have been holding a sit-in outside the United Center since Wednesday evening. The group’s leader, Abbas Alawieh, has said that Harris’ campaign made an offer of a private meeting instead, which the group rejected. Now, party leaders are now facing increasing pressure from uncommitted delegates, Democratic lawmakers and outside groups, such as United Auto Workers and the Sunrise Movement, to allow a Palestinian American to address the convention on its final night. Earlier today, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in an interview with Zeteo: “If we are to say that we’re a party that is inclusive, that unity is our strength, we have to make room. There’s still time.”   As Harris takes the stage for the biggest speech of her political career, she may be leaning on some old lessons for public speaking. As a senator in 2019, she shared some of that advice with a young woman. The moment, which was caught on tape, was then posted on Harris’ social media channels. “I never miss a chance to speak with our future leaders, especially young women,” Harris wrote on Facebook. “One recently asked me how to become a better public speaker. My answer: ‘Remember, people need to know what you know!’” In the video, Harris tells the girl to imagine that she’s the only person on the Titanic who knows that the ship is going to sink and needs to tell everyone. “If you are on the Titanic and you know the ship is about to sink, and you’re the only one who knows, are you going to worry about how you look and how you sound? No, because the thing that’s most important is that everyone knows what you know.” The Harris campaign has received a lot of praise for its social media strategy. I’ve been following along with this week’s DNC programming with that in mind, while picking out portions of the convention that have seem tailor-made for social media. When the campaign announced that it would offer an online stream of the event that could play in vertical format, as well as invite popular influencers to attend in person, it showed they were prioritizing viewers who might be watching the convention online and accustomed to getting their information there. And this week, various segments in-between speakers have been produced in a style or written in the same punchy tone as political content you’ve likely seen go viral. That includes the “two lies and a lie” segment that aired on Monday, the Vox-style explainer video narrated by Harris about Trump’s tariffs plan that aired Tuesday, and the brief Project 2025 interludes we’ve seen throughout the week — in particular, the one starring “SNL” cast member Kenan Thompson. It has all felt like Democratic Party officials recognize that the Harris campaign has developed a lot of momentum on social media — and want to keep feeding the audience they’ve established there with familiar content. Democrats, thrilled by Harris’ “joyful” campaign, have really leaned into “politics as entertainment” at the convention this week. In between warnings about the dire stakes in this election, they’ve had huge musical acts (with Pink and The Chicks scheduled to perform later, and a big mystery guest who some pundits have speculated is Beyoncé), DJ-led dance breaks and Hollywood celebrities as keynote speakers. Most attendees certainly seem to be enjoying themselves, but whether you perceive it as unbridled enthusiasm for Harris or as a garish political spectacle may depend on how you feel about American politics in general. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: There are two colors you see a lot in the audience. One is blue, unsurprisingly, but overwhelmingly, the color is white. And the symbolism is not lost on me and it’s not lost on a lot of people. This is a moment women in this country have been waiting a long time for, which is the elevation of a woman to the top of the Democratic Party and I would say there’s even more than maybe there was in 2016 or renewed optimism in the wake of Donald Trump years and the defeat that Hillary Clinton suffered. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. The DNC just released some additional speakers for tonight.  As someone who lived through the Clinton and Obama years, this DNC feels like a major shift has occurred. Gone is the almost apologetic tone that Democrats adopted in the aftermath of blowout losses in 1980, when “Reagan Democrats” voted for the Republican nominee, and the “shellacking” of the 2010 midterms. Instead, what we’ve seen in speech after speech is a party that knows what it stands for and what it stands against. Within the past 15 years, the Democrats have gone from a party with a sizable conservative wing (either fiscally like the Blue Dogs, socially on abortion and gay rights, or both) to one that loudly champions workers over corporate greed, protections for LGBTQ Americans, and abortion rights for all. There’s still a lot of room for improvement on a number of issues, but the difference between then and now shouldn’t be taken for granted. Social media and media pundits are abuzz with speculation about whether music icons Beyoncé and Taylor Swift — arguably THE biggest names in music right now — will appear tonight at the DNC to support Harris. Pop singer Pink and country trio The Chicks (formerly known as the Dixie Chicks) are already slated to perform tonight. But fans can't help but wonder if Queen Bey and T-Swift will also show up. With Beyoncé's permission, Harris is using her song ""Freedom"" as her campaign anthem. It's been featured heavily during the convention, on the campaign trail, and in a new campaign ad. Some speculated that White House political director Emmy Ruiz's tweet this afternoon hinted at a Beyoncé performance (she tweeted a bee emoji, a possible reference to ""Bey."" She also tweeted after that ""my 6 year old took my phone."" Hmm. To this Taylor Swift fan, it seems improbable that she would make an appearance tonight for a couple of reasons: 1.) When she endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, it wasn't until a few weeks before the election, and 2.) In an Instagram post yesterday, she said the foiled terror plot that canceled Eras Tour shows in Vienna filled her with ""a new sense of fear."" It wouldn't seem surprising if she wanted to avoid making any political statements in light of that. But hey, we'll just have to wait and see. It’s kind of weird: Listen to just about any high-profile Democrat talk about Trump and the GOP presidential ticket these days, and odds are it won’t be long before you hear the word “weird.” As Ja’han Jones recently noted for The ReidOut Blog, “weird” might be far too mild for the likes of Trump, but there’s little doubt that the descriptor has rattled him — the former president insisted at a campaign event Monday that he and his running mate, JD Vance, are “extremely normal people.”  Ja’han also explained that the rhetorical strategy has etymological roots in California slang: “In Harris’ home state of California, for example, “weird” — for many young nonwhite people — doesn’t just mean quirky or unique, it’s used as an insult. That’s why there’s a genre of TikToks featuring young Californians talking about how being called “weird” — or its variant, “a weirdo” — is an offense that basically amounts to fighting words.” Read Ja’han’s full piece below. Check out these highlight reels from the first three nights of the convention to get caught up. In many ways, Harris’ speech tonight will be more like a campaign launch than a typical acceptance speech. Because of the truncated way in which she kicked off her run this year, the vice president did not have a big kickoff rally to introduce her big themes and set the stage for the campaign. Instead, she visited the already-running Biden campaign headquarters and then jumped into routine campaigning, with one big policy speech on economics.  That makes tonight the moment for Harris to lay out her vision for the presidency, make the case for her policy agenda, which remains a work in progress, and tell her personal story. It probably won’t be too different from the kickoff speech she had for her ill-fated 2020 run for the Democratic presidential nomination, in which she talked about how her parents met and how she viewed the role of prosecutor as helping fight for fairness. Harris, of course, is the keynote speaker tonight. Don't expect her to address the convention before 11 p.m. ET. Here's who is expected to speak before Harris tonight (in no particular order):"
DNC viewers just got Bey-fished,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-dnc-rumor-kamala-harris-rcna167895,"Despite the rumors, there was not a special appearance from Mrs. Beyoncé Knowles-Carter on Thursday, the fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention. Dozens of attendees who wore “Cowboy Kamala” fits tonight for nothing are likely devastated at the lack of a performance from the superstar. This despite TMZ promising us that she would be performing, as did several dozen random people on social media who insisted that she was there in Chicago. “Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there,"" a representative for Beyoncé told NBC News on Thursday as the DNC headed into final hours. “The report of a performance is untrue.” Look, I don’t know who started this rumor. Maybe it was a bored convention staffer whose deadpan is a little too dry to have their sarcasm register. Maybe it was James Taylor in revenge for having his number cut on Night 1 of the DNC. Maybe it was some evil genius on the Harris team who figured out a way to get people to tune in who might not otherwise watch and stay until the balloons have dropped.  In the end, we are all the more deceived for Thursday's ruse. But, if you really think about it, what is a recording of Beyonce’s “Freedom,” the campaign’s anthem that played at the close of Harris’ speech, if not a “performance?”"

Yes, that is not a typo. But Pink’s longevity is only one part of her impressive legacy. More than the tens of millions of albums sold and world tours completed, it’s Pink’s pioneering brand of popp-y, punk-y empowerment that has always made her stand out. Years before it was common, or cool, Pink was penning anthems that reassured young women and girls everywhere that they mattered; that they were enough.  She pushed back, hard, on unrealistic beauty standards, George W. Bush and misogyny. She refused to apologize for her sexuality, her politics, her hair or her attitude. She spawned a generation of fans — myself included — who revered her authenticity, her passion and her talent. And that’s to say nothing of her live performances. Find me another pop star in her 30s who performs a Cirque du Soleil show while belting. I’ll wait. Tonight, on the star-studded final night of the Democratic National Convention, she performed her rallying cry single “What About Us” with her daughter Willow Sage.

Why it matters that Kamala Harris has two white guys in her corner,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 1:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-white-guys-doug-emhoff-tim-walz-rcna166670,"“Historic,” the word most often used to describe Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential candidacy, is just shorthand for the fact that in nearly 250 years of this country’s existence, no one who looks like her has ever been at the top of a major party’s ticket.  That’s got nothing to do with ability. Racism and sexism are rigorous gatekeepers of America’s halls of power. Consequently, the mere presence of a biracial Black American woman of Indian descent in the race at this stage is a challenge to the status quo. But Harris’ run is also historic in another, less discussed way.  Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. On the campaign trail, Doug Emhoff and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Harris’ husband and vice presidential running mate, respectively — embody figures rarely before observed in American life: white men who know their place. That is to say, white men who know their supportive place and seem to occupy it without hesitation or resentment. This is the first time our national political stage has hosted two white men whose role is to passionately champion a Black woman all the way to the White House.  Obviously, it’s vitally important not to diminish Harris as the main character in this political story. But it’s still worth examining the optics presented by Walz and Emhoff, because those two white guys are defying and potentially redefining America’s vision of authority and leadership. Amid all the racist, sexist MAGA detritus that surrounds us, the Harris campaign is a necessary glimpse at what American power, equality and truly inclusive democracy could someday look like. That redefinition would be notable in any moment, but it’s particularly important in the dark timeline we find ourselves on. Former President Donald Trump’s frequent attacks on Black women journalists and insults toward Black women lawmakers have energized masses of racist misogynists. The corrosive spillage of MAGA identity politics — in addition to innumerable anti-woman and anti-anti-racist laws, policy proposals and civil rights rollbacks — has included the absurd notion that white masculinity is in crisis. Walz seems to have understood the assignment from the jump. During vetting interviews, Walz reportedly volunteered that he wasn’t “angling for anything else” and emphasized, “This is not about me.” Both quotes suggest Walz not only understood the level of deference and loyalty required, but also took pains to establish that he would have no issues offering both to a Black woman superior.  “Being strategically invisible or staying in the background will require a humility that many white men have never had to demonstrate,” Sheletta Brundidge, a Minnesota-based Black woman author, wrote in a Minnesota Star Tribune op-ed. “She’s going to be Gladys Knight; he will be a Pip.”  Since his selection, Walz has seemed joyful as second-in-command, radiating an ease in the role that most likely assuages the reflexive discomfort some voters — and particularly white voters — would feel seeing the boss is a Black woman.  The misogynist smears that might allow MAGA types to portray Walz as a “beta” for playing second banana to a Black woman are simply less effective because of his background as a football coach, hunter, gun owner and National Guard veteran. Misogynoir falsely pathologizes Black women as inherently anormal — but as an older, rural-coded Midwestern white man, Walz is regarded as almost aggressively normal — or as the headlines put it, “all-American” and an “everyman.”  The tendency to view Black women with suspicion and hostility — to interpret the mildest pleas for equitable change as inherently dangerous and threatening — remains. But the Harris campaign might succeed in moving the needle a bit on those perceptions.  The same reassurances are provided by Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman- turned-Harris campaign surrogate, whose demonstrations of supportive partnership earned his reputation as a “wife guy” as far back as 2019. Emhoff’s loving advocacy of his wife’s ascendance consistently suggests he feels he “married up” — a sentiment rarely extended to Black women in a system in which even their femininity is routinely questioned. (Right-wing memes questioning both Michelle Obama’s and Harris’ gender are par for the MAGA course.)  Emhoff ditched his career as a firm’s partner attorney to attend to his wife’s, breaking with all gender expectations, especially those attached to white men who have succeeded in corporate America. In positioning himself as the white man happily standing behind a great Black woman, Emhoff exemplifies a breed of white male masculinity in opposition to MAGA’s camp, women-hating, masculinity — one that emphasizes partnership and respect over insecure dominance and superiority. “I’m honored now to have my wife be at the top of the ticket,” Emhoff recently announced on a podcast. “I cannot tell you how proud I am of her.”  Emhoff’s words are a rejection of the idea that Black women’s goals should somehow be contained, that Black women are taking up too much space or vying for spots that somehow always rightfully belong to someone else. And it’s the opposite of the right’s fragile white masculinity model, which views gender equality as oppressive and racial justice as unbearable.  Several decades back, these folks would probably have called Emhoff and Walz “N-word lovers” and kept it moving, but now they use more euphemistic terms. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed Walz is “afraid of testosterone.” Rob Schmitt, a Newsmax anchor, described Walz as “the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people” — a gender and racial turncoat, if you will. Donald Trump Jr., the creative one in the family, predictably labeled the White Dudes for Harris fundraising call “Cucks for Kamala.” And Christopher Rufo, the right-wing architect of the phony “critical race theory” panic, was so apoplectic over the announcement of Walz’s appointment that he spent the whole day firing off social media copes. None of this is to suggest Walz and Emhoff should be lauded as American superheroes. White men are praised enough for doing the absolute barest of minimums on behalf of decency, and “white saviorism” is among our country’s most tired tropes. But the two are working against deeply ingrained, stubbornly persistent and highly damaging ideas about whiteness and maleness, modeling behavior that really shouldn’t be so expectation-defying at this point — and yet.  “How often in 100 days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in 100 days do you get to do something that’s going to impact generations to come?” Walz asked attendees on the White Dudes for Harris call. “And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his ass, sent him on the road?” It’s yet another idea that Harris herself couldn’t push too strongly, lest she set off alarm bells, handing MAGA something to scare white voters over. But the point stands, nonetheless."
The problem(s) with conspiracy theories about revised job data,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-conspiracy-theories-revised-job-data-rcna167837,"When it comes to the U.S. job market, there’s been some tension over the last year or so between the data and the expectations. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to deliberately cool the economy and lower inflation, which was expected to simultaneously reduce hiring. On the other hand, monthly job totals continued to look great. It was against this backdrop that Labor Department delivered some discouraging-but-unsurprising news. NBC News reported: In a statement, White House Chief Economic Adviser Jared Bernstein said the preliminary estimate “doesn’t change the fact that the jobs recovery has been and remains historically strong, delivering solid job and wage gains, strong consumer spending, and record small business creation.” This reaction has the benefit of being accurate. The downward revisions were obviously not good news, but (a) some economists projected an even harsher revision; and (b) by any fair measure, the post-pandemic job growth hasn’t just been impressive, it’s also exceeded even the most optimistic expectations from 2021. Republicans, evidently, don’t quite see it that way. House Speaker Mike Johnson, for example, who’s spent his tenure pretending not to notice American job growth, responded to the Labor Department’s report by saying that “Kamalanomics” — whatever the heck that means — is “crushing our economy.” This is an impossible argument to take seriously, given that the economy remains healthy. Indeed, the idea that the vice president’s economic vision is “crushing” the economy is belied by reality — our economy remains the envy of the world — as the Louisiana congressman really ought to know. But Johnson’s reaction was practically sensible compared to Donald Trump’s. “There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent,” Trump said in a speech this week. The former president added a day later that the White House was caught “manipulating job statistics,” adding, “They wanted it to come out after the election, but somehow it got leaked.” So, a few things. First, the idea that the original job numbers have been proven “fraudulent” is bonkers. These revisions are a standard part of the process: Officials went with the best information available, and that information has now been updated to be more accurate, which is exactly what's happened during every modern administration. Second, no one has been caught “manipulating” anything. Indeed, in 2019 — the third year of the Trump presidency — the Labor Department had a similar report that revised job totals down by roughly 500,000. By Trump’s reasoning, that means his own administration was responsible promoting “fraudulent” job numbers that had been “manipulated” by the Republican White House. Third, I don’t know who “they” are, but the idea that “they” wanted this information to come out after the election “but somehow it got leaked” is simply bananas. In fact, William Beach explained in an online statement, “For those who think the big revision to the BLS jobs numbers ‘leaked’ and was meant to come out after the election, remember that BLS always announces its draft revisions in August and announced this year’s date, August 21, many months ago. It is important to check your facts.” And who’s William Beach? He’s the man Trump appointed to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Voters concerned about the American job market should probably take note: Trump, even now, doesn’t understand the basics of job data."
Supreme Court partially grants GOP bid to enforce Arizona proof-of-citizenship voting law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 12:16 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-republican-rnc-arizona-voting-law-rcna167243,"A divided Supreme Court partially granted an emergency request from the Republican National Committee to enforce an Arizona law that requires documentary proof of citizenship to vote, specifically letting the state require such proof when registering to vote using a state form. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have fully granted the Republican application. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have fully denied it. The GOP went to the high court after a federal appeals court panel approved a district court injunction against the law. The emergency application, from the RNC and the Arizona state Senate president and House speaker, sought to pause (or “stay”) the injunction immediately, to the extent that it makes the state (1) accept voter registration applications via a state form without documentary proof of citizenship and (2) allow voters who have not provided documentary proof of citizenship to cast ballots for president or to vote by mail.  The Supreme Court’s order on Thursday rejected the Republican request when it comes to voting for president or voting by mail. Opposing the Republicans’ bid, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes told the justices that “a stay this close to an election will create chaos and confusion, and in turn undermine the credibility of our elections.” The federal government also opposed the stay, noting that “judicial intervention at this stage would undermine the orderly administration of the election, risking the disfranchisement of thousands of voters who have already registered to vote using the federal form.” The “federal form” refers to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states to “accept and use” a standard federal form to register voters for federal elections. That form requires voters to attest under penalty of perjury that they’re U.S. citizens but doesn’t make them to submit documentary proof. Yet the 2022 Arizona law at issue requires federal form users to submit documentary proof to vote for president or by mail, and makes voters submit such proof when they register using an alternative state form.

Kamala Harris needs to start talking about policing — for Sonya Massey’s sake,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-policy-police-sonya-massey-dnc-rcna166753,"Much of the focus at the Democratic National Convention this week will be on how Vice President Kamala Harris, who will accept her party’s presidential nomination, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, address policy issues. The momentum Harris has generated since she reached the top of the ticket has been sensational but largely based on rhetoric that has provided a jolt of hopefulness to voters seeking an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. While Harris seems to understand the priorities of voters and has released her economic plan, one major policy area that she cannot afford to overlook is the future of civil rights. Last month, after an Illinois sheriff’s deputy shot and killed Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black mother of two who had called police for help, Harris reached out to Massey’s family to offer her condolences. The vice president’s public comments echoed the widespread and noncontroversial sentiment that Massey deserved to be safe. Still, at no point did Harris couple her statements about Massey’s being killed with any real plans to address future police violence in America. It is unclear whether, in this pivotal moment, 10 years after a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, Harris and the Democratic Party are committed not only to protecting existing civil rights but also to expanding them. For those who are concerned with addressing civil rights and police violence, and criminal justice in particular, Harris’ identity as a Black, Asian woman will not be enough. As her campaign begins to roll out more substantive policies around other issues, she must also lay out a concrete agenda around civil rights. Harris’ past as a prosecutor — she was the self-proclaimed “top cop” in California — has generated some skepticism about what policing and criminal justice might look like in a Harris administration. Some of her critics’ concerns are based on a distortion of her record, if not downright misinformation. However, even for the most objective of people, Kamala Harris’ history with regard to criminal justice reform and civil rights can be described as complicated. While she is a Democrat, her policies and practices as a prosecutor would not rank anywhere near the more progressive end compared with those of many of her counterparts across the country. It would not be inaccurate to label her a centrist, at best, who at times acted more as a populist. In communities of color especially, there’s a tenuous understanding of the role prosecutors play in relation to overall public safety and community. I say that as a former prosecutor myself. Though Black people want and deserve to live in safe communities, there are legitimate questions as to what role — if any — law enforcement should and can play in bringing about that safety. We learned during President Barack Obama’s two terms in the Oval Office that a Black president, even when paired with a Black attorney general, does not mean the police will stop abusing and killing Black people. Whether it is a vigilante private citizen, as in the cases of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, or violence stemming directly from police, as in the cases of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Atiana Jefferson and countless others whose ultimately went free, that a Black man was in office did not matter.  So many Black people experienced violence at the hands of law enforcement during Obama’s presidency and Eric Holder’s time as the first Black U.S. attorney general, but they were generally powerless in terms of their ability to hold those offending police officers accountable. The easiest and lowest-hanging fruit for Harris on the issue of police violence is to commit to the abolition of qualified immunity. This is the legal doctrine that shields law enforcement from accountability for wrongdoing. If Harris were to prioritize getting rid of qualified immunity as the bedrock of her civil rights agenda, it would immediately quell much of the apprehension around her candidacy from a civil rights perspective. Likewise, this is the time for her to lean in, not only with her words but also with substantive policy measures, to her experience as a prosecutor in addressing real criminal justice reform, as well as reform around policing. It would also distinguish her from Trump, who has called for “absolute immunity” for police. Civil rights, fundamentally, is about access and the opening of doors. The blowback against DEI is, for example, at its core steeped in anti-Blackness but rooted in a pendulum swing away from civil rights. There are a host of issue areas in which Harris could seek to have influence under the banner of civil rights. A commitment to closing the achievement gap for Black boys is a civil rights issue in that a denial of equal access to quality educational opportunities is a violation of their federally protected civil rights. Likewise, access to the ballot is a civil right, and it is instructive that Harris has been vocal in this vein. Presidents are not lawmakers, but Harris ought to commit to using the insuperable power of the bully pulpit to apply pressure and influence policy. This is why an omission of substantive talking points around civil rights is glaring and unacceptable. While Harris can and should take a broad approach in setting forth an ambitious civil rights policy agenda, it’s imperative that she keep the main thing as the main thing and squarely address the issues of criminal justice reform, abolishing qualified immunity and eliminating police violence in America through substantive policy reform. This week she will be on the biggest stage with the brightest lights and the loudest microphone. For the sake of Sonya Massey and so many others, Harris, with so many watching and listening, must present a plan."

"Falling behind, Trump eyes personal attacks as a life-preserver",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 10:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-personal-attacks-election-2024-rcna167805,"It’s not exactly a secret that Republican officials are practically begging Donald Trump to steer clear of personal attacks and focus on substantive issues. It’s also plainly true that the former president doesn’t care for the advice. The results have been predictable: The GOP candidate has gone after Vice President Kamala Harris’ intellect, gender, laugh, family, appearance and race and ethnicity, among other things. At a long and meandering press conference last week, Trump went so far as to say he felt “entitled“ to go after his Democratic rival in personal ways. There’s little evidence to suggest these attacks are working. The former president has even complained publicly that he hasn’t quite figured out how to apply a nickname to Harris that’s stuck. But as a New York Times report noted, Republicans waiting for Trump to abandon the personal attacks and run as a serious candidate should probably give up. In remarks that were ostensibly about national security, the former president went after President Joe Biden, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama and Harris in personal ways. In fact, Trump used the opportunity to tell his followers that he believes the Democratic nominee is both “stupid” and a “Marxist or a communist.” Apparently trying to rationalize his strategy, the Republican acknowledged the behind-the-scenes advice he’s received. “They always say, ‘Sir, please stick to policy. Don’t get personal,’” Trump said. “And yet they’re getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?” On cue, the crowd responded, “No.” At the same event, the candidate polled his audience, which agreed with their applause that Trump should “get personal” against his opponents. It was at that point when he joked, “My advisers are fired.” The point, of course, isn’t that Trump is going to fire his campaign team. Rather, the point is that his rhetoric was a big hint about what’s to come. In fact, given the larger context, it’s likely that the former president doesn’t just want to engage in personal attacks — this is, after all, his comfort zone — he also thinks he has to engage in personal attacks. Polling suggests he’s falling behind Harris; the Democratic convention has gone quite well for the party thus far; and the GOP nominee is increasingly looking for an electoral life-preserver. As The New Republic’s Greg Sargent summarized, Trump genuinely seems to think that Harris’ surge in the polls “is somehow the result of him being constrained from going full gutter MAGA on her.” All of which suggests the American electorate should expect to see the Republican take the presidential race in an even uglier direction over the next 10 or so weeks."
DNC video highlights what the election means for holding people accountable for Jan. 6,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 10:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/dnc-january-6-video-trump-election-interference-rcna167787,"Donald Trump’s legal exposure is partly tied to his political success: Winning the presidential election is his best legal strategy for fighting his criminal cases. A haunting video shown at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Wednesday night was a stark reminder of what that means when it comes to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, both for Trump’s own criminal case and Jan. 6 defendants more broadly. The video, which spotlights the Trump-inspired violence of that day, runs just under four minutes and is worth watching: More than serving as a reminder (important in its own right), the video underscores how Trump, if elected, will be empowered not only to crush his own federal election interference case but to pardon the rioters he inspired to storm the Capitol. Specifically, it enumerated the four counts the GOP presidential nominee is charged with in his Washington, D.C., indictment: conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy against rights, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding. (Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrong-doing.) Now, I began this post by noting that Trump’s legal exposure is partly tied to his political success, because the Supreme Court has already given him a head start. In Trump v. United States last month, the Republican-appointed majority rendered at least some of Trump’s conduct immune from prosecution; the extent of that immunity is still being litigated and won’t likely be fully resolved before the election. In another Jan. 6–related ruling this past term, Fischer v. United States, the court narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants, which could affect the obstruction-related counts against Trump, too. As with the immunity issue, the extent to which it does so remains to be seen. So if Trump loses in November, it’s still an open question what will be left of his Jan. 6–related indictment. If he wins, we may never know the answer. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

That’s a question many Americans are rightly asking themselves since the vice president became our presumptive Democratic nominee. As the only member of Congress who’s worked for Kamala Harris, I can provide some insight. We’ve already seen Donald Trump’s record as president. He let the ultrawealthy off the hook for paying their fair share in taxes. He weakened our international alliances. He proposed cuts to Social Security. In a second Trump term, he would do all this again. The Biden-Harris administration has cracked down on tax cheats, restored our global standing and protected Social Security. Vice President Harris would continue this work, while bringing her own leadership style. We can look to her record of public service — a record I have observed up close — to see how she works for the people. Kamala Harris took office as California’s attorney general in 2011, during the long, painful aftermath of the Great Recession. At the time, attorneys general from 49 states were negotiating with the nation’s largest banks, demanding that these institutions take responsibility for their role in the foreclosure crisis. Kamala spent months pushing for a better deal, channeling the pain she’d heard from families on the campaign trail. When the banks refused to do enough, she pulled out of the talks, which threatened to derail the compromise because of California’s size. This angered the bankers. It annoyed other attorneys general, some of whom had been in office for decades. But it was the right thing for her constituents — and it worked. She got the banks to promise more than quadruple what they initially offered to help Californians. That’s someone who can’t be bought or bullied. Now, think about Kamala bringing this tenacity to a high-level international meeting like the G7. She won’t go along to get along; she’ll do what’s right for Americans and for a safer, more peaceful world. Kamala knows that respect is not something one can petulantly demand, as Trump does. Respect comes from the moral authority of doing what’s right and speaking truth to power. Kamala was savvy to press the big banks to do more, but her most remarkable insight guided her next move. She understood that the settlement depended on the banks’ promises to change their unlawful practices — and that given their illegal conduct, it wasn’t enough just to hope that they shaped up. For Kamala, the victory wasn’t the words on the pages of the National Mortgage Settlement or the press conference announcing the deal. Families were counting on government to deliver actual help that improved their lives. Over objections from the big banks, Kamala appointed me as an independent watchdog for the settlement. She empowered me to hold the banks’ feet to the fire and to get results for Californians. I had no formal legal authority, but I had Kamala’s force of will behind me. With her backing, we halted hundreds of foreclosures and forced the banks to consider families for loan modifications. We were able to get one family a six-figure compensation check from one major bank for its flawed processes. We caught another major bank forcing consumers to sign away their right to sue for legal violations —breaking a promise it had made in the settlement — and we forced it to send out hundreds of thousands of correction letters. We successfully pressed the banks to work more to reach the hardest-hit communities, and we held workshops for service members and seniors. We changed lives on the ground. That’s how Kamala is: She sees things through, not stopping until people get help, because she cares about our families. When she called me to offer me the job as California monitor, I had a 2-month-old. Like many working moms, I had to bring my infant to work because she had nowhere else to go. I remember being embarrassed on the call, worrying if Betsy would cry or fuss while I was talking to the attorney general. I nervously confessed that I had my baby with me. Kamala didn’t hesitate. She asked how my baby and I were doing and how her siblings were adjusting. She wasn’t making small talk; she genuinely wanted to know. And then she continued to tell me about how important it was that Californians have a watchdog and a place to report any continued bank misconduct. I had a newborn, two other kids and a full-time job as a college professor. Kamala did not even blink; she expressed confidence in me to do the job and emphasized the importance of the work. This is how I know, very personally, that Americans can count on Kamala to fill her administration with the best, most qualified leaders from all walks of life to advocate for everyday Americans. There couldn’t be a clearer contrast with Donald Trump. As I exposed in congressional hearings, his appointees included a housing secretary who didn’t know basic real estate terms and a postmaster general who didn’t know how much it costs to mail a postcard. I can assure Americans from personal experience: Kamala Harris’ vision for moving America forward will not just be words on a convention stage or at a press conference. Nor will it be the empty promises and lip service that we hear from too many politicians who pose as leaders. Kamala will do what’s right and go to the mat to get it done."
Trump pushes unconstitutional punishment for flag-burning at DNC protests,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-punishment-dnc-protests-rcna167749,"While Democrats seek to reclaim the mantle of “freedom” from Republicans this election season, the GOP’s presidential nominee pushed for an unconstitutional punishment for those who exercise their freedom in a way he dislikes — that is, by burning the American flag.  Citing such behavior by protesters outside the Israeli consulate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, Donald Trump called for Congress to pass a law mandating a year in jail for anyone who protests in that manner.  The legal problem with that proposal is that it violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court addressed the issue in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson, when conservative icon Antonin Scalia joined the high court majority in deciding that a conviction for burning the flag was unconstitutional. This isn’t the first time that the former president has advocated for such an unconstitutional punishment. Just last month, Trump did so after people burned flags while protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Washington, D.C., congressional address. And in 2016, as president-elect, he suggested that flag-burners be stripped of their citizenship. It’s unsurprising that the man who flouted his constitutional oath the first time around should lack the understanding, appreciation or both of the law and the freedoms it secures.

Trump targets Shapiro as a ‘highly overrated Jewish Governor’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:14 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-shapiro-highly-overrated-jewish-governor-rcna167780,"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention were very well received, though Donald Trump was apparently unimpressed. The Wall Street Journal reported: Even for Trump, who peddles antisemitic tropes as a matter of course, this was bizarre. In a middle-of-the-night tirade, the GOP candidate began by arguing, “The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech.” Whether Trump understands this or not, the fact that he emphasized the governor’s faith was itself emblematic of his prejudice: When the former president lashes out at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he doesn’t call him a “highly overrated Lutheran governor.” When Trump whines about House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, he doesn’t call her a “highly overrated Catholic congresswoman.” But when targeting Shapiro, the Republican apparently finds it necessary to call out the governor’s religion — which says quite a bit about Trump, and none of it’s good. In the same online missive, Trump added, “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close.” In other words, as far as the GOP candidate is concerned, in the history of Israel, no other human being — in the United States or abroad — has ever done more for the country than him, which is unintentionally hilarious. In case that weren’t quite enough, the former president went on to say that Vice President Kamala Harris “hates Israel and will do nothing but make its journey through the complexities of survival as difficult as possible, hoping in the end that it will fail.” To the extent that reality still has any meaning, there’s literally no evidence of the Democratic presidential hopeful “hating” Israel, but this sentence stood out for me for an entirely different reason: While Trump habitually publishes angry screeds to his social media platform in the middle of the night, it’s difficult to believe that it was his hands that wrote that Israel is making “its journey through the complexities of survival.” In other words, Trump didn’t just peddle offensive nonsense, he also might’ve had some help putting this one together. For a politician who’s a little too eager to falsely accuse his opponents of antisemitism, this was ridiculous. Indeed, Trump's rhetoric was so ugly that a White House spokesperson condemned his missive, saying, “It is Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” Shapiro himself wasn't impressed with Trump's nonsense, either. “I mean, first off, I think it’s clear over the last few years, Donald Trump is obsessed with me and obsessed with continuing to spew hate and division in our politics,"" the governor said. ""He’s someone who has routinely peddled antisemitic tropes like this. Look, remember, he’s the guy who wanted Doug Mastriano to have his job. He’s the guy who has been repeatedly rejected by the voters of Pennsylvania. He himself lost in 2020, all of his handpicked candidates have lost, and I think he’s heading for another loss — this time to Kamala Harris. ""I think you all heard me talk last night at the DNC — the exact polar opposite of what Donald Trump is talking about. I’m talking about real freedom, bringing people together, accepting folks no matter what they look like, where they come from, who they love, who they pray to and saying, 'This is a place for you.' That’s diametrically opposed to everything Donald Trump believes, and it’s clear that he’s going to continue to be the hateful, divisive person that he’s always been in this campaign. And I think given his track record, it’s clear he’s setting himself up for another defeat.”"
"Why Trump pointed to a made-up meeting between Harris, Putin",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 7:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pointed-made-meeting-harris-putin-rcna167762,"Almost immediately after Russia’s Vladimir Putin launched an invasion into Ukraine, Donald Trump has tried to blame the war on the Biden administration. The line has never made sense — even John Bolton, Trump’s former White House national security advisor, didn’t buy it — but the former president has peddled the line in recent years anyway. In a speech in North Carolina devoted to national security, however, the Republican added a new chapter to his weird story. This was the anecdote the GOP candidate shared with supporters: At that point, Trump turned to retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and asked, “Did you know that, general?” Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Cameras didn’t capture Kellogg’s response, but I have a hunch he wasn’t familiar the story about the Harris-Putin meeting — because it only happened in Trump’s overactive imagination. Let’s briefly review a handful of pertinent details. First, Trump still doesn’t pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris’ name correctly. Second, Harris didn’t meet with Putin ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Trump, whose relationship with reality is often fractured, appears to have simply made this up. Third, the Democratic vice president, shortly before the war began, did attend the 2022 Munich Security Conference, representing the Biden administration. Trump would apparently have people believe that the vice president’s efforts were somehow a failure, but reality suggests otherwise: Harris met with officials from U.S. allies — not with Russia’s authoritarian leader — and helped solidify the Western alliance, which has been steadfast in its opposition to Moscow’s aggression. And finally, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that if anyone should avoid talking about private and undisclosed chats with Putin, it’s the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Remember this Politico report from June 2019? Months earlier, The Washington Post reported that Trump went to “extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations” with the Russian autocrat — at one point even “taking possession” of his own interpreter’s notes after a conversation with Putin. It’s a dynamic, in other words, in which Trump has to make up an imaginary conversation between Harris and Putin, while Democrats can reference actual conversations between Trump and Putin."
Trump’s odd pitch: ‘Our primary focus is not to get out the vote’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-primary-focus-not-get-out-vote-election-2024-rcna167743,"Election Day 2024 is still 11 weeks away, which might seem like a long while, but early voting in some states will begin in less than a month. Common sense suggests the major party presidential nominees would be laser focused right now on get-out-the-vote strategies and pursuing as many votes as possible. Indeed, it’s how democracies work: The more votes a campaign gets, the greater the chance of success. With this in mind, it’s curious to see Donald Trump consistently downplay the need for votes as part of his Republican candidacy. NBC News reported: “We have all the votes we’ll need,” Trump added, pointing to yard signs as proof of his popularity. As a video excerpt of his remarks made clear, the former president wasn’t kidding. I’ve studied campaigns for quite a while, and I honestly can’t think of another example in which a candidate, less than a month before voters start casting ballots in a competitive race, said out loud, “Our primary focus is not to get out the vote.” If the message sounds familiar, it’s not your imagination. As we discussed roughly a month ago, the GOP candidate peddled the same line on Fox News in late July. “My instruction: We don’t need the votes, I have so many votes,” Trump said. It wasn’t a mistake. The day after June’s presidential debate, for example, the former president held a rally in Virginia and told attendees, “We don’t need votes.” A week earlier, the Republican spoke at a far-right conference and said roughly the same thing. “I tell my people, I don’t need any votes,” said Trump, who added: “We don’t need the votes.” That came on heels of the GOP candidate pushing the same line during an appearance in Detroit. “Listen, we don’t need votes,” Trump said. He added: “We don’t need votes. We have to stop — focus, don’t worry about votes.” In fact, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the former president has been pushing this line since last fall, during his party’s primary process. “You don’t have to vote,” Trump told a New Hampshire audience in October. “Don’t worry about voting. The voting — we got plenty of votes.” As best as I can tell, Trump isn’t literally telling Americans not to cast ballots. He’s instead suggesting that he’s so wildly popular, receiving support from voters will be effortless as Election Day nears. The real challenge, the former president invariably adds, is dealing with cheating and electoral fraud that definitely exist in his weird imagination, despite Trump’s inability to substantiate his conspiracy theories with evidence. In other words, every time the Republican downplays the need for votes, he’s necessarily emphasizing the need for voter intimidation tactics and voting restrictions. Given the volume and repetition of his anti-election rhetoric — Trump asked earlier this week, “Why are we having an election?” — and after his years long antipathy toward democracy, it’s tough not to find the comments unsettling. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Walz, Democrats claim the mantle of ‘freedom’ at convention",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 5:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/walz-democrats-claim-mantle-freedom-convention-rcna167734,"Republicans haven’t exactly been subtle in claiming the idea of “freedom” as their own. When a group of right-wing GOP House members decided to create their own radical faction, for example, they called it the House Freedom Caucus. When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was preparing to launch an ill-fated national campaign, he labeled his state “a citadel of freedom,” “freedom’s linchpin” and “freedom’s vanguard.” He went on to title his memoir “The Courage to Be Free” and called his budget a “Framework for Freedom.” But if “freedom” is a word that Republicans stole from Democrats, the Harris/Walz campaign and its allies are stealing it back. In fact, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted his party’s vice presidential nomination, he explicitly said that “freedom” is “what this election is about.” From the transcript: The Minnesotan was hardly alone. Earlier in the evening, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro emphasized a similar message, explaining Donald Trump “cloaks himself in the blanket of freedom, what he’s offering isn’t freedom at all.” “It’s not freedom to tell our children what books they’re allowed to read,” he added. “And it’s not freedom to tell women what they can do with their bodies. It sure as hell isn’t freedom to say, ‘You can go vote, but he gets to pick the winner.’ That’s not freedom.” Soon after, convention attendees were presented with a new video from the Harris campaign. It’s title: “We believe in freedom.” It dovetails with a convention in which Beyonce’s “Freedom” has been a musical mainstay of the entire event, and as Walz ended his convention remarks, it was Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” that played over the loudspeakers. All of which is to say, Democrats aren’t just trying to change the public conversation, they’re also picking a fight over the mantle of “freedom” itself. As the ongoing convention is helping prove, it’s a fight the party thinks it can win."
Tim Walz’s communal patriotism is a striking contrast to Trump's individualism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 5:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walzs-dnc-speech-was-powerfully-patriotic-sincere-rcna167373,"“We’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason — we love this country,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at the beginning of his convention speech Wednesday night. He clearly means it — it turns out you can be a skilled politician carrying out a strategy to win an election and also be sincere. In his speech, Walz showed why he offers Democrats an opportunity to reclaim patriotism, and perhaps help redefine it along the way.  For as long as I’ve been writing about politics, I’ve argued against the idea that some of us are “real” Americans and the rest of us are something else, or that some American places are more American than others. Those are pernicious ideas in a country as large and varied as ours, and one built on its ability to constantly remake and renew itself. But let’s be honest: If we put a thousand voters in a mind-reading machine and asked them to picture a “patriotic American,” certain kinds of people would come to mind. They’d look more like Walz than Vice President Kamala Harris: rural rather than urban, from the country’s middle rather than the coasts, male rather than female, and yes, probably white.  Problematic as it might be, the fact that Walz “codes” as the kind of person you just know has a flag flying from their porch means that when he talks about patriotism, he might be able to convince some people who haven’t been too open to Democrats to listen. Which is why Walz’s framing of patriotism as community is so important.  The Harris campaign has put the word “freedom” at the heart of its campaign, and Walz even sometimes describes the campaign ethos as “mind your own damn business.” But he also talks frequently about the nation as a web of commitments and obligations of care. “The family down the road — they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do, they may not love like you do, but they’re your neighbors. And you look out for them, just like they do for you,” he said in his speech. “Everybody belongs, and everybody has a responsibility to contribute.” It’s a striking contrast with the Republican ticket, whose understanding of patriotism doesn’t have much to do with neighborliness. Walz’s counterpart, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said in his convention speech that “the source of American greatness” can be found where his family is from in Kentucky, not because it represents American ideals, but because it “is our homeland. People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home.” But Vance doesn’t have much to say about what it means to live in that home. The contrast is even more stark when we consider what Donald Trump has to say about patriotism. He has a schtick he does in which he literally hugs and kisses an American flag, which always gets a laugh from the MAGA faithful. It’s supposed to communicate that he loves his country but his brand of patriotism is utterly hollow. America is our team, we hate all the other teams, and that’s about as deep as it goes. Trump substitutes nationalism for patriotism, insisting that love for America is found in fear and animosity toward the rest of the world.   Think about it this way: What exactly is it about America that Donald Trump loves? Have we ever heard him speak about the extraordinary diversity of our places and people, or our amazing achievements in science and culture, or the majesty of our national parks? Of course not. If you asked him why it is that people across the world dream of coming here, his only answer would be that we have to keep them out.  And when he isn’t in power, he can’t help but describe the country in ways that drip with contempt. As far as Trump’s concerned, this is a land of mayhem and misery, full of losers and suckers who are worthy of nothing but scorn. And he has a particular affection for those who committed treason against America so they could keep other Americans enslaved. That Trump can say the things he does and still claim to be patriotic only reminds liberals of how long they have been targeted with accusations of insufficient patriotism. It was particularly acute in the years following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and into the Iraq War, when anyone who raised questions about the unfolding disaster of American foreign policy was liable to be told they hated America and were siding with “the terrorists.”  Which makes it all the more heartening to see an all-American guy like Tim Walz make a plea for a different kind of patriotism. At the end of his speech, Walz implored Democrats to work hard in the remaining time before the election. “That’s how we make America a place where no child is left hungry,” he said. “Where no community is left behind. Where nobody gets told they don’t belong.” If he and Harris keep emphasizing that this vision of inclusiveness, care and common fate is at the heart of patriotism, they might just convince a few people that it’s about more than whether you hug a flag."
Kamala Harris made me feel seen when no one else looked,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-made-feel-seen-no-one-else-looked-rcna167341,"My wife Diana and I met Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff in the summer of 2015, when Harris and I were both preparing to run for Senate. And by preparing to run, I mean traveling the country fundraising, because the amount of money it takes to run for the U.S. Senate requires you to spend more than a year flying around gathering up cash, like a marathoner accepting little cups of water from strangers. Harris won her Senate race and I got a silver medal in mine, but we stayed in touch and I would visit her sometimes during trips to D.C. We were friends, but not super close, which is common for friendships in politics.  Despite losing that Senate race, my political profile continued to grow and for a time I was among the couple of dozen Democrats preparing to make a 2020 run for the presidency. But in the latter half of 2018, I dropped out of the 2020 presidential mix, and then out of public life for a while, to go to the VA to seek therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. I’d been putting it off since serving in Afghanistan with the Army over a decade earlier, and it caught up to me rather abruptly.  Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Just like that, I went from what the political world cynically calls a “bold faced name” to a vet with no job other than growing a beard, going to therapy, and trying to learn how to be useful around the house. When I first made the announcement, it seemed like everybody I knew, famous or otherwise, reached out. But after a while, most of those calls tapered off as people went on with their lives and I disappeared from their televisions and their social media feeds. Kamala Harris was one in a small group of people in the political world who continued to call. In fact, she checked in on me with some regularity. She would sometimes call just to catch up, or sometimes she had a big speech or meeting coming up with a veterans’ or national security group and I’d be a sounding board. I don’t know how much she actually needed my advice about that stuff when she asked for it, and I don’t know how much I helped, but her asking made me feel valuable at a time when I’d sort of given the world permission to forget about me. And I appreciated that gesture a lot.   I remember answering her call one day while pushing a cart through Costco. This was well after she was headlong into the 2020 campaign, and she had her veterans' policy person on the line because she wanted to run some language by me. Once that was done, she thanked that person and then politely asked that they go ahead and drop off the line so we could catch up.   As usual, she expressed genuine interest in how my mental health was coming along. By that point I was truly into a post-traumatic growth chapter and had moved on to a role as an executive at a national veterans nonprofit. At some point, I mentioned that I was thinking about doing some TV surrogate stuff for the campaign. It was kind of a big-deal decision for me at the time because I’d been out of the mix for almost two years by then.   She was clearly excited for me, because she spent a couple minutes describing in great detail how to set up my home office to make cable hits easy and comfortable. I still use the ring light she suggested.   My point in sharing this admittedly uneventful and humdrum anecdote is that I’m excited about the prospect of a Kamala Harris presidency not just because she’s brilliant and skilled and hardworking and believes in the right things. I’m also excited because, in my experience, she’s a downright decent person who shows people respect and makes sure they feel seen. And I’m not trying to do some humblebrag “I’m friends with the next president” flex here because I’ll be the first to tell you we’re not close friends. At best, we’re friendly acquaintances who used to work in the same field. And that’s my point. She is the type of person who is thoughtful enough to treat a peer like a peer, even when that person has bowed out and is no longer really a peer at all. And that’s the kind of everyday decency I believe she’ll bring to the presidency. "
The Republican attack on Tim Walz over Tiananmen Square is almost unbelievable,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-china-trip-tiananmen-ron-johnson-rcna167552,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s meteoric rise and his aptitude for putting down Republicans is driving the GOP crazy and has it scrambling desperately to find comebacks. By far the funniest attempt to take down Walz has come from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.  In an interview this week with Fox Business, Johnson warned that Walz is a “radical leftist” and made the case by pointing out what he called Walz’s “strange” relationship with China. “He got married on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square. He’s gone to China. He’s taught in China. He’s got deep connections to China,” Johnson said in the interview. I had to listen to the interview twice to make sure I wasn’t mishearing it, because I couldn’t believe Johnson had pointed to Walz’s remembrance of the Tiananmen Square massacre as evidence that he could be some kind of Manchurian candidate. Johnson seems unaware that he scored an own goal. Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Johnson is right about the basic fact: Walz did choose the date of the incident for his marriage. But the 1989 incident, during which Chinese troops opened fire on and killed hundreds — possibly thousands — of peaceful protesters in Beijing who were calling for political reforms, is an event that the Chinese Communist Party loathes anybody mentioning. The government has aggressively sought to suppress information about the protests and the Communist Party’s crackdown in China; even so, the event remains one of the most iconic reference points for human rights criticism of Beijing. Walz has said the date “will always have a lot of bitter memories for the people”; his choice to make it the date of his wedding anniversary is clearly an homage to the victims. Walz’s act of remembrance is an act of rebellion against the Chinese government’s agenda to conceal its murderous repression. In other words, Johnson, a China hawk like most members of his party, ought to be encouraged by Walz’s symbolic gesture, not suspicious of it. Either he’s illiterate about Chinese history or he’s just throwing anything at the wall to see what’ll stick. Maybe it’s both. The GOP has gone all in trying to peddle conspiracy theories that Walz’s many trips to China — first to teach English, and then as a teacher escorting American students on cultural exchange visits — have compromised him somehow. House Republicans are investigating Walz for ties to China, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has hysterically accused Walz of having been covertly co-opted by China, posting on X that Walz is an example of how “Beijing patiently grooms future American leaders.” But, again, the GOP has gotten everything exactly upside down. Walz’s background and record on China are not liabilities but strengths. There’s nothing known about Walz’s trips there that suggest anything unseemly. His comments on the record — many of which were documented in local papers long before he expressed any political ambitions — show that he has consistently expressed affection for the Chinese people and criticism of their government. “If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what [Chinese people] could accomplish,” he told the Alliance Star-Herald in Nebraska in 1990. Walz also speaks Mandarin. This kind of background is not a warning sign. It’s reflective of the kind of cosmopolitan, critically engaged sensibility one wants in a politician who can influence international affairs. As my colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim has pointed out, Walz’s congressional record suggests he’s far from a pushover when it comes to pointing out China’s problems: Walz also opposes China’s expansion in the South China Sea but has expressed optimism about “areas of cooperation that we can work on,” and believes the U.S.-Chinese relationship doesn't necessarily need ""to be an adversarial relationship.” As Paul Musgrave, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, puts it, Walz’s record is “that of a measured critic of the Chinese Communist Party—prone neither to exaggeration nor accommodation.” In Musgrave's assessment, Walz is a moderate who defies the categories of ""hawk"" and ""dove"" on China, and approaches the issue as ""a student and a teacher."" Republicans, frantic to find a vulnerability in Walz’s armor as an affable happy warrior from the Midwest, have decided that his China affiliations are a path to taking him down. But the more one learns about those affiliations, the more one realizes that it’s a good thing that someone with his background could soon become the vice president. "
Oprah Winfrey’s DNC speech was a surprise masterclass in patriotism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/oprah-winfrey-dnc-speech-democratic-convention-rcna167688,"Who better to bring home the meaning of E Pluribus Unum than Oprah? The one-name wonder is her own economic force, a woman who can move company stock prices simply by placing car keys under chairs or mentioning a book title or creating a Christmas list.  At the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, back in her hometown of Chicago, Oprah tried to move the American public toward unity in democracy. She spoke about the people who seek to rule, “who seek to divide and then conquer.” Her advice to us wasn’t the pablum we hear about rugged individualism and raising yourself up by your bootstraps. She told us that we are neighbors — and we don’t ask if our neighbors have citizenship or if they married the way we think they should be or if they are “childless cat ladies.” When the house is on fire, we go ahead and rescue the cat, too. Oprah quoted the late, great Congressman John Lewis — “no matter what ship our ancestors arrived on, we are all in the same boat now.” And she hammered that point home by connecting our power to vote our values, that “democracy and respect are the ballot.” Democrats, Never Trumpers and experts on authoritarianism have tried for the entire Trump era to warn the American people that the entire American experiment is at stake. While polls show Americans are broadly worried about threats to our democracy, democracy as an issue barely appears on lists of voter priorities this election. This is what made Oprah’s surprise DNC appearance so valuable: She has claimed her pride in being American, and in her only-Oprah-can-do-it way, she made the Constitution relatable and real again. Her storytelling, charisma and sense of optimism are her superpowers in her role of healer-in-chief. Her message is simple: The choice in November is to choose loyalty to the Constitution, rather than loyalty to any individual.

Tim Walz’s Midwestern dad energy is hard to miss. Memes and social media posts — some silly, some earnest — have proliferated as online progressives celebrate “America’s dad.” Walz reminds me of my dad, too. But in a different way.  Walz has spoken candidly about his family’s experience with assisted reproductive technologies, more commonly known as fertility treatments. Walz and his wife, Gwen, had their daughter, Hope, through intrauterine insemination (IUI) in 2001, after seven years of trying to have children. (Although Walz has sometimes used “IVF” as a catch-all term to refer to the fertility treatments his family went through, IUI is less invasive and less expensive than IVF, and it is often a first option for families struggling to conceive.)  Since 1978, over 10 million children globally are believed to have been born as a result of assisted reproductive technologies, according to the National Institutes of Health. I am one of those 10 million, as is my brother. When my parents got married in 1996, they knew they wanted to start a family. When they had trouble conceiving naturally, they decided to pursue fertility treatments. They started with IUI and then tried IVF. They were devastated when the first treatments failed. But after the second round of IVF, they were pregnant — with twins. My brother and I arrived in August 2000. We wouldn’t exist without IVF. And when I hear Walz speak about the importance of access to fertility treatment, it reminds me of my own parents.  My dad is the most emotive person I know. He’s never been the stoic macho type. In fact, when I called him to check some facts for this essay, he cried. I see the same raw emotion from Walz. “I’m not crying, you’re crying,” Walz said at an Arizona rally after the crowd began chanting his daughter’s name.  My parents describe their IVF experience as deeply trying, even as it led to the ultimate reward. And they’ve always expressed gratitude for the science that gave them their family.  As a teenager, I would joke about being a “test tube baby” and a GMO. But, deep down, I took pride in it, knowing the lengths my parents went to start their family. The method of our conception was never hidden from us — it was a part of our family’s story.  Those who have gone through fertility treatments like IVF share a special connection. Gwen Walz has spoken about the community assistance she received during her fertility process, sharing recently about a neighbor who assisted her with her IUI treatments. When my parents were going through the process, my mom developed a similar community of women at her doctor’s appointments and on an early internet message board. They shared the highs and lows, the ups and downs. And when my mom became pregnant, she gave her unused medicine, worth over $2,000, to another woman struggling to pay for the treatments.   “Having this community of women was a lifeline for me,” my mom told me. “It was so validating to share my feelings and know others were feeling the same way. I didn’t know them well, but I felt like we were really close friends because we were going through such an intense experience together.”  Walz is talking about fertility treatments on the campaign trail for a reason: IVF in particular is under attack by some conservatives. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally considered children, forcing many reproductive clinics to halt treatment in fear of legal challenges. And while most Republicans haven’t publicly endorsed an IVF ban, over 100 Republicans in Congress signed the Life at Conception Act, which claims legal protections for human beings should begin at “the moment of fertilization.” After the Alabama ruling, Walz posted on Facebook: “Gwen and I have two beautiful children because of reproductive health care like IVF. This issue is deeply personal to our family and so many others. Don’t let these guys get away with this by telling you they support IVF when their handpicked judges oppose it. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions are clear. They’re bringing anti-science government into your exam room, bedroom, and classroom.” Walz calls out their hypocrisy for what it is. How can a party that claims to believe in the sanctity of the family deny someone who wants a child? That’s another part of my father that I see in Walz — a sense of righteous anger about what he deems to be unjust and cruel. Walz is reminding voters that reproductive rights are a men’s issue, too, as Faith Hill wrote in The Atlantic. But the way he speaks about this topic matters, too. He’s demonstrating a kind of masculinity that couldn’t be more different from the Trump-Vance machismo brand. Hope Walz and I may not have much in common, life-wise. But we both have parents who went to great lengths to achieve their dream of starting a family. And there are hundreds of thousands of Americans, like Hope and me, born through assisted reproductive technologies. We all see a piece of our own families in Tim Walz. And Walz carries a piece of all of us in his and Kamala Harris’ fight for reproductive rights."
Eric Holder takes MSNBC inside Kamala Harris' VP vetting process,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 4:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/eric-holder-vice-president-barack-obama-tim-walz-rcna167641,"Former Attorney General Eric Holder sat down with MSNBC's Symone Sanders-Townsend for his first interview since he was selected to lead Vice President Kamala Harris' vice presidential vetting process. Wednesday's interview was part of an MSNBC Live event at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Holder joined two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, MSNBC Live co-host and creative director Luke Russert, and co-host of ""The Weekend"" Symone Sanders-Townsend for a conversation focused on voting and the 2024 election. Holder pulled back the curtain on Harris' vetting process and explained how it compared to his previous experience screening running mates for former President Barack Obama in 2008: ""We had about two and a half, three months to do that. This one took 15 days."" Holder said he convened a team of about 70 lawyers from his firm, Covington & Burling, to help with the effort. According to the former attorney general, they worked around the clock, whittling down a list of about 11 candidates to Harris' final pick, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Holder said his team's research involved watching hours of videos of the candidates, telling Sanders-Townsend he looked at more videos than he's ever seen in his life. ""My YouTube hours are off the charts now,"" he said. Holder admitted there were some positives about the accelerated timeline. ""It was daunting, but the time was so short that you didn’t have time to get too anxious about it,"" he said. ""It was only at the conclusion that you said, 'I hope we got everything.' And I think we did."" Holder said it helped that Harris had ""the great ability to pick from a wide range of really qualified people."" When asked why the governor ultimately got the job, Holder explained it came down to Walz's accomplishments and his chemistry with Harris. He said the pair ""just kind of clicked."" As for his experience, Holder ticked through the governor's resume, noting his time in the military, in Congress and his tenure as a teacher. In the end, Holder said he was confident Walz would be ""a great vice president."" During the conversation, Sanders-Townsend also asked the former attorney general about rumors he could join a possible Harris administration as her chief of staff. But Holder quickly shut the speculation down, ""I’ve had a good career in government and I'm pretty satisfied with the things I've done."" He then promised to do everything in his power to ""make sure that, in fact, Kamala Harris will pick a White House chief of staff."""
"RFK Jr. plans to drop bid for president and endorse Trump, sources tell NBC News",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 2:24 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 21, 2024, 3:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-to-drop-presidential-race-trump-rcna167602,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a scion of the Kennedy political dynasty whose independent presidential bid was bankrolled by his running mate and dogged by humiliating personal revelations, will drop out of the race and endorse Donald Trump for president, NBC News reports. Two sources familiar with the plans told NBC News that talks between the two campaigns are underway. Kennedy announced earlier that he will hold a news conference in Phoenix on Friday. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally outside Phoenix the same day. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told NBC News on Wednesday that there has been “a lot of communication back and forth” between Kennedy and the GOP campaign. The end of Kennedy’s bid for president, culminating in an endorsement for Trump, is not entirely unexpected. His running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said in a podcast interview released Tuesday that their campaign was considering exiting the race to help Trump. Later that day, Trump said he would be open to offering Kennedy a role in his administration, though Vance separately suggested that a potential Cabinet position would not be contingent on Kennedy backing the former president. Despite his long odds from the outset, Kennedy had worked hard to be seen as a serious contender. He fought to get his name on state ballots (though his methods have drawn scrutiny) and to appear onstage at the June debate. To voters unhappy with the major-party options, he pitched himself as a leader who would reject corporate influence on politics, a position buttressed by his conspiratorial view of the world. Yet his campaign never really took off. He consistently flailed in the polls and struggled to raise money, relying heavily on Shanahan, a philanthropist and former Silicon Valley lawyer, to fund his campaign. His political agenda also had little impact: As a third-party contender, he put forward a platform that was too haphazard for him to be a movement candidate, and his campaign was too weak for him to be a spoiler. What Kennedy’s candidacy did do was raise his national profile — and deeply damage his already questionable reputation in the public eye. His conspiracy beliefs gained intense scrutiny, and he was publicly snubbed by other Kennedys, with 15 of his family members — including six of his 10 siblings — publicly endorsing Joe Biden before the president dropped out. There were also a series of disturbing disclosures from his past. Kennedy told The New York Times that he had bounced back from the cognitive effects of a parasitic worm eating part of his brain. After a woman who used to babysit his children accused him of sexual assault, saying he had groped her and touched her inappropriately on separate occasions, Kennedy said in response: “I am who I am.” Asked by The Boston Globe whether more women would come forward with sexual misconduct allegations, he said: “We’ll see what happens.” Kennedy also had to deny to Vanity Fair that he once ate a dog and, most recently, revealed that he once dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park as a bizarre joke."
Here’s how Democrats have changed since the Bill Clinton era,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 2:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democratic-party-dnc-bill-clinton-era-changes-rcna166669,"It was a different electorate when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton accepted his party’s nomination on behalf of the forgotten middle class in 1992. There was no Blue Wall. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voted red. Democrats had lost three straight presidential elections. The electorate was 88% white, and there weren’t enough Hispanics voting to even show up in the exit polls. “I am a product of America’s middle class. And when I am your president, you will be forgotten no more,” Clinton said to thunderous applause. He wasn’t expected to win against President George H.W. Bush, a Greatest Generation decorated veteran. America’s love for youth and change carried Clinton and Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee, two baby boomers from the South, to the White House. When Clinton addresses the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, it will be with the expectation that another unlikely standard-bearer will be victorious, because Vice President Kamala Harris represents the America of today and the future just as Clinton did in his time. In the three decades since Clinton was first elected, enormous demographic and culture shifts have taken place that dictate how campaigns are run and where they find their voters.  Still, one thing remains true: “What you stand for really matters,” says Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which helped Clinton hone his message to win back working-class white voters, dubbed Reagan Democrats. The Rev. Jesse Jackson mocked the DLC as “Democrats for the Leisure Class” for defying liberal orthodoxy with a pro-business, trade-friendly agenda and, on cultural issues, promising to “end welfare as we know it” and put 100,000 cops on the streets, policies that addressed the anxieties of the 1980s and ’90s.   When Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020, the electorate was 20 points less white than in the Clinton era. Diverse groups are the core of the party’s support. Yet a central focus of the Harris-Walz ticket is to reach those same white voters without college degrees whom the DLC identified in 1992. Harris needs to win enough of their votes to get close to where Biden was with this group in 2020.  Clinton left office with a 66% approval rating after having created almost 23 million jobs and left a budget surplus that his successor, Bush, blew through with tax cuts for the rich. Clinton’s policies created a dream economy, but not everybody benefited, which led in part to the populist uprising we see today that is fueled by the resentments of those left behind. “It’s hard to make judgments about the validity of policy when you’re assessing it against a reality that’s 30 years later,” From told me. “We set an agenda for the 1990s. It wasn’t an agenda for 2020.” Trade was a big part of Clinton’s message, and it meant taking on the unions. Ross Perot, the populist billionaire from Texas, had warned during the 1992 presidential campaign that free trade would create a “giant sucking sound” as American manufacturing jobs fled across the border to Mexico. And in 1993, Perot and Vice President Al Gore held a joint TV appearance to debate the merits of NAFTA — the free-trade agreement Clinton negotiated. Clinton championed Most Favored Nation trading access for China, comparing its historic significance to President Richard Nixon’s opening of China. The glow faded when China flooded markets with cheap exports, and if there’s one thing that Democrats and Republicans agree on today, it is the threat that China’s trade practices pose to markets and the global economy. “It is a legitimate criticism that the people designing the Clinton program ... we didn’t see how serious the impact would be on non-college workers,” says Robert Shapiro, who was Clinton’s principal economic adviser during the ’92 campaign. Trade wasn’t the only culprit. “Most of the jobs lost were not to trade but technology, but the number of workers fell sharply.”  The ’90s were sharply partisan, with Republican rabble-rouser Newt Gingrich ascending to speaker of the House and cultural issues getting more weaponized. During the 1992 campaign, Clinton had responded “yes” to a question about gays’ serving in the military. The issue took on an energy all its own and consumed much of the early months of his presidency. Opposed were the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sam Nunn, the Democratic senator from Georgia who chaired the powerful Armed Services Committee. Faced with their firepower, Clinton backed down, signing compromise legislation dubbed “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which allowed gay people in the military if they followed a code of silence. It wasn’t something Clinton was proud of, and he would compound his anger and embarrassment when, in 1996, in the middle of his re-election campaign, he reluctantly signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had passed both chambers of Congress with big bipartisan majorities. To signal his displeasure, he signed the bill alone in the White House after midnight on a Friday with no cameras present. Clinton did what he had to as a politician navigating an intensifying conservative climate that would challenge the country. The Senate repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell” in 2010. The Supreme Court struck down DOMA in 2013 in a 5-4 ruling. The cultural issue that today’s Republicans are wielding is transgender rights. So far, Gov. Tim Walz has the best response: “Mind your own damn business.” Clinton might have something to say about that, too. He was, after all, impeached by the Gingrich-led House. The Republican-led Senate couldn’t even muster a majority, much less the two-thirds required to convict Clinton for what most Americans viewed as a personal matter. Five Republicans joined all 45 Democrats to acquit Clinton.  Clinton carried Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 1992 and 1996, elevating them to the Blue Wall status they enjoy today. It was an extraordinary feat at the time, since conventional wisdom held that the GOP had a lock on the Electoral College. “We didn’t break the lock; we picked it,” Clinton strategist James Carville said at the time. The imbalance has only grown, with the candidate who wins the popular vote not assured of prevailing in the Electoral College. Clinton and Gore harnessed the energy of their generation just as Harris and Walz (both technically baby boomers — but just barely) must inspire and motivate the generations that follow to win against these built-in structural odds."

I worked in Trump’s White House. Here’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/former-trump-white-house-staffer-olivia-troye-voting-kamala-harris-rcna167352,"I am a lifelong Republican who worked in the Trump White House, and the truth is that I’d rather be backing a candidate from my own party for president. But, for voters who care about preserving our democracy, our freedoms and opportunities, and our country’s standing around the world, there’s only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.  I left the Trump White House in August 2020 because I saw the danger Donald Trump posed for our country. This year, I joined Republicans for Harris, a coalition that gives voice to the millions of Republicans like me and independent voters who continue to reject the extremism and division of Trump. Trump weakened our standing on the world stage, damaged our institutions at home, and restricted our freedoms. He endangers our allies, says he’d allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to “do whatever the hell” he wants to them, and has threatened to withdraw the United States from NATO.  After losing in 2020, Trump tried to overturn a free and fair election, put his own vice president’s life in danger, and unleashed a violent mob on the U.S. Capitol that left five law enforcement officers dead. And still, the Republican Party stood by him. In the three years since, Trump has become even more unhinged, dangerous and extreme. His entire presidential campaign for 2024 is premised on seeking revenge on his political opponents. Just last week, he attacked the Republican governor of Georgia’s wife and family — who support him — since Gov. Brian Kemp was unwilling to lie about the results of the 2020 election.  Trump wants to be a dictator on day one and his MAGA loyalists are all too willing to let it happen. When a political party bends to the will of a single person and puts them on a pedestal, they’re putting party above country at the expense of the integrity of our institutions and the dignity of our democracy. It’s disgraceful. This is not the Republican Party I know and it’s certainly not a Republican Party I can support.  The good news is, we have another option in this election: someone who values democracy, will uphold the rule of law, and who is prepared to stand with our allies and provide steady leadership to the world.  Vice President Kamala Harris is building a broad coalition that includes everyone because, unlike her opponent, she knows that a president’s job is to serve all Americans, not only those who vote for her.  She will protect our freedoms — including women’s right to make their own health care decisions, while Trump wants to ban access to vital reproductive health care. She will stand by our global partners, from Israel to Ukraine to our NATO allies. She will defend our democracy and ensure we remain a nation in which nobody is above the law. She will work with anyone who’s willing to come to the table, on either side of the aisle, to deliver real results for the American people. It’s why I endorsed Harris, and it’s why I’m a proud member of Republicans for Harris.  To my fellow conservatives: The Republican Party has abandoned you. It’s not too late to reject Trump’s chaos and stand with Kamala Harris, who will defend our democracy and fight for our freedoms.  Harris has a vision for the future of our nation. Trump only wants to drag us back into the past. We have an opportunity to be part of that future, to reshape the Republican Party and to restore America’s leadership. We have a chance to join Republicans for Harris and play a part in protecting America from Trump’s MAGA party. This is the way to reset politics toward principles and end Trump’s dead-end populist movement. Our conservative values guide us to make this choice because our country and democracy depend on it."
Donald Trump opened the door for Democrats to become the party of freedom,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 1:14 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/dnc-democrats-republicans-freedom-abortion-rcna167585,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 21 episode of ""Morning Joe."" If you’re a conservative from the South, I’m sure there’s one word this election cycle that’s stuck out to you: freedom. It’s a word that’s traditionally been used by Republicans, but this time around it’s become central to the Democratic Party’s message. When I see the word “freedom” plastered on signs at the Democratic National Convention, I see the Democratic Party stepping forward — and stepping right through a door that Donald Trump and the United States Supreme Court opened for them with the Dobbs decision. Democrats are telling the American people: No, we’re not going to let the federal government control your body. We’re not going to force women to carry their rapist's babies to term. We’re not going to have state-forced birth for a 10-year-old girl. We’re not going to turn our eyes away from women who are bleeding out outside of emergency rooms. Democrats have taken the idea of freedom away from the Republican Party and the American people are taking notice.  One of the more compelling things I’ve heard from a voter this election cycle came from a self-identified libertarian who said they were concerned about Republicans pushing to take control of people’s bodies and people’s health care.  They asked: If they’re doing it to women this year, what are they going to do to the rest of us next year?"

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Ada Brown set aside the rule nationwide, which had been scheduled to take effect Sept. 4, siding with business interests including the Chamber of Commerce. Brown concluded that the Federal Trade Commission lacked authority to issue the rule and deemed it “arbitrary and capricious because it is unreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation.”  Announcing the rule in April, FTC Chair Lina Khan said that noncompete clauses “keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism” and that the rule “will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.” An FTC spokesperson said after the ruling that the agency was seriously considering appealing and noted that the judge’s decision doesn’t prevent the agency “from addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions.” The government’s prospects on appeal aren’t great, however, given this Supreme Court has been broadly skeptical of agency authority and has struck down Biden administration initiatives. The intermediate federal appeals court covering Texas is the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings have sometimes gone too far right even for the Supreme Court.

Barack Obama’s speech for Kamala Harris shows just how much things have changed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 12:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/obamas-dnc-speech-reminds-us-kamala-harris-share-dont-rcna167612,"During the bitterly divided 2004 presidential election, a Senate candidate from Illinois took the stage and urged Americans to think about their common values instead of their differences. Four years later, then-state Sen. Barack Obama spoke at the convention as the party’s presidential nominee. As a candidate who looked like no past party nominee — referring to himself as a “skinny kid with a funny name” — Obama promised hope and change. These promises had a dual nature: to alter the way of doing politics in Washington and return to common values, while also ushering in a new, bold era for a Democratic Party that had long been in the shadow of Reagan-style Republican ideals. The rhetoric inspired voters, but achieving real change proved to be a much more significant challenge. In his Tuesday address at the Democratic National Convention, the change candidate spoke as a party elder, in a speech that recalled themes from his 2004 address. The former president and former first lady Michelle Obama remain popular, especially among Democrats. And the connection to Vice President Kamala Harris is long-standing, as Obama was a supporter of her candidacies for attorney general and U.S. Senate in California. A lot has changed since he was president; but the old Obama was still there, talking about national reconciliation and asserting that, “none of us wants to live in a country that’s bitter and divided,” and urging patience with others who don’t share all of our views. In a 2009 interview, Gwen Ifill referred to Harris as the “female Barack Obama,” describing a new group of Black politicians who chose public service over a more lucrative private sector career. And, of course, Harris served as the vice president to the politician who was once Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden. At the same time, there are some key differences. Harris isn’t the first Black presidential candidate, but she’s the first after the racial backlash of the 2016 election and the Trump presidency, the 2020 George Floyd protests, and the pushback against teaching the nation’s racial history in some states. Harris is also the child of immigrants at a time when immigration is much more polarized and higher on the public agenda than it was when Obama ran in 2008. She’s not the first woman nominee, but she’s the first to run in a post-Dobbs environment. Before becoming Biden’s vice president, she built her national profile on being adversarial toward Trump and his administration. There will be talk of unity and healing at the DNC, but there’s no denying the political climate has become more intense, and the political significance of identity issues has changed.  Obama’s legacy in the party is complicated. He obviously wanted his presidency to end with the election of his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton. Instead, Donald Trump was elected, along with a Republican-controlled Congress. Scholars of political parties, myself included, have criticized Obama’s party-building efforts and connected them to these political setbacks. His chosen leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schulz, had a tumultuous tenure. Obama didn’t do much to build up parties or progressive networks at the state level, in addition to the losses in Congress at the state level. (Although it wasn’t entirely negative; Obama accomplished some long-standing party goals, including but not limited to the Affordable Care Act and major strides in LGBTQ rights and marriage equality.) The constraints on Obama’s ability to deliver the change he promised weren’t all about the Democratic coalition, either. His was a new era of partisan rancor, driven in large part by a unified and hostile Republican opposition. Congressional Republicans refused to work with the administration, talked about making him a one-term president, and refused to even consider his 2016 Supreme Court nominee. When the GOP won control of the House in the 2010 midterms — a historic midterm-seat loss for the president’s party — the prospect of meaningful legislation largely evaporated.  In 2016, the fissure between the Bernie Sanders and Clinton factions was just taking shape, and led to some uncomfortable moments at the national convention. During the Trump years, the party has changed in a few crucial ways. For one, in the 2018 elections and beyond, record numbers of women, people of color, religious minorities and LGBTQ people have won elected office, reflecting Obama’s legacy of historic political firsts. The progressive wing of the party has asserted itself in national politics and policy with the emergence of the “squad” in the House, and significant attention to the presidential bids of Elizabeth Warren and Sanders.  If Harris wins, it’s far from assured she’ll have Democratic majorities in either house of Congress. But if she does, those majorities will look quite different from how they did in 2009.  Following Michelle Obama’s fiery speech, Barack Obama praised the patriotism and leadership of Biden in his own address. He illustrated Harris’ vision of a bolder Democratic Party, both by talking about policy (housing, labor rights) and also delivering a scathing takedown of Trump and Trumpism. He offered a telling detail about how the Democratic Party has shifted, at one point noting that Harris, as California AG, pushed him on legal action against predatory mortgage lenders. While Obama wove these together by suggesting that his — and the Democrats’ — philosophy is one of “mutual responsibility,” the tension between boldness and reconciliation may be even higher now than it was in 2009 or even 2016. Presidents always balance competing imperatives to lead country and party. And after the presidencies of both Trump and Biden, Harris navigates an environment in which both have changed. In 2008, Obama highlighted his policy differences with his opponent, John McCain, and suggested that Republican ideas had failed, capitalizing on the sour public mood at the end of the George W. Bush presidency. Harris will undoubtedly stress policy differences as well, focusing on Trump’s connections with Project 2025. But it’s hard to imagine Obama calling McCain “weird” as a central line of attack. Obama ran after eight years of a Republican-controlled White House, affording him room to attack and promise reinvention. Harris runs as the sitting vice president, facing a delicate balance between affirming the administration she’s served in while forging her own political identity. But in the changed political environment since 2016, she may prove to be more of a change candidate in the end."
Longtime Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell dies at age 87,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 12:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/longtime-democratic-rep-bill-pascrell-dies-age-87-rcna167611,"It was just last week when longtime Rep. Bill Pascrell checked himself into a hospital because of a high fever, which his staff said may have been caused by a respiratory illness. When he was discharged a day later, there were still some hopes that the 87-year-old New Jersey Democrat would be able run for a 15th term on Capitol Hill. It was not to be. The congressman was readmitted to the hospital Sunday night, and as NBC News reported, he passed away three days later. “As our United States Representative, Bill fought to his last breath to return to the job he cherished and to the people he loved,” the statement said. “Bill lived his entire life in Paterson and had an unwavering love for the city he grew up in and served. He is now at peace after a lifetime devoted to our great nation America.” Pascrell is the fourth member of the 118th Congress who has died, following the passing of Democratic Reps. Donald McEachin of Virginia, Donald Payne, Jr. of New Jersey, and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas. As for the future of his House seat, NBC News’ report added, “Because the vacancy has occurred before an Aug. 27 deadline — 70 days before the general election — Democratic county committee members will be able to handpick a new nominee by Aug. 29, according to state election law.” Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, as well as New Jersey Assembly members Shavonda Sumter and Benjie Wimberly, are apparently among the top contenders. The congressman represented one of New Jersey’s Democratic strongholds, and the party is optimistic about keeping the seat in the fall. But most important today is the work Pascrell did on behalf of his constituents for the past several decades. After serving in the U.S. Army and working as a local educator, he served as the director of public works in Paterson, before later leading the city’s Board of Education. In 1987, he was elected to the state Assembly, and in 1990, he was sworn in as Paterson’s mayor. Six years later, Pascrell made it to Congress, where he earned a reputation as a progressive champion and a policy wonk, especially on matters related to tax policy and infrastructure. In 2019, the New Jersey Democrat even became an honorary member of the liberal faction known as “the Squad.” The congressman also seemed to take special pride in being a thorn in Donald Trump’s side, helping lead the fight to obtain the former president’s hidden tax returns. “In the Congress, Congressman Pascrell has been a relentless champion of America’s working families — fighting for workers’ rights and investments in the education of our children,” House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, wrote via social media. “He was a proud co-chair of the Congressional Italian-American Delegation and took great pride in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey being the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution — and he never let us forget any of it!”"
"Trump campaign co-opts Beyoncé’s ‘Freedom,’ the Harris campaign’s anthem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 11:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-campaign-beyonce-freedom-kamala-harris-rcna167576,"Since launching her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris has used Beyoncé’s “Freedom” as a soundtrack to her candidacy — with the artist’s permission. On Tuesday, a Donald Trump campaign spokesperson appeared to co-opt the song, using it in a video of the former president deplaning in Michigan for a campaign event. “Touchdown in Michigan!!” Steven Cheung wrote in the post on X. He also tagged Trump, who recently returned to the platform. The Trump campaign has used songs without artists’ permission over the years. Several musicians or their estates have asked Trump to stop using their songs at his rallies, and some have threatened legal action. The GOP campaign spokesperson’s use of a song that Harris had established as her anthem of sorts is somewhat ironic. Trump recently accused the Democratic nominee of stealing his proposal to end taxes on tips, a policy she floated earlier this month and one he initially put forward in June. (Though neither candidate has released their full plan, many economists have criticized the idea, saying it would result in workers pressuring customers to tip more and encourage Americans to declare more of their income as tips.) Cheung’s video may prompt legal action from Beyoncé, who is known to be protective over the rights to her music. The singer has not commented publicly on the video. When reached for comment by The Hill, Cheung responded: “Freedom, freedom!”"
What anxious parents of neurodivergent children can learn from Tim and Gwen Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 11:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-children-gus-neurodivergent-rcna166748,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s open acknowledgement that he and his wife used fertility treatments to conceive their two children and his candid discussions about that generated one of the most moving moments during a rally in Glendale, Arizona, when people chanted the name of his firstborn daughter, Hope. The positive reaction to the candidate’s discussion of the topic confirms the thumbs-up that Vice President Kamala Harris got for choosing her running mate from every faction of the Democratic Party — from moderates such as Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va.; progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; and even erstwhile conservative Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., who left the party this year. But Tim and Gwen Walz also deserve positive attention for the way they’ve discussed their son, Gus, who came into the national spotlight thanks to a piece in People magazine, about his nonverbal learning disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. That makes him double-neurodiverse. Simply having a neurodivergent son is not enough reason for him to be praised; indeed, many parents of neurodivergent children have been harmful to their children and peddled harmful ideas, including the idea that vaccines cause autism. Rather, what makes the Walz family’s story so reassuring is that they seem to want to help Gus live a good life rather than change who he is. Follow MSNBC's live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. According to the Child Mind Institute, nonverbal learning disorder, or NVLD, affects nonverbal forms of learning like the ability to notice patterns or learn concepts, including visual and social patterns as well as concepts in language and math. Because of the similar traits, people with NVLD are often confused as being on the autism spectrum and vice versa. Most recently, comedian Chris Rock disclosed that he received a diagnosis after a friend initially thought he might be somewhere on the autism spectrum. But while in the past, much of the focus of society and parents has been on how to ""fix"" people who are neurodivergent, the Walzes, who said they noticed that “it became increasingly clear that he was different from his classmates” and saw that he preferred video games and time to himself, made sure in the People article not to highlight Gus’ deficits. Rather than wring their hands, his parents emphasized that he “is brilliant, hyper-aware of details that many of us pass by, and above all else, he’s an excellent son and brother to his sibling.”  It’s encouraging that the Walzes appear unconcerned with forcing  Gus to be more sociable. That must be a hard temptation to resist for a political family that spends time on the campaign trail. Their focus on what Gus does well is a welcome change from the old days. To cite one infamous example, when a teenage Paris Hilton was diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder, she said she was sent to a residential treatment facility because her parents believed she could be “fixed” with “tough love.” Even today, some children with ADHD have food withheld from them as punishment.  The Walzes’ words and their embrace of their son may seem utterly unremarkable. But that’s the point. Loving your children, celebrating their gifts and embracing them fully ought to be unremarkable whether they’re neurodivergent or neurotypical. Neurodivergent people deserve parents who are dedicated to helping them thrive. They deserve family members who know that the way they love, interact and see the world, while different from their neurotypical counterparts, deserves the same respect.  Walz appears to be doing his part on improving the lives of people with disabilities as governor. As my friend David Perry wrote, he’s worked on phasing out parental fees for children on Medicaid, which would reduce the financial burden for parents of children with disabilities. Similarly, the Walz family is fortunate to live in Minnesota, which has programs like Partners in Policymaking (established in 1987) to help people with disabilities and to help their loved ones become better advocates. An AARP survey ranked Minnesota as the No. 1 state overall for long-term services and supports. As for Harris herself, she was the first presidential candidate to release a disability policy in the 2020 Democratic primary. I still wouldn’t say the Walzes have been perfect in how they discuss their son’s disability. For example, when speaking about his disability, they’ve said that his “condition is not a setback — it’s his secret power.” This statement disregards the real accommodations that Gus will need if he is to go to college or enter the workforce. Similarly, many neurodivergent people chafe at the idea of having a “superpower” because of the implication that their worth is tied to their being superior than their counterparts at some tasks. At the same time, it is still a step forward that the Walz family doesn’t see Gus as deficient and has instead focused on what is possible for him, such as obtaining his driver’s license. Importantly, with the national profile they now have, the Walz family can serve as a model to show parents of children with developmental disabilities the joys that come with embracing, and not mending, their children."
Democrats' crunk-infused roll call featured all your favorite hits,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 10:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/dnc-roll-call-songs-playlist-rcna167529,"Democrats set a new standard with their symbolic roll call votes nominating Kamala Harris for president on Tuesday night. Convention roll calls, in which state delegates huddle together to announce their state party's votes for the presidential nominee, are typically somewhat energizing. (Delegates officially nominated Harris during a virtual roll call earlier this month. Tuesday night’s roll call was ceremonial.) It’s common to see people dressed in state-specific garb, or even to see some celebrities sprinkled among the delegates, showing pride in their home states. But Tuesday’s roll call was an uncommonly lit affair.  Indeed, the celebrities showed out. I spotted director Spike Lee among the New York delegates, ""Desperate Housewives"" actor Eva Longoria stood with delegates from Texas, ""The Wire"" actor Wendell Pierce among the Louisianans, and actor Sean Astin — who starred in the iconic sports film ""Rudy"" — among the delegates from Indiana, just to name a few. But it was the music that set things apart. Led by DJ Cassidy — of “Pass the Mic” fame — this year’s roll call featured state officials awarding their delegates to a playlist of musical salutes for each state.  For example, iconic producer and hip-hop hype man Lil Jon, The King of Crunk, is from Georgia — and after walking out to “Welcome to Atlanta,” he performed a rendition of his songs “Turn Down for What”  and “Get Low” when it was Georgia’s turn to award their delegates to Harris. This resulted in some pretty epic scenes of Lil Jon hyping up a crowd of Georgians that featured Sen. Raphael Warnock and Rep. Nikema Williams.  And although Georgia was the only one with a live performance, virtually every state got their turn. Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” played during that state’s turn to award delegates. Beyonce’s “Texas Hold ’Em” played when the Lone Star State’s delegates announced their support for Harris. New Jersey’s delegates swayed to iconic New Jerseyan Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.” as they awarded their votes. Prince's ""1999"" played when Minnesota announced its delegates. And when Kamala Harris’ home state of California awarded its votes, the soundtrack was a medley of songs by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar. Check out a list of all the songs played below, and reflect on what I think was unquestionably the most turnt-up party convention in United States' history. Alabama “Sweet Home Alabama” — Lynyrd Skynyrd Alaska “Feel It Still” — Portugal. The Man Arizona “Edge of Seventeen” — Stevie Nicks Arkansas “Don’t Stop” — Fleetwood Mac California “Next Episode” — Dr. Dre “California Love” — Tupac “Alright” — Kendrick Lamar “Not Like Us” — Kendrick Lamar Colorado “September” — Earth, Wind & Fire Connecticut “Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I’m Yours)” — Stevie Wonder Democrats Abroad “Love Train” — The O’Jays District of Columbia “Let Me Clear My Throat” — DJ Kool Delaware “Higher Love” — Kygo and Whitney Houston Florida “I Won’t Back Down” — Tom Petty Georgia “Welcome to Atlanta” — Jermaine Dupri “Turn Down for What” — Lil Jon and DJ Snake “Get Low” — Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz Guam “Espresso” — Sabrina Carpenter Hawaii  “24k Magic” — Bruno Mars Idaho “Private Idaho” — The B-52’s Illinois “Sirius” — The Alan Parsons Project Indiana “Don’t Stop 'Til You Get Enough” — Michael Jackson Iowa “Celebration” — Kool & the Gang Kansas  “Carry On Wayward Son” — Kansas Kentucky “First Class” — Jack Harlow Louisiana  “All I Do Is Win” — DJ Khaled Maine “Shut Up and Dance” — Walk the Moon Maryland  “Respect” — Aretha Franklin Massachusetts “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” — Dropkick Murphys Michigan “Lose Yourself” — Eminem Minnesota  “1999” — Prince Mississippi “Twistin’ the Night Away” — Sam Cooke Missouri “Good Luck, Babe!” — Chappell Roan Montana  “American Woman” — Lenny Kravitz Nebraska “Firework” — Katy Perry Nevada  “Mr. Brightside” — The Killers New Hampshire “Don’t Stop Believin’” — Journey New Jersey  “Born in the U.S.A.” — Bruce Springsteen New Mexico “Confident” — Demi Lovato New York “Empire State of Mind” — Jay-Z and Alicia Keys North Carolina “Raise Up” — Petey Pablo North Dakota “Girl on Fire” — Alicia Keys Northern Mariana Islands “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” — Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell Ohio “Green Light” — John Legend Oklahoma “Ain’t Going Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up)” — Garth Brooks Oregon “Float On” — Modest Mouse Pennsylvania “Motownphilly” — Boyz II Men “Black and Yellow” — Wiz Khalifa Puerto Rico “Despacito” — Luis Fonsi Rhode Island “Shake It Off” — Taylor Swift South Carolina “Get Up” — James Brown South Dakota “What I Like About You” — The Romantics Tennessee “9 to 5” — Dolly Parton Texas “Texas Hold 'Em” — Beyoncé Utah “Animal” — Neon Trees Vermont “Stick Season” — Noah Kahan U.S. Virgin Islands “VI to the Bone” — Mic Love Virginia “The Way I Are” — Timbaland Washington “Can’t Hold Us” — Macklemore and Ryan Lewis West Virginia “Take Me Home, Country Roads” — John Denver Wisconsin “Jump Around” — House of Pain Wyoming “I Gotta Feeling” — The Black Eyed Peas"
Hulu’s ‘Baywatch’ doc is a shallow look back at a shallow TV phenomenon,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 12:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hulus-baywatch-doc-glosses-pamela-anderson-cultural-phenomenon-rcna169001,"How did “Baywatch,” the 1990s television show that made Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra household names, insert a specific vision of the California dream in the world’s imagination, turned the red one-piece into a cultural (and sexual) icon, and made the slow-motion run a staple performance for any hottie on the beach. What did this hugely popular show mean for America, and perhaps the world? A new Hulu docuseries, “After Baywatch,” tries to answer just that. Spoiler: It doesn’t. But it does paint an illuminating picture of a shallow, hollow show made up of a shallow, hollow cast, as embodying some of the worst of '90s pop culture. It also explores how the show set the stage for the rapidly devolving cheap entertainment that would eventually bring us reality TV and social media influencers. The most compelling star of “Baywatch” remains the most compelling person several decades later: Pamela Anderson. Anderson, though, didn’t sit for interviews for this documentary. After a life of tabloid exploitation, she has moved back to her Canadian hometown, where she has traded in her signature pencil-thin brows, smokey heavily lashed eyes and over-lined lips for a bare face. She’s been renovating her house. She runs a skin care brand. She’s an animal rights activist. She likes to hang out with her dogs. Anderson isn’t absent from the documentary — filmmakers use old interviews to piece together her storyline — but the documentary’s treatment of her is flat and insubstantial: She was a compelling Playboy model who turned the magazine into a feeder for “Baywatch” talent; the paparazzi were aggressive; a leaked sex tape almost ruined her career but she got through it and, afterward, sex tapes actually catapulted some B-listers like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian to fame. The only somewhat interesting revelation is that David Hasselhoff initially didn’t want Anderson on the show because he worried everyone would be looking at her and not him. In reality, there is much more to say about Anderson, and how she was a mess of contradictions that parallel so much of '90s life for young women: She was super sexy and sexualized, and with that came the presumption that she had no right to privacy even in her most intimate sexual affairs; she partied and had bad taste in men and was happily a little bit trashy, which seemed to give permission to the public to ignore or even tongue-wag at the fact that she was married to a violent domestic abuser — a fact Anderson herself doesn’t seem to have totally processed or addressed, downplaying husband Tommy Lee’s abuse even decades later. Even now, she seems to both want to leave her past behind while not totally reckoning with it. This is not so unlike the broader public’s relationship to the decade that made Anderson famous and the show that helped define it. Paris Hilton, arguably the Pam Anderson of the next decade — blond, beautiful, widely mocked, widely followed, the victim of her own leaked sex tape (made with a man who would go on to marry and divorce Anderson) told a reporter in the early 2000s, “My boyfriends always tell me I’m not sexual. Sexy, but not sexual.” This ideal, that women be sexually performative for men, but not actually sexual for themselves, was at the heart of both “Baywatch” and turn-of-the-century expectations for female celebrities. As the show went on, the legs of the red Baywatch suits got higher-cut and the necklines dropped lower, but the scripts remained cheesy and even wholesome. Sometimes, there just wasn’t enough actual footage to fill the show’s full run-time, and so it was padded with montages of California sunsets, perky butts on beaches, and of course the notorious slo-mo breast-bouncing runs down the sand. The “Baywatch” docuseries, unfortunately, doesn’t do much to address the way in which the show both reflected and perpetuated the decade’s disparate views on female sexuality. And to be fair, the show’s cast — now Botoxed and fillered into the wide-eyed and duck-lipped aesthetic familiar to anyone who has tuned into a Real Housewives episode — simply does not seem capable of, or at least interested in, even the moderate intellectual inquiry required to offer any real insights about the show’s greater impact or meaning. “We had the gorgeous ones,” Hasselhoff observes about the “Baywatch” actresses. “And we had the real ones. But they’re all real. Because they all went in the water.” (His general diagnosis of the show’s quality? “The show — it wasn’t good. But we made it good.”) Carmen Electra takes a stab at assessing the show’s feminist impact by musing, “I think ‘Baywatch’ was ahead of its time. Because the men were featured. And men looked hot.” Actor after actor observes that being in the show “changed” their life. The docuseries, alas, seems unlikely to change anyone’s life, or even deepen anyone’s understanding of “Baywatch;” by the end of the first installment, one begins to wonder how it was even-stretched into four parts (the answer: significant repetition and, like the show itself, many bouncy montages). Perhaps this is the unintentional lesson. Not every cultural artifact has some deeper meaning. Sometimes, people make dumb things, and the rest of us watch because we’re animals who like boobs and washboard abs and the suggestion of sex. The '90s didn’t invent that impulse, although it was the decade in which it arguably went into overdrive. And now, 30 years later, we have an unending glut of sexy-but-not-sexual drivel from reality TV to TikTok. Not to mention a former president (and perhaps future one) who has joined right in, starring in his own reality TV show and having an affair with a porn star that doesn’t sound like it was particularly enjoyable for her. But we also have new language to talk about this cultural coarsening, and new, better standards for the women whose lives and bodies were so often treated as stand-ins for our collective sexual dysfunctions. Pamela Anderson isn’t just living her best life on a Canadian island; she’s been culturally rehabilitated. The paparazzi-harassed and sexually exploited women who followed in her footsteps — Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and so on — have also seen a more feminist public help them to rewrite their stories. While television has been saturated with cheaply made trash, viewers have also rebelled, opening up space for a TV renaissance. The post-“Baywatch” era brought some of the best television ever made to the viewing public. It’s too bad that this much more interesting stuff was ignored in favor of asinine observations and Jeremy Jackson saying he sniffed his fellow cast members’ bathing suits. But this was, for better or worse, “Baywatch”: empty, appealing to little more than a viewer’s most basic impulses, and flimsy as a little red one-piece."
How one doctor’s cooperation could affect the case against the other in Matthew Perry’s death,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 10:14 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/matthew-perry-doctor-plea-deal-ketamine-overdose-rcna169052,"The cooperation of Dr. Mark Chavez, who has agreed to a plea deal in the criminal case stemming from actor Matthew Perry’s fatal ketamine overdose, could help federal prosecutors in California make their case against Dr. Salvador Plasencia, the other doctor who's been charged. Plasencia is indicted alongside Jasveen Sangha, whom prosecutors say is also known as “the Ketamine Queen.” Both have pleaded not guilty. A total of five people have been charged, including Chavez and two others who have already pleaded guilty: Erik Fleming, who admitted to distributing the ketamine that killed Perry, and Kenneth Iwamasa, the actor’s live-in personal assistant. Fleming admitted that he got the ketamine from Sangha and distributed it to Iwamasa. Prosecutors said that Iwamasa conspired with Sangha, Fleming and Plasencia to obtain ketamine illegally and provide it to Perry, and that Iwamasa admitted to repeatedly injecting Perry with the powerful anesthetic without medical training, including multiple times on Oct. 28, 2023, the day the “Friends” actor died. In his plea agreement, Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Plasencia, and prosecutors say he obtained more of the drug for Plasencia by making false representations to a wholesale ketamine distributor and by submitting a fraudulent prescription in the name of a former patient without that patient’s knowledge or consent. A review of the indictment shows how prosecutors might use Chavez to help make their case against Plasencia. One of the more damning allegations refers to text messages between Chavez and Plasencia in which Plasencia discussed how much to charge Perry for ketamine, stating: “I wonder how much this moron will pay” and “Lets find out.” While such evidence speaks for itself and can easily turn a jury against a defendant, having Chavez on the stand to narrate their conversation and speak to the broader alleged conspiracy could strengthen the government’s hand at trial. The indictment references multiple communications and actions between the two doctors, for which Chavez could set the scene and fill in any details.  NBC News reported that a federal judge on Friday accepted Chavez's plea agreement, and that his lawyer said he has already entered into an interim suspension of his medical license that sets up a surrender of it later. “My client wants to do the right thing,” the lawyer, Matthew Binninger, reportedly said. “He’ll be cooperating going forward.” If that cooperation includes trial testimony, defense lawyers would have fodder for cross-examination, as happens in any case with cooperating witnesses. In addition to the incentives that Chavez has to help the government, that he engaged in not only criminal behavior but fraudulent behavior is something else that the defense could focus on. However, to the extent that Chavez’s testimony would be corroborated by other evidence, such as text messages, there may be only so much that defense lawyers could do.  To be sure, it’s early yet in the recently charged case, and the remaining defendants could plead guilty as well. Relatively few cases go to trial. Their lawyers would at least discuss the possibility with them, especially in the face of such potentially damning evidence in a high-profile case.

"Trump headlines Moms for Liberty summit, despite trying to distance himself from Project 2025",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 9:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-moms-for-liberty-heritage-foundation-project-2025-rcna169087,"At the Moms for Liberty annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Donald Trump aired grievances about his political rivals and leaned into culture war issues. In his ""fireside chat,"" he attacked President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and he disparaged trans people and migrants crossing the U.S. border. But aside from his ramblings — which The Guardian described as ""long, zigzagging and at times incoherent"" — the Republican presidential nominee's appearance at the event also underscored his connection to the Heritage Foundation, the architects behind the Project 2025 plan that Trump has taken pains to distance himself from. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization that has served as a personnel pipeline to GOP administrations and crafted policy proposals that have been picked up by Republican officials, has ties to the far-right Moms for Liberty, which has been labeled an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 2022, the organization awarded Moms for Liberty its Salvatori Prize for Citizenship, which came with a $25,000 cash award, according to its tax filing that year. The Heritage Foundation is also one of 10 sponsors of the Moms for Liberty summit this year, as The Washington Post reported. And Moms for Liberty is listed as a “coalition partner” for Project 2025, an action plan for Trump’s second term that was drafted by the Heritage Foundation. Amid public backlash to Project 2025, Trump has tried to separate himself from the document, despite a number of allies and former Trump administration officials' involvement in drafting it. He has disavowed the project and claimed ignorance of the people behind it. But his politics inherently tie him to the organization's sphere of influence, and supporters of Project 2025 have likened Trump's public rejection of the plan to ""two siblings in a fight."" Trump's appearance at the Moms for Liberty event further undermines those efforts. At the event on Friday, he received a personal endorsement from Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, who said that while the group is ""nonpartisan,"" she personally supports Trump for president."

Kamala Harris’ Georgia trip highlights a savvy broader strategy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-georgia-trip-beat-trump-rcna169018,"This week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz went boldly where no major presidential campaign has gone in several decades… Savannah, Georgia.  This is a big deal because it signals the Harris-Walz campaign is not relying solely on running up vote totals in heavily Democratic Atlanta and its nearby suburbs; Democrats are also trying to narrow the margins in the more conservative, rural areas. In those locations, it is not about actually winning whole towns or counties; it's about losing them by less. The strategy reminds me of how Barack Obama approached the Iowa caucuses in 2007 and his 2004 Senate campaign before that. He showed up in both blue counties and blue cities and in rural counties, small towns and places where many people were surprised to see him.   This was also the strategy Sen. Raphael Warnock implemented in 2020 and 2022 in Georgia. Warnock’s former campaign manager Quentin Folks is now Harris’ principal deputy campaign manager. A rural Georgia native, Folks recently said, “You have to really stave down margins and go places even when you don’t think you can win it outright… You know you’re going to lose that county, but just showing up there can sometimes be the difference between 5 to 10 percentage points, or sometimes just putting an office there.” One bus tour does not win an election, but it does show a willingness by the Harris-Walz campaign to meet people where they are and to put in the work of showing up. As much as politics has changed over the last several years, it turns out there’s still value in a good old fashioned bus tour. On Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment against Donald Trump in Smith’s federal election subversion case. Smith re-tooled the indictment in an effort to take out anything that could violate the Supreme Court’s July ruling on immunity — basically anything that leaned too heavily into Trump’s official role as president.  That meant removing allegations that Trump used the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud, and reshaping the way the indictment described Mike Pence’s role in the election certification process. It also required Smith going to an entirely new grand jury. And while none of that should have been necessary, Andrew Weissmann has pointed out that now five grand juries have found probable cause to believe Trump committed multiple felonies. That’s not a small thing. This trial will not see the inside of a courtroom before the election, and if Trump is elected it probably won’t proceed at all. But for now, Smith isn’t giving up. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a mullet at the DNC. But I think it’s fair to say there will likely be more mullets in the event’s future.  For many, the August convention was their first introduction to John Russell, also known as “mullet guy.” But if you’re on TikTok, you’ve probably known about him for a long time. Whether interviewing labor leaders like UAW president Shawn Fain or educating people about CEO pay, Russell has been making waves as an activist and content creator for years. If you’re interested in hearing more from Russell, make sure to check out his Substack (“The Holler”), or you can find him across social media at the handle @heyjohnrussell. What, besides his trademark hairstyle, makes Russell stand out? It’s not just his self-described role as a “dirtbag journalist” or his background as a seasoned dive bartender — Russell knows how to speak to the party’s base, wherever they are. This fantastic video of him interviewing swing voters in Elliott County, Kentucky is a great example.  You can watch my interview with Russell this Sunday at 12 p.m. ET, where we’ll be talking all things labor, DNC, and mullet maintenance. What show are you bingeing right now? We’re doing a lot of hanging out on YouTube right now. I’ve been really loving Dan Toomey’s show “Good Work.” It does my favorite thing, which is wrapping serious and boring topics in comedy, kind of like how you wrap your dog’s medicine in cheese.  What’s the last book you read? “The Long Deep Grudge: A Story of Big Capital, Radical Labor, and Class War in the American Heartland” by Toni Gilpin.  What time do you wake up on the weekends? When my body tells me to, which depends heavily on the events of Friday night.  How do you take your coffee? In my belly, no matter what’s in the coffee. "

The old viral clip shows 18-year-old Caitlin “Caite” Upton, who was Miss South Carolina Teen USA at the time, flubbing an answer after being asked about Americans’ knowledge of geography. Vance posted the video on X and wrote: “BREAKING: I have gotten ahold of the full Kamala Harris CNN interview.” Upton, who has since appeared on “The Amazing Race” and in a number of commercials, has said that she dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts over the fallout from the incident. In 2015, she told New York Magazine that she “went through a period where I was very, very depressed.” “I had some very dark moments where I thought about committing suicide,” she told the magazine, beginning to tear up. She added: “Sorry, it’s just really emotional. This is the first time I’ve actually been able to talk about it. It was awful, and it was every single day for a good two years.” On Friday morning, Vance told CNN that he was not aware that Upton had contemplated suicide and said that he hoped she is doing well. The Ohio senator went on to say that it would be best to just laugh it off. “Look, I’ve said a lot of things on camera; I’ve said a lot of stupid things on camera,” he said. “Sometimes when you’re in the public eye, you make mistakes. And again, I think the best way to deal with it is to laugh at ourselves, laugh at this stuff and try to have some fun in politics.” Vance also took issue with being asked about the post instead of the “real” crises facing American families, lamenting that “politics has gotten way too lame” and “way too boring.” “You can have some fun while making a good argument to the American people about how you’re going to improve their lives,” he said. When asked if he would apologize, given what he now knows about Upton, Vance replied: Vance’s attempt at scoring internet points — and then his refusal to apologize — was not received well, including by Upton herself. In a post on X on Friday morning, she wrote: “It’s a shame that 17 years later this is still being brought up. There’s not too much else to say about it at this point. Regardless of political beliefs, one thing I do know is that social media and online bullying needs to stop.” Upton’s account appears to have since been deleted."
Trump seeks to leverage immunity ruling in New York hush money case ahead of sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:21 AM PDT / Updated Sept. 4, 2024, 6:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-case-sentencing-federal-court-move-rcna168957,"UPDATE (Sept. 4, 2024, 7:10 a.m. ET): A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Donald Trump's second bid to move his New York hush money case to federal court. UPDATE (Aug. 30, 2024, 5:58 p.m. ET): On Friday, an entry on the federal court docket told Donald Trump’s lawyers that their filing attempting to move Trump’s state criminal case to federal court was deficient, noting that it did not include the opposing party’s consent or the court’s leave to file, which, the docket entry noted, the court had not granted. Ahead of Donald Trump’s sentencing in his so-called hush money case, which is set for Sept. 18 in New York state court, the former president’s lawyers are attempting once again to move the criminal case to federal court. They lost a previous attempt to do so last year, but that was before the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling, which they’re now citing as a reason for the case to proceed in a federal forum. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office “violated the Presidential immunity doctrine in grand jury proceedings, and again at trial, by relying on evidence of President Trump’s official acts during his first term in Office,” Trump’s lawyers wrote in their federal court filing Thursday. While they more vaguely raised the immunity issue in their failed removal attempt last year, they wrote in this latest filing that they “could not have anticipated the subsequent federal developments culminating in Trump v. United States,” referring to the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority’s immunity ruling. That high court decision came in the federal election interference case, where Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion laid out a vague test for determining which official presidential acts are immune from prosecution, as distinct from private acts that aren’t. Trump’s New York state charges — 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, related to an alleged cover-up of a hush money scheme ahead of the 2016 election — didn’t involve official presidential acts. But the issue the immunity ruling raised for the case stems from another part of the Supreme Court ruling, one that curbed the use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of unofficial acts. Trump has a pending motion in state court to overturn his May guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. Judge Juan Merchan set a Sept. 16 deadline to rule on that issue and is scheduled to sentence Trump two days later, assuming the judge rejects Trump’s immunity claim. But that sentencing date was recently put in doubt when Trump’s lawyers asked Merchan to postpone the sentencing, because they want to immediately appeal if he rejects their immunity claim. Bragg’s office didn’t fully object to the further delay, instead saying it would defer to the judge. Merchan hasn’t yet ruled on whether he’ll adjourn the sentencing; Trump’s federal court filing on Thursday said that the judge had told the parties that he would rule on the defense adjournment request “on or before” Sept. 5. Now the Sept. 18 sentencing date is further called into question, pending word from federal court about whether the case will proceed there or get kicked back to Merchan. The more important overall issue in the case, however, is whether the guilty verdicts can stand under the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling or prosecutors will need to retry the case. That question may ultimately need to be answered by the high court. The issue of federal court removal is also at play in the state election interference case in Georgia, where one of Trump’s co-defendants, his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, has a pending Supreme Court petition on the matter, in which Meadows also cites the immunity ruling.

The clash between those values — plus worries that Russian President Vladimir Putin poses a risk to the whole of Europe — is prompting the country to rethink its defense stance. In a bombshell report released on Thursday, a group of experts recommend to the government that the country, which has been neutral since 1515, work on a ‘common defense capability’ with the EU and NATO.” * Someone seems awfully worried about sentencing: “Lawyers for Donald Trump argued for a second time Thursday that his criminal hush money case should be heard in federal rather than state court, a move that could end up delaying the former president’s sentencing date next month.” * A case worth watching: “Several large American publishers sued Florida education officials on Thursday over a state law that prohibits sexual content in school libraries.

JD Vance nags billionaire Peter Thiel to throw money at Donald Trump's campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 2:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-peter-thiel-donations-rcna169051,"Republicans are shook over Democrats’ fundraising efforts, and we’re starting to see them look for ways to change the momentum.  One sign? Sen. JD Vance is pushing his billionaire benefactor and mentor, Peter Thiel, to throw his financial heft behind the Trump campaign. Thiel, who shares elements of Vance’s brand of far-right, technocratic illiberalism, supported Trump in 2016 and helped fund the senator’s 2022 election bid, but this year Thiel has said he’s not interested in endorsing a candidate after his disappointment with Trump’s presidency. Thiel did say he might change his mind, though. Vance appears to be banking on it.  “I’m going to keep on talking to Peter and persuading him that — you know he’s obviously been exhausted by politics a little bit — but he’s going to be really exhausted by politics if we lose and if Kamala Harris is president,” Vance said in an interview with the Financial Times. “He is fundamentally a conservative guy, and I think that he needs to get off the sidelines and support the ticket.” (A representative for Thiel did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.) Vance is taking a slightly different approach than Trump, who in recent months has openly threatened CEOs who don’t endorse him. And without subpoena power of his own, Vance has also been forced to take a different approach than House Republicans and Republican attorneys general, who’ve opened investigations into the fundraising platform ActBlue, which Democrats have used to notch historic fundraising hauls since Vice President Kamala Harris entrance into the race. “These inquiries point to unspecified allegations of possible foreign money laundering or identity theft supposedly being carried out by bad actors on ActBlue,” Fast Company reported. ActBlue told the outlet, “in 2024, it is all too commonplace to see attempts to spread disinformation from the far-right and our organization is prepared to address the bad actors.” Recent fundraising data give us some insight into what may be driving Republican concerns. The Harris campaign significantly out-raised the Trump campaign in July, which The Washington Post notes may allow her “to air more ads and maintain a larger payroll than her Republican opponent in the final months of the race for the White House.”  There are already signs that the huge fundraising hauls Team Harris has raked in have allowed it to reach out to voters in areas Democrats might have otherwise deprioritized without so much cash on hand. This week, they launched an ad campaign in the area around Trump’s home in Florida.  When you consider all of that, it seems clear why Vance would be pushing for his party's top cash cow to get out of the barn and into the milking shed."
What’s next in Adnan Syed's case after court keeps convictions intact for Hae Min Lee's murder,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 1:34 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/adnan-syed-whats-next-murder-hae-min-lee-rcna168996,"In the Adnan Syed legal saga’s latest step, Maryland’s top court kept intact the convictions of the man whose case was popularized by the “Serial” podcast that raised questions about his guilt. The court was closely divided in Friday’s decision — with nearly 200 pages total written by the majority and dissenting justices — in the appeal that didn’t turn on Syed’s culpability but rather a victim’s rights issue that requires further proceedings in the closely watched case and has broader implications for criminal justice generally.   After being convicted in 2000 of killing Hae Min Lee, Syed’s high school ex-girlfriend, the state’s attorney for Baltimore City moved to vacate Syed’s convictions in 2022. But the problem, as the Supreme Court of Maryland saw it, is that Lee’s brother, Young Lee, wasn’t properly afforded his rights in connection with the 2022 hearing that freed Syed.  The state high court recounted: The lower court granted the state’s motion to vacate Syed’s convictions after that hearing, ordering prosecutors to set a new trial or drop the charges. The state did the latter but Young Lee appealed. An intermediate appeals court said that he had a right to reasonable notice of the hearing and the right to attend in person, yet the appeals court also said that crime victims and their representatives don’t have a right to be heard at the hearing.    On Friday, the state Supreme Court agreed that Young Lee had the right to receive sufficient notice and attend in person, and it further decided that crime victims or their representatives do have the right to be heard.  “Because Mr. Lee’s rights as the crime victim’s representative were violated and Mr. Lee has made a sufficient showing of prejudice, this case will be remanded to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for further proceedings,” the state high court said in the opinion by Justice Jonathan Biran, joined by three other justices over three dissents. “On remand, the parties and Mr. Lee will begin where they were immediately after the State’s Attorney filed the motion to vacate,” Biran wrote, adding that the case needs to go to a new judge, to “avoid the appearance that allowing Mr. Lee and/or his attorney to speak to the evidence at a new vacatur hearing may be a formality.” Though the underlying proceedings sought to remedy a perceived injustice to Syed, the state high court concluded, “the prosecutor and the circuit court worked an injustice against” Young Lee.  And while the court approved the reinstatement of Syed’s convictions, it declined to reincarcerate him. Syed, now 43, was sentenced to life in prison, plus 30 years, for the 1999 strangling of Hae Min Lee. He served more than 20 years before his conviction was overturned in 2022 after prosecutors dropped the charges against him, citing flawed evidence. The matter may well conclude with Syed’s vindication if Young Lee is afforded his rights as outlined by the state court. But it remains uncertain precisely how or when this legal story ends.    Striking a much different tone and raising different concerns, dissenting justices called the case “a procedural zombie” that’s been “reanimated, despite its expiration,” further arguing that the majority created victims’ rights that didn’t exist and that the “new hearing requirements harken back to the days of yore before victim-initiated prosecutions were constitutionally abolished.”  Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Ruben Gallego’s disturbing letter offers Phoenix police a major gift,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 1:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/ruben-gallego-letter-phoenix-police-doj-consent-decree-rcna169023,"It now seems clear what Senate candidate Ruben Gallego is offering in response to the endorsement he received from the Trump-friendly Arizona Police Association: complicity. On Tuesday, I wrote about what that endorsement means for Kari Lake, the Republican in his race. In essence, because the Democratic congressman was already up in the Arizona polls, and because he already was receiving support from Republicans, this was an endorsement he didn’t even seem to need. Which is why it was pretty devastating for Lake. But it’s starting to look pretty damning for Gallego as well. And that’s because just one day after receiving the Arizona Police Association’s endorsement, Gallego wrote a letter to the Justice Department downplaying the findings of a damning DOJ report released in June, which revealed that the Phoenix Police Department had routinely used excessive force and violated the civil rights of racial minorities and homeless people. Gallego’s letter asks the DOJ not to pursue a consent decree — essentially, an agreement in which a police department makes changes overseen by a federal monitor — for Phoenix police. In other words, he opposed one of the most effective means of ensuring that the Phoenix Police Department is held accountable. After the report was released, Phoenix urged the DOJ not to seek a consent decree. And Gallego’s letter essentially echoes the same talking points, claiming that a consent decree would be burdensome for the department and writing that the DOJ’s findings of “a mere 120 or so unspecified incidents” represent an “exceptionally small fraction” of service calls. He also maintained that several of the cases identified by the Justice Department have already been addressed. Gallego — in contrast with Phoenix residents who have spoken out against police brutality in their city — concluded that “it is clear that a pattern or practice of civil rights violations does not exist” and proposed that the DOJ instead pursue what’s known as a technical assistance letter: Gallego’s letter — which you can read in full here — basically asks the DOJ to allow Phoenix police to police themselves. And coming from Gallego, who launched his political career off of his past activism against racial profiling — specifically, Arizona’s controversial “show me your papers” law — the remarks read like a betrayal. They certainly smell of self-interest. Gallego emerged on the political scene as a critic of police discrimination. Now it seems he thinks the best way to advance his career is by downplaying it. Aside from the morality issue, it seems like an unnecessary political risk. Though Gallego has been polling several points ahead of his opponent, the presidential race in Arizona is on track to be much more competitive. And with that in mind, it’s pretty stunning to see a Senate candidate taking needless actions that could discourage the Black and Latino voters Democrats will need if they want Kamala Harris to win in Arizona. Gallego has yet to address the letter publicly, including on his social media platforms. Let’s hope we hear from him on the subject soon."
"Ruby Freeman, Shaye Moss are going after Giuliani's assets now that his bankruptcy case is dismissed",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 1:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/freeman-moss-giuliani-assets-defamation-judgment-rcna169015,"Two Georgia election workers have asked a judge to enforce the almost $150 million defamation judgment in their lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani by forcing him to turn over his luxury properties and a host of other assets. In a filing Friday, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the mother-daughter duo who won a defamation case against the former Trump lawyer over his 2020 election lies, asked a judge to issue an order for Giuliani to turn over his assets and grant them control of the property he fails to turn over, as well as the ability to sell them. “Those remedies are overwhelmingly justified under New York law,” the filing says. “And they are all the more appropriate in the context of this case, where Mr. Giuliani has proven time and again that he will never voluntarily comply with court orders, much less voluntarily satisfy Plaintiffs’ judgment.” Some of the assets Freeman and Moss list are a 1980 Mercedes-Benz, “various items of furniture,” a television, sports memorabilia (including a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt), three Yankee World Series rings and 26 watches. The women’s pursuit of Giuliani’s assets has been a long time coming. Freeman and Moss have yet to begin collecting on the money that Giuliani has owed them since December, when he filed for bankruptcy shortly after they won their suit against him. (Giuliani is appealing that verdict.) However, during bankruptcy proceedings, Giuliani’s creditors accused him of providing false and misleading information about his assets and claimed he was using bankruptcy to avoid payment. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane ultimately decided to dismiss Giuliani’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy altogether, citing in part the disgraced lawyer's lack of cooperation in the proceedings. That dismissal earlier this month opened the door for Freeman and Moss to go after Giuliani's assets as a means to recover some of the money they’re owed. Giuliani has expressed no remorse for his treatment of Freeman and Moss. After he was found to have defamed them, he continued to baselessly accuse them of stealing the 2020 election, until a judge ordered him to stop in May. At the Republican National Convention in July, he told CNN he did not regret his statements and likened his legal troubles to “the Japanese internment” during World War II. In a statement to The Hill about Freeman and Moss’ latest request, Giuliani’s spokesperson Ted Goodman on Friday accused the women’s legal counsel of trying to “harass and intimidate” the disbarred lawyer. “This lawsuit has always been designed to censor and bully the mayor, and to deter others from exercising their right to speak up and to speak out,” Goodman said."
"Nearly six weeks later, Trump can’t shake his fixation on Biden",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 12:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nearly-six-weeks-later-trump-cant-shake-fixation-biden-rcna169047,"At Donald Trump’s latest campaign rally in Michigan, Donald Trump started to share some conspiracy theories about independent polls — which the former president is convinced are “rigged” — when he had a related thought. “You know, we were up massively by Biden,” the Republican said. “How would you like to be me? I spent $100 million on beating Biden.” Moments later, in case the sentiment wasn’t clear the first time, he again said, “I spent $100 million on fighting him.” It was a timely reminder, as a HuffPost report put it this week, “Donald Trump just can’t quit Joe Biden.” For those keeping score, President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21, which was roughly 40 days ago. Common sense suggests Trump, with fewer than 10 weeks remaining before Election Day 2024, would be focusing all of his attention on Harris and not the retiring incumbent. And yet, there was the former president this week, publishing an item to his social media platform that read, “You know, if Biden didn’t do the Debate, he would be the Democrat Candidate for President right now. The fact is, Debate or no Debate, the Democrats really did a number on him!!!” At face value, the GOP candidate’s missive wasn’t wrong — but it was irrelevant given the circumstances. It was nevertheless part of a larger pattern. The day before Trump published that item to his platform, he was in Michigan, whining about Biden ending his candidacy. Six days earlier, the Republican also complained that Biden’s exit was “not fair.” In the preceding days, Trump made related comments, longing for the days in which the incumbent was still running, over and over and over again. What’s more, when the GOP nominee isn’t attacking Biden for no reason, and pleading for Biden to stick around, Trump is peddling fan-fiction about the Democratic president re-entering the 2024 race. To be sure, I’m well aware of the Republican’s motivations. As we’ve discussed, Trump was feeling quite good about the state of the race when Biden was still his opponent. The former president was ahead in the polls; Democrats were divided; and much of the national analysis was about the expanding electoral map, as traditional “blue” states started to appear more competitive. The Republican had reason to be pleased: He was winning. Indeed, Trump’s assumptions about his inevitable victory contributed to his decision to pick an unpopular far-right running mate: As the GOP nominee saw it, he could get away with adding Sen. JD Vance to the ticket — as opposed to a qualified candidate with broader electoral appeal — because the race was effectively over. And now it’s not. But while the former president’s frustrations are understandable, they’re also increasingly pitiful. Biden is retiring after a half-century of honorable public service. The quicker Trump comes to terms with the new landscape, the better off he’ll be. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why Harris and Walz's first major interview was a win for the campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 12:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-tim-walz-interview-cnn-media-rcna169019,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 30 episode of ""José Díaz-Balart Reports."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s first joint interview aired on CNN on Thursday night, and, based on what I saw, the Harris campaign should be quite proud. The candidate at the top of the ticket, Harris, went out and did what she needed to do. As for Walz, the governor was able to speak directly to the American people about the Republican attacks on his military service and set the record straight. For voters outside of Minnesota who are less familiar with Walz, I’m sure they got some of the answers they may have been looking for.  The discourse over the last few weeks would have you believe that Harris hadn’t sat down for an interview since she became the vice president. But the way she handled herself Thursday, it was clear she was comfortable answering questions. CNN’s Dana Bash did a good job at pulling the layers back and digging into what the American people really wanted to hear.  People will always want more, but Thursday’s interview was a great start. Going forward, voters need more opportunities to hear from the Democratic ticket — in various ways — whether that be more sit-down TV interviews, print interviews or gaggles with the media between campaign stops. Overall, there was no harm done to the Harris-Walz campaign during the interview and a little news was broken. As a communications veteran, that’s a win from my perspective.

Let's dispel the myth that Harris will be any different from Biden on Gaza and Israel,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-cnn-biden-rcna168949,"Vice President Kamala Harris said U.S. policy on arming Israel will not change if she is elected president, echoing the Biden administration's line on expressing tepid sympathy for Palestinians being killed and starved in Gaza while staunchly affirming support for Israel's vicious military conduct in the war. In her first interview as the Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday, Harris showed that she is in lockstep with President Joe Biden on the issue, rejecting calls — including from fellow Democrats — to withhold weapons from Israel over its siege on Gaza. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 40,000 people so far and injured more than 93,000, according to health officials in Gaza. “Let me be very clear: I am unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself, and that’s not going to change,” Harris told CNN when asked whether she would halt “some” arms shipments to Israel. She went on to talk in detail about Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, which killed 1,200 people. “As I said then, I say today: Israel ... has a right to defend itself. We would,” she said. “And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” When asked flat-out whether her policy would differ from Biden's on ""arms and so forth,"" Harris said no. She then spoke about the urgency in landing an agreement to release the hostages held by Hamas and secure a cease-fire in Gaza, a deal she said would end the war and “unlock so much of what must happen next.” “I remain committed since I’ve been on Oct. 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and, in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,” she added. Conditioning weapons shipments to Israel has been a chief demand from pro-Palestinian activists. Biden himself had threatened to withhold supplying arms to Israel over its assault on Gaza in May, but that threat ultimately proved empty. If there was any hope that Harris’ approach would be meaningfully different than Biden’s — that she might stop providing political and unconditional military support to Israel in this war, and that she might be willing to seriously pressure Israel to adhere to international law in its military operations in Gaza — those hopes were entirely crushed by her remarks on Thursday. As vice president, Harris’ rhetoric on the deep suffering of Palestinians set her apart from the Biden administration’s actions. Her comments afforded Biden some political cover, and after he withdrew his re-election bid, there was optimism that a Harris administration would take a more just, humane position. But as a presidential candidate herself now, Harris is showing that she is ultimately no more politically or morally courageous on this issue than Biden."
This ‘very demure’ TikTok star is being ‘very mindful’ about getting credit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/demure-tiktok-jools-lebron-handled-trademark-rcna168843,"“Very demure, very mindful” has caused a situation that’s become very contentious. TikTok creator Jools Lebron captivated the platform with her videos about cultivating the right look for work and, in the span of a couple of weeks, spawned a viral meme, a spate of celebrity responses, a Verizon ad and an appearance on ABC’S “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” But shortly after the store cashier’s catchphrase went viral, several people separately rushed to register variations of “very demure” as federal trademarks. None of them have any kind of relationship with Lebron. Jefferson Bates applied for “Very Demure .. Very Mindful ..” on Aug. 20 as a trademark for advertising, marketing and promotional services; Kassandra Pop sought “very demure very cutesy” on Aug. 24 for advertising services; and Almondia White filed for “always demure and very mindful” on Aug. 27 for hats and apparel. Those applications, made by people trying to exploit the virality of Lebron’s phrases, left her bereft and her fans enraged. Amid tears on a recent TikTok, Lebron says, “This merch situation is really f---ing me up. I invested so much money and time in this, and I feel like I did it wrong. Like, I feel like I didn’t try hard enough. I wanted this to do so much for my family and provide for my transition, and I just feel like I dropped the ball.” At the end of the brief recording, Lebron says, “I, like, don’t even know what I could have done better because I didn’t have the resources.” Those other people’s applications, while perhaps tacky, are not necessarily doomed to fail. A trademark is a source indicator — it tells potential purchasers who makes or stands behind a product, not who named it. Trademark law does not care who popularized a word or phrase, only who used it first (or applied to register it first) in connection with the sale of goods or services. But neither are the applications by those who beat Lebron to the punch guaranteed to succeed. Each will be examined by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and published for opposition, a process that can take between six and nine months. Anyone who believes, as Lebron does, that the registration will harm their business, can argue that it should be refused. Each of the three pending applications was filed based on the applicant’s stated plan to use the mark in the future, so they’ll eventually need to demonstrate that they’re using the mark in commerce — which they have up to three years to do. Fewer than half of intent-to-use based applications eventually turn into registered marks, and the odds of abandonment are likely higher for applications to register viral phrases. There are also a handful of reasons that the USPTO might refuse these applications, either of its own accord or in response to opposition by Lebron. One is use: a phrase has to be used as a trademark to gain protection. If White, for example, simply sells T-shirts that say “always demure and very mindful” across the front, that’s considered an ornamental use, not a trademark use, and it wouldn’t earn her a registration. Instead, she would need to print the phrase on tags inside or attached to the shirt to show that it’s her brand. The USPTO might determine that the “demure” phrases are too ubiquitous to function as trademarks and conclude that the public won’t associate them with a particular source because they function more like informational slogans or rallying cries. Hashtags like #SayHerName and expressions like “God Bless the USA” have been refused registration on that basis. Another way Lebron might come out on top is by establishing priority. If she can show she used the phrase first — not just in videos or appearances, but as a brand name in connection with products she sold or services she provided — then she can show her rights predate theirs, and the other marks will be refused registration if they create a likelihood of confusion with hers. Much of the internet rushed to judgment after Lebron’s tearful TikTok, and some of her loyal followers accused Bates of stealing Lebron’s thunder. That said, the feeling that the phrase is closely associated with Lebron could work in her favor in the trademark process if the USPTO thinks that consumers will be deceived by someone else’s use of her catchphrase as a mark. The office rejected an application for “fear the brow” as a trademark for clothing in 2011 on the grounds that consumers who purchased goods bearing the mark might believe themselves to be supporting then-Kentucky Wildcats basketball player Anthony “The Brow” Davis. But he had nothing to do with that application. In a much happier video posted Tuesday, Lebron said of the trademark situation, “We got it handled, and I’m gonna leave it that. We got it handled. Mama got a team now.” She didn’t provide more details. Lebron’s struggle to capitalize on her cultural contributions is representative of the challenges that creators, and particularly creators of color, have long faced. As I wrote in my essay in the book “Feminist Cyberlaw,” “access to formal intellectual property protection requires access to information, capital, and expertise.” That’s essentially the point that Lebron made in the TikTok about the other trademark applications, when she said she didn’t know what she could have done better “because I didn’t have the resources.” As I wrote for ""Feminist Cyberlaw,"" “intellectual property laws are structured to privilege and protect some forms of innovation, commerce, and art over others—and those forms of knowing and creating tend to be predominantly white and male.… [T]he creative and entrepreneurial endeavors of women, people of color, and members of other marginalized groups are less likely to be rewarded with protection and exclusive rights.” Lebron could mean any number of things when she says her team “got it handled.” She may file her own trademark applications, plan to oppose other attempts to register marks that build on her work, send cease-and-desist letters, file lawsuits alleging trademark infringement, attempt to negotiate with the other applicants, or any combination of those. Her team might also try to cultivate backlash against the interlopers and publicly shame them into abandoning their applications. That strategy led Disney to walk away from its application to register “Día de los Muertos” and Momofuku to cease enforcing its registration for “chili crunch” against competitors. Because while Lebron is known for being demure, her lawyers don’t have to be."
"Against election backdrop, economic growth beats expectations (again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-backdrop-economic-growth-beats-expectations-rcna169008,"As August got underway, there was a sharp and unexpected downturn on Wall Street. As a recent New York Times report summarized, it was easy to explain: Investigators grew skittish due to a combination of a disappointing jobs report, trouble in Japanese markets, and concerns that the Federal Reserve had waited too long to lower interest rates. For Donald Trump and his party, however, the truth was clearly inadequate, so they rewrote it. In the Republicans’ version of reality, the brief Wall Street slide was obviously Vice President Kamala Harris’ fault. From the Times’ article: The rhetorical push was, of course, utterly ridiculous. The idea that a sitting vice president is responsible for brief and entirely predictable stock-market losses was absurd, but the GOP candidate and his allies expected voters to believe it anyway. At least, that is, that was the Republicans’ message four weeks ago. As August comes to end, Americans are no longer hearing much about the “Kamala Crash,” in large part because there’s been no crash. All of the losses from earlier in the month have been regained, and as NBC News reported, economic growth in the United States continues to look good. The latest data is roughly in line with the kind of quarterly GDP reports we saw across much of Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency — when Republicans said Americans saw the greatest economy in the history of humanity. The results also poses a challenge for the former president and his allies, which they haven’t even tried to address: If voters are supposed to believe that Harris is directly responsible for the world’s largest economy, how much credit are Trump and the GOP prepared to give the incumbent vice president for 3% GDP growth? As for the Republicans’ crystal ball, four years ago, Trump told supporters that Democratic policies would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” He’s begun making similar predictions ahead of Election Day 2024. Everything Trump said and predicted was wrong — and the former president hasn’t even tried to explain why his predictions were so hilariously misplaced, or why anyone should believe his new predictions in light of his awful track record. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why Kamala Harris is messaging Latino voters without using the word 'Latino',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 9:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-poll-latino-hispanic-voter-election-rcna168830,"It’s still early days, but Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance among Latino voters is looking promising. According to a Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday, 56% of Latino registered voters prefer Harris, compared to 34% for former President Donald Trump. That’s a significant surge from when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July; at that time the same poll found Harris was leading by just 6 percentage points, 44% to 38%. This comes as recent polling data from Equis Research, a research organization focused on the Latino electorate, has found that Harris’ entry into the race has let Democrats “reset” with Latinos and that she is outperforming Biden’s 2024 campaign with this demographic.  Yet despite this good news, Harris has yet to reach Biden’s levels of Latino support in the 2020 campaign, according to Equis. As she looks to rebound even further with Latinos, Harris’ campaign is trying a new tack: approaching them pretty similarly to the way they approach all American voters. As The New York Times notes, Harris’ first ad targeting Latino voters, released a few weeks ago, departed from Democrats’ standard messaging toward the demographic in a striking manner. The ad begins with a mention of Harris’ “immigrant mother,” but it makes no explicit mention of Latino identity or immigration as a policy issue. Instead, it discusses Harris’ record and commitment to fighting corporate exploitation, lowering costs of housing and drug prices, and defending abortion rights. In other words — the same set of issues that Harris has been hammering home in her campaign appearances. The ad represents a gamble: Democrats are experimenting with a new approach to attracting one of the most important demographics in the American electorate in a tight race. But it’s one I’m cautiously optimistic about, because what Democrats were doing previously wasn’t working terribly well. Latino voters have leaned toward Democrats for decades. But they are not a monolith. For example, a majority of Cuban American registered voters identified as Republicans in 2020, in part because of their familiarity with and objections to the left-wing government in Cuba. Moreover, Latinos are a relatively young demographic and their views are in flux. Trump performed better with Latinos in 2020 than he did in 2016, and since then Latinos have continued to identify with Republican Party in even greater numbers. Biden was looking even worse this time around with the demographic until he dropped out. For some people, this is counterintuitive. Trump’s offensive comments about immigrants, draconian immigration policies and his nationalism might seem like they would turn off a community of voters who often have ties to recent immigrants — or are immigrants themselves. But the data makes it clear that it’s a mistake to assume that Latinos are categorically different from other Americans when it comes to their positions on immigration and how much they care about the issue. Earlier this year, Equis found that Latinos in seven battleground states trusted Trump more than Biden on immigration policy. And despite the trope of Latinos as immigration focused, polls find that they’re far more concerned about the economy than anything else —  just like most Americans. In other words, it’s not only a mistake to assume Latinos are immigration doves, but also that it’s a top tier issue for them. Harris has wisely declined to focus heavily on her own racial and gender identity in her campaign, instead placing her focus squarely on kitchen table issues. An approach to Latino voters that channels that same energy — with some targeted tweaks in tone and framing, as the aforementioned ad did effectively — is consistent with that attitude.  There are reasons to think it could bear fruit. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign was unusually effective at garnering Latino voters, something his Latino press secretary, Belén Sisa, attributed in part to his class-first approach. Here’s how she explained his popularity among Latinos in an interview in 2020: Harris’ economic policy platform isn’t nearly as progressive as that of Sanders, but its focus on lowering costs and calling out corporations could resonate similarly. Of course, messaging alone won’t do the trick —  Sanders’ campaign made a serious push to aggressively invest in Latino outreach from the very beginning of its campaign. Carlos Odio, a co-founder of Equis, recently emphasized to New York Magazine that Latinos are “the swingiest element of the electorate more broadly, are these low-propensity irregular voters who don’t have fully formed partisan identities.” One thing we know about swing voters and irregular voters is that they care a ton about the economic picture. To win this election, Harris has to paint a good one. "

Why Trump’s new line on IVF is so difficult to take seriously,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-line-ivf-difficult-take-seriously-rcna168975,"A week, apropos of nothing, Donald Trump published a one-sentence missive to his social media platform. “The Republican Party is charging forward on many fronts,” the former president wrote, “and I am very proud that we are a LEADER on I.V.F.” And what, pray tell, would that mean in practice? Six days later, a possible answer came into sharper focus. NBC News reported: “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump said before adding, “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.” The wording led to some confusion about the relevant policy details. Does the Republican nominee, who didn’t pursue anything along these lines during his four years in the White House, envision a model in which the federal government would pick up the tab for IVF services — comparable to an existing policy on dialysis — or one in which private insurers would be forced to cover the costs? When NBC News sought clarification, the former president said that one option would be to have insurance companies pay “under a mandate, yes.” When CNN asked vice presidential nominee JD Vance how this would work in states that ban IVF, he didn’t have much of an answer, either. It seems, in other words, as if Team Trump has some homework to do when it comes to how all of this would work. Still, this is an unusually progressive announcement from a radically far-right candidate, isn’t it? It would be, if the GOP candidate’s rhetoric were believable. Indeed, the Harris campaign responded to the news with a press statement featuring several notable bullet points: We could go further down this same path, noting just how many of Trump’s own allies are looking forward to his prospective second term precisely so that they can undermine IVF access. For that matter, given that Trump tried to repeal, undermine, and sabotage the Affordable Care Act, it’s probably best to take all of his promises related to health care with a grain of salt. But I’m also struck by the broader policy circumstances. For many years, Republicans have condemned the idea of socialized health care coverage and staunchly opposed private insurance benefit mandates. And yet, here’s Trump, looking for a winning campaign issue, insisting that Americans’ IVF treatments will be covered, either through socialized health care coverage or a private insurance benefit mandate. The party’s principles on health care are firm and inviolable — except when they’re not."
"In interview, Harris vows to include a Republican in her Cabinet",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 7:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/interview-harris-vows-include-republican-cabinet-rcna168968,"In her first major television interview since President Joe Biden ended his re-election plans, Vice President Kamala Harris broke some new ground with CNN’s Dana Bash: The Democratic nominee vowed to appoint at least one Republican to her White House Cabinet if elected. As The Washington Post reported: She prefaced her comments by saying, “I’ve got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would, I think, [add bipartisanship to the White House Cabinet]. I think it’s really important.” The vice president didn’t reference any Republicans by name, though it’s easy to identify some of the GOP figures who’d be in contention. After all, Harris has already received endorsements from a variety of notable Republicans — some of whom are currently in office, others who are former officials — and Democrats included several GOP speakers at the party’s national convention in Chicago. It’s worth noting for context that this wasn’t just a stray comment for Harris: Before the interview even aired in its entirety on CNN, the Democrat’s campaign issued a press statement promoting the vow about adding a Republican to her prospective Cabinet and encouraging people to watch a video excerpt of her comments. In other words, Team Harris leaned into this one. There’s no great mystery as to why: Trump appears to have overwhelming support on the right, but the Democratic candidate believes she can assemble an electoral coalition that includes independents and GOP voters who might be skeptical of their party’s scandal-plagued nominee. The Cabinet vow bolsters her credibility on bipartisanship. What’s more, it ties Harris to a modern, pre-Trump tradition of sorts. The Washington Monthly’s Bill Scher — in a piece published before the CNN interview — explained, “[A] modicum of cross-pollination in a cabinet is historically common. Every president, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Barack Obama, had at least one cabinet member from the opposite party for some time during their administrations. Obama appointed three Republicans to his cabinet, including Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former CIA Director Robert Gates as secretaries of defense, and his Illinois colleague, Representative Ray LaHood, as transportation secretary.” Trump broke the streak, and despite his many bipartisan victories, Biden hasn’t had any GOP members on his Cabinet. Harris, however, apparently intends to restore the modern trend. Will Trump respond in kind with a comparable promise? It’s possible, though it’s difficult to imagine what Democrat would agree to join his team."
Why plans for the next presidential debate still aren’t finalized,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/plans-presidential-debate-still-arent-finalized-rcna168955,"Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are scheduled to appear together on a debate stage in just 11 days. Whether that will actually happen isn’t nearly as clear as it should be. It appeared that there was a breakthrough of sorts earlier this week. On Tuesday afternoon, the former president, who’s struggled for weeks to make up his mind about participating in the Sept. 10 event, announced in a written statement that the two major-party campaigns had “reached an agreement,” and the debate would be aired on Sept. 10, as planned. In the same online missive, the Republican claimed that “the Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate,” suggesting the candidates’ microphones will be muted except when they’re answering questions, just as his team had hoped. Soon after, Team Harris explained that negotiations about the microphone issue were still ongoing, Trump’s statement to the contrary notwithstanding. That was Tuesday. Two days later, an Associated Press report suggested the underlying questions had been answered. Around the same time as the AP report reached the public, the Trump campaign hosted a press call, assured reporters that the mic issue had been “worked out,” and as the Republican operation wanted, “the microphones will be off.” So, that’s that? No. As NBC News reported, Harris campaign spokesman Brian Fallon added soon after in a statement issued via social media, “Our latest understanding is that even though Trump said Monday he would be fine with an unmuted mic, his handlers don’t trust him to spar live with VP Harris and are asking ABC to ignore Trump’s comments and keep the mics muted or else they will back out of the debate for a third time.” The spokesperson for the Democratic nominee continued, “We have been asked to accede to Trump’s handlers’ wishes on this point for the sake of preserving the debate. We find the Trump team’s stance to be weak, and remain in discussions with ABC on the final rules.” All of which suggests the negotiations have not been finalized, despite the claims from the GOP campaign. As for why, exactly, this seemingly obscure point has become so contentious, there’s no great mystery here. An NBC News report explained, “Inside the Harris campaign, the thinking is that there shouldn’t be guardrails, and that viewers should see a full, unbridled Trump. Officials there argue that Trump’s handlers don’t trust their own candidate and charge that for all the talk of Biden showing cognitive decline, it’s Trump who is struggling to stay on track with his arguments. Showing him unleashed only benefits Harris.” Indeed, Team Harris hasn’t been subtle on this point. Brian Fallon told Politico on the record this week, “Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. We suspect Trump’s team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit they don’t think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.” It’s difficult to say with confidence when, whether, or how this will be resolved, but time is obviously running out.

New details suggest Trump’s Arlington controversy won’t end soon,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 5:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-details-suggest-trumps-arlington-controversy-wont-end-soon-rcna168944,"Donald Trump’s Arlington National Cemetery controversy was already a mess for the former president, though a statement from the U.S. Army took the fiasco to a new level on Thursday morning. An Army spokesperson began by emphasizing, in writing, that those participating in Monday’s wreath-laying ceremony were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and Pentagon policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. But just as notably, the Army spokesperson went on to explain that an employee who works at the cemetery attempted to ensure adherence to the rules when she was “abruptly pushed aside,” despite Trump campaign denials about a physical altercation. According to the Army, the employee “acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption.” In case this isn’t obvious, the Army generally goes out of its way to avoid issuing provocative statements related to politicians, especially during a campaign, but in this case, the branch made an exception. For his part, the Republican nominee delivered public remarks on the matter for the first time hours later, misstated the date of his visit to Arlington, bragged about being on time for the event at the cemetery, characterized himself as a victim of smear, and concluded that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “killed” American service members in Afghanistan. If that sounds ridiculous and offensive, it’s because it was ridiculous and offensive. Around the same time, Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, on the heels of publicly criticizing the official who works at the cemetery, issued a statement online that called the office of the Army Secretary a bunch of “hacks.” So to recap, the former president — who remains burdened by a dreadful record related to respecting U.S. troops and veterans — isn’t just caught up in a controversy about exploiting one of the nation’s most sacred spaces and ignoring Arlington’s rules against politicization, his campaign team is simultaneously picking a public fight with the United States Army less than 10 weeks from Election Day. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, there’s a burgeoning conversation about uncovering answers that have not yet reached the public. Politico reported: VoteVets, a progressive veterans group, wasted little time in throwing its public support behind the Democratic senator’s efforts, and there’s a related push underway from several House Democrats. Mark Esper, who served as Trump’s Defense Secretary, has also called for an investigation into the incident. Where will the controversy go next? Watch this space."
Kamala Harris is reaching out to rural voters. That will help her win — and govern.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-bus-tour-rural-voters-rcna168615,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' barnstorming tour of rural Georgia showed not only her plan to win the election, but also how she would govern as president. While Donald Trump has long made clear that his only priority is ""his"" voters, Harris' bus tour of Southeast Georgia with running mate Tim Walz showed that she knows the president is supposed to represent every American. Over two days, Harris and Walz met with voters, students and business owners before Harris held a solo rally in Savannah on Thursday. The campaign says this was the first time a general election presidential nominee stumped in the coastal city of Savannah since the 1990s. Bill Clinton and Al Gore also prioritized rural parts of the state on a similar bus tour during their successful 1992 campaign (the last time Democrats picked up Georgia in a presidential election before President Joe Biden and Harris narrowly flipped the state back in 2020). But the investment in the Harris-Walz campaign’s playbook to defend toss-up Georgia goes beyond the bus. It expands their footprint across the state, what the campaign calls the “largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle.”  Earlier this month on “The Weekend,” Harris-Walz's principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks (who led Georgia Sen. Raphael’s Warnock’s successful statewide run), said the campaign’s rural voter outreach demonstrates how Harris would run an “inclusive” administration. Fulks added that Harris and Walz are “fighting for all Americans regardless of if your county votes red or your county votes blue.”   Harris’ “inclusive” campaign strategy isn’t reserved for just the Peach State. Harris and Walz kicked off their bus tour earlier this month, meeting with voters in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, a county Trump won in 2020 by nearly 18 points. And Walz hosted his first solo rally in his home state of Nebraska. The Cornhusker State is one of two states that divides up electoral votes by congressional district. While most of Nebraska is red, Harris and Walz hope to secure the electoral vote in the state’s swing 2nd District. That strategy is about raw vote totals, but it’s also about the ethos of Harris’ campaign. “I promise to be a president for all Americans,” the vice president said during her convention acceptance speech. “You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power,” Harris declared. Georgia voters know a thing or two about the need to preserve free and fair elections. Trump and his allies worked to nullify their votes in 2020, and Georgia Democrats are already bracing for Trump’s effort to possibly challenge election results in November. The DNC and Democratic Party of Georgia sued the Georgia State Election Board this week over new rules they fear could interfere with the vote certification. An overwhelming win by Harris in the state would make it harder for Trump and his allies to overturn the results. That’s why the campaign is working to reach voters in every part of the state, no matter their ZIP code.   But Harris’ plan to win Georgia sends a clear message to voters in other states: She’s ready to serve every American. Listening to the voices of Americans across the political spectrum will not just help her campaign; it will help her govern.

Why Kamala Harris is getting the last laugh after Trump’s CNN interview criticism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:26 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 29, 2024, 8:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cnn-interview-rcna168598,"The hype preceding Kamala Harris’ first and utterly unremarkable “sit-down” interview as a 2024 presidential candidate is a reminder that nobody running against Donald Trump is ever graded fairly. Imagine arguing that Harris, an elected district attorney, attorney general of California, U.S. senator and incumbent vice president, should treat an interview with a CNN reporter as a high-stakes affair; that is, that she could say something that made her appear less qualified than Trump. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, apparently believing Trump’s ticket needed even more misogyny, suggested in a social media post Thursday that Harris would be incapable of holding her own. It is as it has ever been since Trump has been on the political stage: We watch to see if anything Trump says isn’t a lie, and we watch to see if other politicians say anything that’s the least bit false. In an ideal world, nobody would have been sitting on the edge of their seats wondering if Harris would sound knowledgeable or prepared for an interview — if only because she could never sound less knowledgeable or less prepared than her opponent so often does. The interest in the CNN sit-down was elevated, though, in large part because the media had made it such a big issue that she hadn’t done such an interview in the first place. And along with the suggestions that a candidate is deliberately avoiding the media come the suggestions that she’s afraid of the media. Harris exhibited no such fear Thursday. She came across as the typical politician — and I mean that in every sense. She directly answered the questions that she thought would benefit her candidacy, and she was deliberately evasive on specifics. To her credit, I think that the American media has wrongly contributed to what I’ll call the fetishization of a president’s first day in office. No, the vice president didn’t give a convincing answer when asked what she’d do “day one,” and yes, CNN’s Dana Bash asked the question again in a bid to try to force her to answer it. But the bigger problem isn’t so much that Harris didn’t give a straight answer; it’s an absurd question — even if it’s one that political journalists have come to think they have to ask. In setting the stage for the interview, recorded at Kim’s Café in Savannah, Georgia, CNN showed a clip of Trump saying of Harris, “She’s not a smart person.” That’s the same tack Vance took in his social media post that likened Harris to a young beauty contestant completely overwhelmed by an interview question. It’s hard to know exactly what part of that attack on Harris’ smarts we should assign to sexism and which part we should assign to racism. But there’s no denying the presence of both. Former President Barack Obama, president of the Harvard Law Review and a “senior lecturer” in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, was one of the most cerebral presidents we’ve seen, and, yet, there were billboards and bumper stickers that, referring to the country where his father was born, read, “Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing its idiot.” But Harris, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem recently pointed out, doesn’t want to get trapped in questions about identity. We saw that when she addressed Bash’s question about Trump’s lying and saying she only recently described herself as Black. She told Bash, “Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.” Nor did she focus on race and sex when asked about the viral photo of her grandniece watching her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. She said she wants to be the president for everybody. Her opponents are going to work hard, though, to reduce her to those elements of her identity. And slyly suggest that because of those elements she’s not up to the task. But they’re the ones seemingly not up to the task, seeing as how they set a bar so low that she couldn’t help but sail right over it. In response to the interview, Trump described it as “BORING!!!” He wasn’t wrong about that. But I think Harris is banking on voters’ choosing boring over the drama — no, let’s be real and call it the chaos — that Trump inevitably brings."
Dems played Trump’s game better than he does on Night 2 of the DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/night-2-dnc-obamas-pritzker-trump-roast-rcna167577,"Democrats turned Night 2 of the Democratic National Convention into a full-on Donald Trump roast session. The best mockery all shared a consistent theme: Trump is too small a man to be deserving of the presidency because America has outgrown his petulant, self-serving type of leadership. Tuesday was cathartic for those in the Democratic Party who wanted to see Democrats show some resolve by fighting back against Trump’s unhinged insults with a lil’ flavor of their own. And many of them delivered with some pointed jabs at his self-image.  Trump and his followers like to portray him as a larger-than-life figure — an icon, an American idol. But with their carefully placed digs, Democrats brought him down to size with remarks about his smallness or weakness: his unimpressive intellect, his juvenile self-obsession, his unstable finances, and his petty competitiveness about … crowd sizes. Here are some of my highlights: Former President Barack Obama’s quip mocking Trump’s weird focus on crowd sizes — and the, shall we say, suggestive hand gesture Obama made while cracking the joke — have taken the internet by storm. Seriously, great comedic timing from Obama here. But the underlying point was a powerful one: Trump is too concerned with trivial score-setting to be an effective president. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s remarks about Trump’s rabid attacks on her and her husband over the years portrayed Trump as a petty bigot. A man too small-minded and self-conscious to respect two hard-working Black people who ascended to great heights on their own merit — and, unlike him, couldn’t “expect an escalator to take us to the top” when confronted with a mountain. “His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black,” she said. U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks lobbed a similar attack when she claimed Trump and his movement have consumed America’s focus and limited our political imagination.  The Maryland Democrat said:  Other than Barack Obama, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker may have hurt Trump’s ego the most with his comments mocking Trump’s finances and his intelligence at once. ""Donald Trump thinks that we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich,” Pritzker said. “But take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”  Pritzker and his fellow Democrats had the DNC feeling like Def Comedy Jam at points on Tuesday, which clearly played well in the room and online. But importantly, they used those jokes to pivot to the very real, very serious discussion about the threat a second Trump election might pose to American democracy. Good speechcraft all around."

To my disappointment, Dad wasn’t reporting from a baseball diamond. The 1992 Republican National Convention was packed with people in silly hats, draped in banners and flags. They cheered speakers in suits and danced during breaks. When the speeches were done, Tom Brokaw appeared to tell us what they meant. The common connective tissue was red, white, blue. Even at 7, I knew this celebration of the American democratic experiment mattered. But conventions probably mattered for me more than most. My parents met at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City. Dad was an aide to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mom was a writer for the Village Voice. There’s nothing like tracing your eventual birth back to the Carter-Mondale campaign. Four years later, the DNC served as the defining moment of my father’s political career. Before becoming the revered moderator of “Meet the Press,” he spent a distinguished decade in New York politics. First in Buffalo, then with Moynihan and eventually with Gov. Mario Cuomo. The 1984 DNC in San Francisco bore witness to Cuomo’s heralded “Tale of Two Cities” speech. As the governor’s counselor and communications director, Dad helped write more than 60 drafts. Line by line, Cuomo shattered Ronald Reagan’s presentation of America as a shining city on the hill and reminded folks about the dark forgotten side of Reagan’s idealistic American projection. I think Dad knew he’d never top that — and switched careers. My first convention was the 2000 RNC in Philadelphia, holding my father’s duffel bag of research. I don’t recall much aside from Dad putting me on the spot to do an imitation of The Rock, in front of the WWE star, in the NBC booth. In 2004, I watched a state senator from Illinois deliver the speech that would launch him on a path to the White House; I watched New Yorkers pay tribute to President George W. Bush’s perfect first pitch at the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium, thrown while Ground Zero was still a smoldering heap of dust and debris. The video narrated by the late Sen. Fred Thompson brought the entire convention to tears. Dad died on June 13, 2008. I gave a eulogy that resonated with a lot of people — including TV executives at NBC — who gave me the unique opportunity to launch my reporting career from the 2008 conventions. They were familiar ground. My Dad believed they showcase the best of American democracy. “Conventions are where you tell the people who you are, what you’re about,” he once told me. Each side pumping up their candidate and having a conversation with the nation, free from censorship or sabotage. I don’t think in his darkest thoughts, he’d ever imagine an America where democracy could very well be at stake. He passed away a few days after The Economist published a cover of John McCain and Barack Obama titled “America at its best.” He died when our presidential election was between a popular maverick and a young senator headlining a historic campaign. The election of America’s first Black president was supposed to be the start of a more unified post-racial society, but instead turned into a long-drawn-out campaign of division and disdain. I witnessed the beginning. I watched Obama accept the nomination from inside a football stadium. Just a few decades after Black Americans achieved equal access to the ballot box. A wave of change was churning deep. I was on the convention floor in Minneapolis when Sarah Palin stole her running mate's thunder and launched the underpinnings of what is now the MAGA movement. I felt bad for McCain, ever the loyal soldier to his party, as he got sucked into a vortex he could no longer control. It was evident he was uncomfortable with what had spawned. At the Tampa RNC in 2012, just two years after the ascension of the tea party, GOP nominee Mitt Romney, a humble and decent man, said he wished Obama “had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn’t something we have to accept.” Can you imagine hearing that today at a Republican convention? I watched 2016 on TV, thankful to be out of politics. Yet, I felt an urge to participate. Conventions have that power. But I didn’t return for another eight years. This week, I’m back in Chicago. Back where it all started personally and professionally. Yet, there’s a gutting feeling this could be the last. As my former colleague Brian Williams framed it so eloquently during his last MSNBC show: The former firefighter’s warning did not fall on deaf ears. It’s OK to be scared. These are not normal times. Not long ago, the events of Jan. 6 would have forced a national party into some soul-searching. Instead, the GOP has reverted to the mean — and nominated the man responsible for the domestic terrorist attack at the Capitol. Loyalists who do not believe the results of the 2020 election occupy important electoral positions in pivotal states. By design, it’s now harder to vote in many places in America than it was four years ago. Experts on authoritarianism watched this year’s RNC with alarm. Attendees yelled “Fight! Fight Fight!” as their leader appeared, still sporting the bandage from a near-assassination attempt. The scenes reminded some of 1930s Germany. And, indeed, the Republican nominee seems hell-bent on vengeance, stating his desire to prosecute political opponents and deploy the United States military in a domestic capacity. Make no mistake, America benefits from having a major conservative party. I lived in San Francisco and have seen firsthand the limits of liberalism. Endless group think and vicious party politics coming before the concerns of the people is a recipe for a disaster. There’s a reason our founders strived for balance. But I’ve also traveled and spent time in Turkey, once the democratic jewel of a troubled region. In the last eight years, academics, judges and dissidents have been jailed on bogus charges. Opposition parties harassed and threatened by an increasingly autocratic regime. People distrusting of their neighbors. It was never supposed to happen in Turkey. It’s not paranoid to worry about America slowly slipping into a less democratic country. The people’s will can be contorted for authoritative rule. Despite the lurking danger, Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz have espoused “happy warrior” personas. They are not distraught; they project a sunny optimism and inherent belief that the American people want to see a freer and more democratic future. Polling suggests Harris has erased much of Trump’s lead, buoyed by enthusiasm from youth and minority voters. Co-opting the GOP’s ""freedom"" rhetoric, Harris and Walz are pushing for an America where citizens are free from autocratic tendencies, gun violence, judicial overreach and discrimination. Democrats are framing a clear choice for voters — does freedom mean being able to buy an assault rifle or birth control pills? All conventions are deemed to be “historic,” but in 2024, this is not hyperbole. If Trump wins, conventions in 2028 may look very different. A first step of autocratic regimes is outlawing rival parties — and their ability to meet. We hope that such a travesty would never happen in this country. But we cannot know for sure that it won’t. No matter your political ideology, enjoy the DNC this week. Do not take it for granted. We are not a land of kings and queens, but of immigrants and empowered voters. My late father’s era in politics feels long gone. Civility is an afterthought and democracy feels more fleeting. But Chicago will be flooded with effervescent American pride for the next few days, at least. Let’s cherish it."
Trump’s interactions with Israel’s Netanyahu draw fresh scrutiny,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-interactions-israels-netanyahu-draw-fresh-scrutiny-rcna167580,            
Doug Emhoff got personal about Harris and their blended family at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-democratic-national-convention-rcna167538,"Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, spoke admiringly of his wife, Vice President Kamala Harris, and their blended family Tuesday night, pitching her to voters as a tough but trustworthy leader. ""Kamala is a joyful warrior,"" Emhoff said, employing a term that has come to define her campaign. ""And here’s the thing about joyful warriors: They’re still warriors, and Kamala is as tough as they come."" Emhoff charted his relationship with Harris from their first blind date — ""For generations, people have debated when to call the person you're being set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m., and yet that's when I dialed."" — to how easily she fit in with his family. Emhoff, who has two children from a previous marriage, spoke affectionately about his blended family, which right-wing figures have sought to make a point of attack against Harris for not having biological children. “Those of you who belong in blended families know that they can be a little complicated,” he said. “But as soon as our kids started calling her ‘Momala,’ I knew we’d be OK.” Emhoff's speech on the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a reintroduction of sorts for himself, too. He talked about his childhood in New Jersey and his fantasy football league. The first Jewish spouse of a U.S. president or vice president, Emhoff said that Harris — who is Baptist and was raised in a Christian and Hindu household — has helped deepen his connection to his faith. Harris is scheduled to accept her party’s nomination Thursday, which Emhoff said is also their 10th wedding anniversary. He urged voters to trust Harris with their families as he did his. ""America, in this election you have to decide who to trust with your family’s future,"" he said. ""I trusted Kamala with our family’s future; it was the best decision I ever made."""
Was J6 a Precursor?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-was-j6-precursor-rcna167581,"As Donald Trump’s sentencing date approaches, he and his lawyers are throwing all the spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord break down the former president’s request to adjourn his sentencing until after the election, and the Manhattan DA’s response. Then, ProPublica reporter Joshua Kaplan joins for a deep dive into his reporting on unlawful American militia groups. Andrew and Mary talk with him about the threat these paramilitary groups pose, how they’ve used Trump’s denial of the election results for recruitment and spreading their ideology, as well as the dangers of collaboration with law enforcement.   Here is Josh Kaplan’s ProPublica investigation: Armed and Underground: Inside the Turbulent, Secret World of an American Militia. (Included is a response from Meta about the use of Facebook as a recruitment tool.) Also a note: We’re expecting a joint filing in the DC case next Tuesday, so we’ll release our episode on Wednesday so Mary and Andrew can detail what’s in that filing.  Andrew Weissmann: Hi and welcome to Prosecuting Donald Trump. It is Tuesday morning, August 20th. I’m Andrew Weissman and I’m here with my wonderful co-host, Mary McCord. How are you, Mary? Mary McCord: I’m well this morning. How are you? It’s actually unbelievably cool in Washington, D.C. this Tuesday morning. It was in the 60s with coffee on the back porch. I had a run and didn’t feel like I was about to die. So very happy with the change in the weather. Andrew Weissmann: So, it’s so funny you said that because it must have been a cold front on the East Coast because I’m up North and it was in the low 50s. Mary McCord: Yeah. Wow. Well, you’ve got a flannel shirt on. I can see. Andrew Weissmann: I’ve got a flannel shirt on and I’ve got wool slippers on. I mean, it’s just like grandpa here. Mary McCord: Yeah, there you go. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, we have such a different and great show and it’s such an important thing. And I just want to say we have a guest on as people know from who listen to this, we don’t typically have guests. And what we’re trying to do here is really talk about something that is preventative. You know, we’ve talked a lot about the four criminal cases, but we have this wonderful guest in an area that Mary, you are such a national expert in because of your, I hate to say it, day job. The day job outside of this podcast, but we’re going to talk about militias. And we’re really going to talk about the problem and trying to anticipate what could happen and how to deal with what could happen as opposed to talking about the criminal cases of what happened. Mary McCord: Right. We’re looking forward, not backward. So that guest is Josh Kaplan. He’s a reporter with “ProPublica” and he will be joining us in our second and third segments to talk about his new deeply investigated piece about one of the largest American militia groups and the threat that that group and others pose to our democracy and to public safety. It’s a piece that I talked with him about while he was reporting on it. But before we get to that, Andrew, we do have to update and give our own thoughts on the latest. And I will say, last week when we did our podcast, I said, I’ll bet you anything, Trump comes in right away and seeks to postpone his sentencing in Manhattan. Well, not that it took any kind of like crystal balls -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- to make that up. Yeah, I know. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, how did you possibly think that would happen? Mary McCord: That is going out on the limb, Mary. But it was really quick, right? It was not waiting till September 16th till Judge Merchan makes his decision on immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: It was like immediate. You should right now postpone this. And that was done by letter form. So let’s kick it off there, Andrew, your reactions to not only the request to postpone sentencing to, let’s be clear, after the election, but also the D.A.’s response because he responded quite quickly. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So his response was unsealed yesterday. So I first have a sort of caddy response to Donald Trump’s submission. It’s a one-page letter that is the most unreadable letter. Mary McCord: It’s really bad, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: It’s single-spaced at the margins change so that it goes from one end to the other. And it’s almost impossible to read. Mary McCord: I agree. Andrew Weissmann: And it’s also a bit of stream of consciousness. Mary McCord: Totally. Andrew Weissmann: We’ve talked about his filing, his legal filing to Judge Merchan and how, like, my guess is it was not written by the trial team. It reads like it was written by Supreme Court advocates in anticipation of where this is going to go. It was in striking contrast to the letter, which was basically in form unreadable and in substance unreadable. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But just so people understand what their argument is, because if you strip away the detritus and get to the substance, what they’re really saying is, look, Judge, the way you’ve done this is that you’ve got a ruling that’s coming out on the immunity issues on September 16th, and assuming you rule against us, you are going to have sentencing on September 18th. That’s two days. And we think, that we have appellate rights, whether it’s state or federal appellate rights, but you’ve only given us essentially kind of a day to do that in which case we would seek a stay from you, we would seek a stay from an appellate court, because we shouldn’t have sentencing if this use of immunized testimony is something that we have a right to appeal. So that’s sort of the argument is sort of the short timeframe. Mary McCord: And I would also just say, that is an interesting legal issue that I think we should spend a few minutes on. Like you mentioned, there’s a bunch of other stuff in here like revisiting the recusal and -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- saying essentially to sentence would mean -- Andrew Weissmann: Fourth time. This is the fourth time. Mary McCord: Yes, exactly. I’m like, please already. That’s another reason. And saying that if the D.A. files a sentencing recommendation that’s public, that would be prejudicial and election interference. Well, the D.A. responds, of course by law, sentencing recommendations are confidential and not made public unless the court makes them public and so on and so forth. So like you said, peel away that detritus. Do I have a legal question that has never been resolved because it’s never come up before because we never had a case like Trump v. United States before and that’s of course what we’ve talked about before and what Judge Merchan now has to decide. Was there such evidence that was introduced at trial at all? And if so, does that mean Trump’s entitled to entirely new trial, or does that mean that evidence could be harmless air? Those are questions that we all have our legal opinions about, but then the real question here is, whatever the ruling is, if it’s not getting rid of the case, which is what Mr. Trump wants, does he have a right to immediately appeal that? And as we talked about -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- usually you appeal after -- Andrew Weissmann: After. Mary McCord: -- sentencing. And we know from the immunity decision that is an exception to getting an ability to appeal during a criminal case. But that is all about appealing before you were even made to go to trial because you’re immune. Here we’re after trial. There’s not an argument he was prosecuted for official acts. The only argument is that evidence of official acts may have been introduced and we had that legal discussion about whether anything that he’s claiming was official really was official. And so it’s just unanswered whether you get any right to appeal that before your sentencing. And I could argue it both ways. Andrew Weissmann: Right, the real issue here is, is there a right to appeal that? Most defendants will say there’s all sorts of errors in their trial. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And by the way, sometimes they may be right -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- that there’s an error, but the way the law works is that’s something that you get to appeal after the trial and after sentencing and then you appeal it and if the court agrees with you, the case could get dismissed or they could go back for a retrial. It could go back for a resentencing. But in terms of the timeline, you don’t get to say, wait a second before sentencing, I want to appeal. So there’s sort of that issue. But Mary, as you noted, because this involves alleged immunized testimony, the question that the Supreme Court has not answered is could you have that interim appeal here? And so that is this open issue. So the D.A. has basically taken sort of a middle road. He didn’t agree with Donald Trump that this sentencing should be put off on the 18th. He didn’t disagree. He basically said, we leave it to you, judge, to make this decision. And he did note, however, that there is this appellate issue. There is this time issue. So he does sort of, to use your phrase, where he gives a sort of permission structure to the judge if he were to say there should be more time, but he doesn’t actually say he wants it or he’s against it. There may be a whole number of political reasons. There may be just a variety of reasons that he doesn’t want to jam up the judge by saying no or yes and say, we defer to you. And by the way, Mary, a lot of times in my career, that’s sort of the right thing. Mary McCord: I agree. I probably would have done the same thing. Andrew Weissmann: There are other times, especially in a high profile matter, where it could be viewed, and I’m not saying it applies here, but when I think about my high profile matters, where it’s not terribly appreciated by the court to have the government saying, hey, you take the heat on this, we’re not going to take a position and we’re going to let everyone yell at you -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- whether it goes forward or not. Here, the D.A. has certainly protected himself from a little bit of the claim of politicization, -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- of a rush. On the other hand, as Nicole Wallace likes to say, who you talking to? I mean, Donald Trump will always say it’s politicized no matter what you do in this. Mary McCord: So this is actually the point kind of that I wanted to bring up while reading these that when you think of it, like I understand D.A. Bragg taking that position because he’s now in a box of if I say, no, you’ve got to go forward for accountability, et cetera, then he’s going to take criticism. And also just in terms of the D.A., they’ve achieved getting 34 guilty verdicts, right, from a jury, so that’s a very successful thing. They’ve shown the world the evidence of what Donald Trump did. So this last piece is the sentencing and I think they would agree and maybe not everyone would agree, but a lot of people would agree that even if given a sentence that would include jail time, a judge probably would allow that to be deferred until after appeal anyway. So they might be thinking, look, the stakes here are such that we’re okay saying, judge, if you think we need to postpone, we’re going to leave that to you, notwithstanding that we don’t think there’s really any merit to the argument about inappropriate admission of official acts testimony at trial. But the problem when you put this whole picture together, when you look at the history of this criminal prosecution, as well as the other three, we talked a little bit about this last week, is you look at how successful Trump has actually been at manipulating the system, right? Andrew Weissmann: Totally. Mary McCord: Like the sentencing was supposed to be July 11th, the trial was supposed to be earlier than it was, right? Then the sentencing got put off. And you know, now he’s put everyone in a box of being able to say this is political when he’s the one who pushed everything up to the very last minute like this through all of his delay tactics. And so it’s deeply unsatisfying to see those tactics work because for other people, you know, people go to trial in criminal cases every day and they don’t have this ability to just put everything off and never have to have true accountability. To me, it really emphasizes sort of the dual system that we have, unfortunately. Andrew Weissmann: I couldn’t agree with you more. Two very quick points. I know a lot of people are probably thinking, well, I think what should be the guiding principle here with respect to Donald Trump is treating him like anyone else, that if this is how anyone else would be treated, he should be treated this way. The problem with that analysis is that, of course that’s true, but there is this open legal issue about when you could -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- appeal and whether it would be something that you could have pre-trial or pre-sentencing or not. And so it’s not an easy thing to apply the rule of treat him like everyone else because it’s treat him like everyone else who has this legal issue. Mary McCord: And no one else has had that, right? Andrew Weissmann: Right. So it does complicate that because my strong inclination is, of course, that, you know what, it doesn’t matter what the ramifications are publicly if he’s being treated like anyone else. That’s a hard issue. The second is I do think the judge has put in a little bit of an unusual situation. He has not ruled yet on the immunity issue and he’s being asked to put off the September 18th date based on an assumption about what will happen on September 16th. And usually judges don’t do that. It’d be like, look, I’m going to rule on September 16th and if you have an application at that point for a delay or an adjournment, I mean, it’s just an odd position to decide now before the ruling that, gee, I need more time because I think, hypothetically -- Mary McCord: Because I think I might need more time. Andrew Weissmann: Right, exactly. It’s sort of like, you know what? It’s somewhat premature in that the party should go ahead and I’m going to be issuing my decision. And for all you know, my decision might be favorable to you. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: In which case, there’s no reason to not have the A team as the next date for doing something. For instance, also the judge could decide he wants to hear evidence. And so there are a lot of things that could happen. So, it’ll be interesting. But just so everyone understands, we do not have a decision from Judge Merchan on this disputed issue or sort of disputed issue. And we should be getting that, I would think, at any moment. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, Mary, why don’t we take a break here and when we return, we are going to hear from Josh Kaplan on his reporting in “ProPublica” focused on America right-wing militia groups and the future dangers of extremists collaborating with law enforcement, politicians, even just acting on their own. We’ll be back with him in a moment. Mary McCord: Yes, let’s do it. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As we mentioned at the top, our guest today is Josh Kaplan. He’s been a reporter at “ProPublica” since 2020. People may be familiar with his byline from recent really blockbuster reporting about the Supreme Court ethical issues for “ProPublica.” I shouldn’t say the Supreme Court as a whole ethical issues, in particular, a couple of Supreme Court justices ethical issues, and that has been ongoing reporting for some time now that has been really, really impactful. He also has reported on the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. He’s reported on the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and many other important subjects. “ProPublica,” of course, does in-depth investigative reporting and he has rightly earned not only a Pulitzer for that reporting, but also a George Polk Award and Edward R. Murrow Award and other awards. But what we have Josh here with us today to talk about is his latest investigative piece. In fact, it’s one that he and I talked about while he was doing that reporting because it’s on a subject that is something that I work on in my day job, my non-podcast job. And that is reporting about a really deep dive into an American militia group. And by militia group, I mean an unlawful private paramilitary organization. The title of this article is “Armed and Underground: Inside the Turbulent Secret World of an American Militia” and we will post a link to that piece in our show notes. So, Josh, as we kick it off here, I do want to make clear that these groups are not lawful, but I’ll save that for a moment. I know what you did here as you dove really deeply into one particular organization. There are many across the country and they’ve sort of existed really since the founding of the country. But this modern militia movement, I would say dates to the ‘90s and in particular things like the Oklahoma City bombing, which of course was not committed by a person who was at that time doing it as part of a militia, but it was committed by somebody, Timothy McVeigh, who had been involved in the militia movement, including being present at Waco and really discussing and being involved in militias for some time, including in his younger years. So just to kind of table set here for our listeners, when you’re talking in this article about militia or paramilitary organization, what are you really talking about? Josh Kaplan: Yeah. I mean, I think loosely speaking, it is these wide variety of groups and their kind of chief shared traits are an emphasis on armed military style training and this sense or belief that they are the last line of defense against the excesses of the government or the excesses of the left. And how those two kind of factors have manifested in terms of the sort of activities they do have changed significantly since the modern movement really started in the early ‘90s. Andrew Weissmann: I wonder, Josh, if you could talk about, because we’re going to spend so much time on their tactics and how they’re going about doing things, and that’s going to get to the legality of what they’re doing, and it’s complicated, but not as complicated as people think as Mary’s going to explained. Mary McCord: I would say it’s not complicated at all, just to interject on that, but we’ll get to that in just a moment. Andrew Weissmann: So I think it’s useful to try to understand what do they want? Is there some unifying thread for what the sort of current militia movement is in terms of what are their goals? Are they seeking political reform? Is it economic? Is it racial? What is it that they want? Josh Kaplan: It’s a fascinating question because it’s harder than you’d think it’d be, because it’s such an unusual thing to go off and join a militia and dedicate an enormous amount of your life to preparing for war, essentially. But for a lot of these militias, including this large militia I was looking at, kind of deliberately, there’s not a clearly defined goal. It’s a very capacious and vague ideology. So the mission statement of this group I was looking at, which has long been one of the largest militias in the United States, is something I’m going off memory here, but resisting all efforts to undermine the Constitution and the American way of life and we will restore America to the glory it once was. And there’s a lot of disagreement amongst the members of this group. Some of them are at least, you know, have significant ties to the white nationalist movement and they’re very upset about anti-white racism. A lot of really common threads are they’re worried about gun control, they’re worried about COVID restrictions, voter fraud, alleged voter fraud. But because, I think, this kind of modern post-Obama form of militias don’t have these very clear mission statements that you might have seen in the earlier days when the white supremacist movement was really the main show in town in terms of far-right extremism. And that allows them to be more flexible, to be able to kind of morph themselves to bring in more people that are in positions of power, whether that’s in law enforcement, in government, and allows them to deal a little bit better with moments of extreme controversy, like we saw on January 6th. Mary McCord: Yeah. And also I do want to make sure listeners are aware that the reason that Josh is not naming this group, I mean, that was at our request. I’ve been studying this long enough, and Josh knows his mission’s a little different when he’s reporting, that all media attention is good media attention, even when it’s got a negative focus. And I know from enough of my own work and my own writing on this issue that naming individuals, leaders, or groups, they love that. It then proliferates on social media, it’s used for recruitment, even if it’s negative. And so the fact is that the group that Josh studied, is really pretty emblematic, I think, of all the groups that I’ve studied in my career and that researchers brief me on pretty regularly about at least every two weeks on what’s happening. So that’s very deliberate on our part. But what Josh has experienced here, I think, shows the arc of what we’ve seen in terms of, you know, again, Timothy McVeigh, the attack on Oklahoma City was an anti-government based attack. And so we’ve seen the ebb and flow of sort of white supremacy as a motivation, even though they’ll often deny it. Christian nationalism, I’d say now, I’d ask you, Josh, if you think that’s kind of now being injected as sort of an overarching ideology. And I think of them as grifters and users. Whatever is the cultural issue of the moment, and particularly a cultural issue being promoted, at least in these last eight years by Donald Trump, is the issue they will grab a hold of and run with for their own purposes, whether it’s recruitment, whether it’s training, organizing, making public statements, et cetera. And so that’s why things like and that’s why we’re having you on this program, because things like the baseless claims of election fraud led, of course, in 2020 to there being not just violence of course on January 6th, but other episodes of violence before and after the election. So, before we move forward, let’s jump back a little bit to fill in this gap here about the rise of militia activity when Barack Obama became president because that is when I think this fear again of the government’s coming to take our guns really spurred a real relaunch of these groups. And it seems like you found that in your reporting as well. Josh Kaplan: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, how this was described to me. I mean, so this was a group that like a lot of the militias you might have heard about in the context of January 6, was founded in Obama’s first term. And at first it was basically an idea on Facebook, let’s make a militia, let’s all join together. But then it went from this kind of paper tiger to something with a real world physical presence relatively quickly. And kind of the impetus for that was they were able to capitalize on some of Obama’s gun control proposals that he started after the Sandy Hook shooting. And how this was described to me by militia leaders was we stopped having to look for people. They started coming to us and we’re having local chapters go from four or five people to more than 200 people in less than a year. And eventually, you know, had an active on-the-ground presence, not just an online presence in almost every state in the United States. Andrew Weissmann: I was wondering if there’s any sense, this is sort of tying what you’ve been talking about and what Mary’s been raising, this issue of how big a problem do we have now? I think for a lot of people, they thought that with the prosecutions of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, that there was this enormous deterrent effect and that this was largely, not entirely, but largely a problem behind us. But do you have a sense of how big a problem do we have now in spite of those prosecutions? Josh Kaplan: Yeah. I mean so, there’s a lot more to say about kind of the aftermath of January 6th and why they were able to overcome that. But I think this deterrence effect ended up being a lot smaller than the people inside the militias were anticipating because they know their history and they know that that’s the sort of thing that could destroy them. But they were able, you know, this militia I was looking at, was able to grow at a really kind of rapid pace in the time since then. And, you know, I think part of the reason that we don’t hear as much about them is they’ve done a good job of keeping their activity more underground. You know, before January 6th, you could tell on Facebook, if you were on the right Facebook groups, you could have some sense that there was something underway. But now they’re being more careful about that sort of operational security. And this group I was looking at, I mean, leaders in it are talking about how this upcoming election that in their view will be decided not at the ballot box, but at the ammo box. They’re talking about how they’re ready to force their way into voting centers if they have to or commit violence, whatever it takes. And also, I mean, I found this kind of eye opening that they have sometimes talked about January 6 as a botched job. The plans weren’t good enough. They didn’t go far enough. And if the militia movement hadn’t been weak, hadn’t been uncommitted, they could have really achieved something that day. And they don’t want to make that mistake twice. Mary McCord: I want to focus particularly on that in our last segment of the episode, but we did skip from sort of a resurgence when Obama became president to current. And I do think it’s important to fill in that block in between there, which you do fill in your story, Josh. And that is when Trump was elected, typically if we look back to the early ‘90s to forward, we would see sort of a difference in popularity and outward demonstrations, for example, of militia activity between administrations, depending, frankly, oftentimes on the politics of it, because there was more of a concern that with a Democrat in the White House, you know, there was going to be gun control. But what was really changed, also, I think, with the election of Donald Trump is a difference in permission structure and groups that have been anti-government suddenly found someone that they thought was on their side, but that someone was himself anti-government. So that’s the piece between sort of Obama administration and where we are now and this involvement in politics and elections. So maybe before the break, if you tell us a little bit about that piece and we’ll come back and focus on the present in our last segment. Josh Kaplan: As I think a lot of people remember from the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, which was when we first really saw this, militias and the broader far right became emboldened after Trump. They had more activity out in the open. I mean, in the Obama years, there were some scary plots that happened that were foiled by the FBI, but really, I mean, these guys spent a lot of their time out in the woods. And the main kind of chief threat of violence was towards federal agents and these sort of standoffs that often happened out West. And in the Trump years, you started seeing a lot more people in the streets, kind of proudly walking around with guns at rallies, gauging in various activities. It wasn’t Trump for the kind of anti-government or anti-government is no longer quite the right word, but this strain of the movement. Trump wasn’t universally a good thing. I think the first three years of Trump’s campaign, it became a little harder for them to recruit and that’s true for a lot of these groups. They were on the downswing. That all changed completely in 2020. COVID hits. All of these conspiracies they feared seemed to be coming true and Trump is legitimizing them. Trump’s tweeting, liberate Michigan, liberate Minnesota. And suddenly you get on this track that carries us through the summer with the protests around the murder of George Floyd. That also is real boon for these groups and they’re very active, patrolling city streets with assault rifles, with baseball bats, getting in violent confrontations with protesters. And then, of course, you have the 2020 election, Trump says it was stolen, and that brings us on this train of violence happening at several protests towards the end of the year, and then eventually January 6th. Andrew Weissmann: This is a good time for us to take a break. And when we come back, one thing that would be useful as we focus on tactics and violence is to maybe do some level setting on what the legal issues are here because I bet you that there are people listening this saying, why don’t we just, not to borrow this phrase, but why are these people not locked up? Why can’t they be prosecuted? What are the lines for bringing criminal accountability in terms of these actions and where do they cross over from legal to illegal? But with that, why don’t we take a break and we can come back and continue this discussion with Josh. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. Well, as Andrew knows, and Josh knows too, because he and I talked quite a while he was reporting his piece. I’m champing, that’s champing, not chomping, at the bit to talk about why this is unlawful. So just to be clear, folks, this is something my organization, my day job, we litigated against unlawful militias after Charlottesville, so that’s why this is something that is such great interest to me. And one of the things, as Josh indicated, that militias, and by that I mean private militia groups, because the only lawful militia is our actually federally and state authorized militias. So we’re talking about the National Guard or other state authorized militia groups that report through the governor, if they can be federalized and report through our U.S. military. It’s the people that sometimes deploy abroad, sometimes are used for disaster relief, for support at the border, things like that, lawful activities by militias that are authorized by the government. That is what a real militia is. Anything else we’re talking about here, whether these private groups of people that get together, that is an unlawful militia, an unlawful paramilitary. And as Josh was indicating, they will say, we stand as a bulwark against a tyrannical federal government or a tyrannical state government and try to claim that was sort of baked into the history of our country and our constitution. But that’s where they’re just so wrong. They’re so wrong historically and textually based on the constitution itself and based on law. So the three points to kick us off of this segment is there is no federal or state authorization for private individuals to group together and form their own militia under their own command. Well-regulated is always meant regulated by the government even since before the founding. Second point, the Second Amendment doesn’t protect them. The Supreme Court has been clear since 1886 in a case called Presser v. Illinois. They upheld anti-militia laws saying these do not violate people’s right to assembly under the First Amendment. They don’t violate people’s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. At that time, the right to bear arms was never imagined to include the right to bear arms for self-defense. That didn’t happen until 2008 when the Supreme Court decided a case called District of Columbia versus Heller, the first case ever to say individuals can bear arms for self-defense, but even in Heller, the court in a decision written by Justice Scalia said, that has nothing to do with paramilitary activity, reaffirmed as holding in press that the Second Amendment does not prevent states from prohibiting private paramilitary groups. And third point is all states, all 50, have either constitutional provisions or state laws that make it clear this is not lawful. The Constitution states -- say that militia shall always be under the control of the government, and other criminal statutes prohibit paramilitary activity, training, and militia activity. So that leads to Andrew’s question. How come there’s so little enforcement? How come they seem to be able to be out there doing their thing in public, heavily armed, often with AR-15s and other assault-style rifles, when this really is not authorized activity? Andrew Weissmann: And also, I would say, what does it mean to be a militia? In other words, we know that you can lawfully own a gun under various circumstances, and obviously there’s a right of assembly. So where is the line between sort of the right of assembly and the right of owning a gun and state laws, whether it’s statutory or constitutional state laws that say you can’t be a militia? Josh Kaplan: I mean, I am the last person to lecture the two of you on constitutional law. My sense from the national security officials I’ve spoken to is one, there’s a hesitancy around what they see as potential either constitutional questions around the First Amendment or simply political backlash that they could receive from Republican politicians if they are going after people who haven’t committed other crimes such as plotting to bomb a mosque. Secondly, I think there is a fear in the FBI that really cracking down on these groups could backfire. And whether or not that’s the right view, I don’t know. But you know, the modern movement was really sparked in the ‘90s by these extremely well-publicized standoffs at Ruby Ridge and at Waco that meant to be law enforcement actions, but as a result, kind of mobilized, really sparked this movement. And I mean, in terms of the sort of activities they do, I mean, just to illustrate the ways that this is different than being in a gun club. I mean, the training is remarkable to watch videos of. It’s a lot of getting together with semi-automatic rifles and practicing storming into a building. Sometimes doing that in pitch black with night vision goggles on. Mary McCord: Which just to be clear is not defensive tactics, right? That is very much an offensive military maneuver. Josh Kaplan: Absolutely. Absolutely. And these are often taught by military veterans who learned it while they were in the armed forces. And so close quarters gun combat indoors, that’s another thing they learn a lot. Using a sniper rifle to hit a target from half a mile away, which is, that’s a tough shot. I think the assassination attempt on Trump was about 150 yards. Mary McCord: Much closer. Josh Kaplan: That’s much, much closer. Mary McCord: Yes, much, much closer. Josh Kaplan: Then there’s the actual activities that they do in the real world, which kind of the standard things are these armed vigilante operations, which the group I was looking at, and I think this is a case for other groups, that’s going to the border and rounding up migrants in these vigilante patrols that the border patrol says is unlawful, although border patrol agents sometimes collaborate with militias that are down there. Similarly, at ballot boxes, trying to crack down on people casting absentee ballots, and during Black Lives Matter protests. Andrew Weissmann: Josh, that might be a really good place because you started to mention at least the makeup of these groups. It might be useful to talk about who are you seeing in these groups and something that you talk about in really superb piece is how they try to infiltrate, recruit people in law enforcement, not just former military or former law enforcement, but actually people who are currently in law enforcement and also the same question and issue with respect to politicians. Josh Kaplan: Yeah, I mean, so there are a lot of veterans, there are a lot of former law enforcement, and I do think the ranks of this group are a little wider than someone might expect for a bunch of people out in the woods. It’s a lot of active duty law enforcement working alongside convicted criminals. It’s people who have successful businesses, active duty military, people that work in the medical field. And really, as you said, I mean, this is viewed as an absolutely crucial goal for them to build alliances with active duty law enforcement for, among other reasons, because these are people that put themselves in extremely volatile situations with guns and they want the cops on their side. They want the cops to see them as friends and there are other reasons to that too. But they have a wide variety of tactics, some of which are like business school-esque marketing schemes. You know, they have these brochures that say in all caps with like five exclamation points, we are not a militia. And they give those to police officers. Internally, the leader of this group said, of course, that’s not true. We all know better. We’re a militia. But this was viewed as a branding decision that might make it so that a cop might feel more comfortable joining or supporting the group. Mary McCord: And wouldn’t you say also a financial because like you showed in your story, and I’ve seen this elsewhere, there’s fundraising online. And so that branding as we are about disaster preparedness and doing food drives and all of these things to sort of normalize their activity, try to fundraise on it, but like you say, the sub rosa, not even that, sub roses, for a militia doing close combat, you know, assault training. Josh Kaplan: Absolutely, and it helps bring in more people. And it’s a helpful line if a police officer in the group gets in trouble, to be able to say, no, that’s not what we do, we do this and this and that. And these are all true. They do these other things. They do do charity drives, but they’re very cognizant and at a certain level, once you get into the chats that are just the leaders, they’re very explicit. Like these are very, very useful things for us to do. Andrew Weissmann: Josh, you’ve talked about Facebook and you’ve talked about their ways of communicating. And I know that there was some effort by social media to sort of crack down on this, but if you could talk about how are they communicating? Josh Kaplan: Yeah, I mean, so a lot of their communications these days are on secure messaging apps. So either Telegram or Signal, which is an encrypted messaging service, which is, you know, it’s less on the open. All these chats that I’m referencing in this story were open only to vetted members of the militia or a lot of the chats were also just for the high level leaders of the militia. I mean, Facebook is a pivotal -- Mary McCord: Yes. Josh Kaplan: -- piece of this whole puzzle. I mean, it was fascinating for me reading these chats that, you know, as scared as they were about the FBI taking the shock and awe approach to arresting people who were participating in the Capitol riot. Really, I think they were more afraid of Facebook. Facebook cracked down on militias at that time, and that was their core recruiting tool. And it wasn’t just that this was just an online group. They then bring people into the real world through Facebook. But that was, as their leader described it, their greatest weapon. And Facebook’s policy hasn’t changed. The group I’m looking at is still, ever since January 6th has been on their list of banned dangerous organizations. But starting in fall 2021, just a few months really after January 6th, they start celebrating that they can recruit on Facebook again and that Facebook, as far as they can tell, has relaxed its controls. And so before long, they were bringing in so many new members that they were really struggling to keep up, as many as 50 new people a day, which does not take very long to become a real force. Andrew Weissmann: When you’re talking about social media just reminds me and its power and its utility in terms of recruiting and fomenting. I mean, that triggered me. Mary McCord: Oh, here we go. Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: With respect to what we were looking at in the Mueller investigation and the use of foreign actors of social media, particularly Facebook, and it’s way too long a topic for this podcast actually. But to me, it is so interesting to see the ways it’s now been used domestically when my first encounter with it was with respect to foreign actors operating here. Mary McCord: I think that’s one of the big lessons from January 6 too when you say, Josh, that before that and before all of the criminal prosecutions, a lot of these groups, if they hadn’t been banned by Facebook, they were operating either on Facebook or in other publicly accessible forums. And then, like you said this earlier, they went kind of more underground after January 6 and started actually having some operational security. And so it’s made your job of course, harder. It’s made law enforcement job harder and everyone because when you’re using end to end encrypted apps and things like that, the planning is not as out in the open as it was. As we wrap up, I really do want to focus on what we’ve got coming up here because your piece highlighted things that many of us paid attention to, but not everybody was aware of that happened during the midterms, which was an early thwarted, but otherwise supposed to be a nationwide effort to really have armed individuals out surveilling ballot drop boxes, voting centers, polling places, et cetera. And because of some early crackdowns, that didn’t really take off. But are you, number one, expecting to see a resurgence of that activity before and on election day this year? And two, what are you thinking about post-election? There’s one other thing I wanna say because there’s another group I work with a lot, Bridging Divides Initiative, and I think you’ve probably talked to them as well, and the Armed Conflict Location Event Dataset, which draws actual activity from the world world, not social media, into trends. And we have seen in this last year, there has been a pretty significant decrease in sort of out of public armed militia activity. But I don’t know about you, but I am worried that could very well end as we get closer to the election and post-election, regardless of who wins. But I’d like your take on that. Josh Kaplan: Yeah. I mean, it’s hard to predict exactly what form it will take, what will happen in this election, certainly. But I mean, when you look at the midterms, I mean, the conspiracy theories promoted by Trump around this they’re like catnip to militia because it’s this idea that elections are being stolen, our country is in mortal peril, and the authorities are either asleep at the wheel or are complicit. And that’s exactly the sort of rubric where they decide we’re going to step in and do this ourselves through vigilante operations. And as you said, in the midterms, this group, they’re very explicit. We’re going to stake out these ballot boxes and we’re going to intimidate people who are dropping off ballots that we think are committing fraud. Could that happen again? I mean, I think absolutely. This is becoming more of a commonplace thing in contemporary elections. And then it’s the aftermath of the election where things I think could get a lot dicier. And I think journalists are notoriously bad at predictions. But I think the most important takeaway here is that we’re still too early to know, is January 6 going to be the peak? Is January 6 going to be this kind of high watermark for militia violence? Are we going to look back on it as a prelude to something even more consequential, to some uptick? And there’s a lot of ways this could go. If Trump loses, this disappointment, a lot of experts I’ve spoken to or government officials I’ve spoken to are worried that that could spark violence either in the immediate aftermath of the election, if Trump again refuses to accept the results, or down the line throughout this administration because these things have often historically these cycles of violence have hinged on presidential election results. And then even if Trump wins, he’s promised he’s going to pardon the January 6 rioters. I think he recently said, oh yeah, I might pardon the ones who assaulted police officers too. And that, people I’ve spoken to are afraid that that could amount to a kind of political hunting license, like get out of jail free card for doing violence for the cause. Even if that’s not what he means, there’s a lot of people with a lot of guns who could interpret it that way. Andrew Weissmann: I have to say the reason that we thought this was such an important topic tied to what we typically do, which is cover primarily the criminal cases against Donald Trump, is that this is because of the concern this is a precursor. We’ve talked a lot about Georgia. We’ve talked a lot about the D.C. criminal cases and that is looking backwards to what happened. That’s what criminal cases are. There’s criminal responsibility for something that happened in the past. But your reporting and the incredible work that Mary does at ICAP is really looking at this forward-looking and thinking about this going forward. I’m going to say something, my last comment on this, which is not optimistic, is when I think about my time in law enforcement, I would read your article and presumably would know a lot of information in addition to that from a whole variety of sources. But human intelligence and electronic intelligence to try to anticipate what is coming up, but the FBI did such a horrendous job in anticipating January 6th, in spite of clear warning signs that I am just very concerned because the leadership of the FBI is the same. There is a different administration at the Department of Justice, but the FBI needs to have a very different attitude to its mission here to make sure that there isn’t a repeat of January 6th because as Mary outlined, what we’re seeing is conduct that does form at the very least a criminal conspiracy. And as Josh, you’ve talked about some activity when you talked about what they actually are not just talking about doing, but actually doing at the border, for instance, those are real criminal actions. And so in addition to being on the radar screen for law enforcement, there has to be a very different mindset at the FBI if we’re not going to see a repeat and we’re not going to have Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, after the facts talking to the public saying, gee, we could use your help in identifying people who committed a crime right outside our backyard. Josh Kaplan: Yeah. The FBI has historically in recent years done a very good job at stopping small sets of people with specific -- Mary McCord: Yes. Josh Kaplan: -- terrorist plots. Mary McCord: Plots, yes. Josh Kaplan: And January 6th, you know, militias were at the forefront of that, according to the Department of Justice. They were leading the charge at every major breach of the Capitol’s defenses. But their plans were, they were inchoate, they were haphazard. This was not a master plan that they perfectly executed, but they played a pivotal role. And that sort of, how do we predict that especially if we get the sort of inflection point and the sort of mass mobilization that a figure like Trump can create very quickly if he issues something that people interpret as a call to arms again, that hasn’t been tested since January 6th really, the law enforcement’s capacity to prepare for and respond to that. Mary McCord: Well, I think that’s all the more reason for you to do the writing and reporting you’re doing, Josh, and us to keep talking about it as well. And, you know, people need to know it’s not lawful. There actually have been some prosecutions at the border of militias there that had no authority and were, you know, detaining migrants unlawfully. But it’s too few and far between and I agree law enforcement needs to be way more proactive this time around to protect everyone’s public safety. But I don’t want anyone to feel like they cannot safely go to the polls or go to ballot drop boxes because there has been so much work done over the last four years to try to make sure that people can safely vote. And that includes what we saw the thwarting of that plan to have surveillance across the country before the midterms. We saw DOJ get involved in one of those cases. So I’m going to do something I don’t always do and end with my glass half full instead of my glass half empty. We’re smarter now and we know more and let’s hope that helps. Josh, it’s been absolutely wonderful having you on. Really, really admire your reporting not only on this, but obviously on many other topics that are very, very important to us, and maybe we’ll be able to have you back sometime. Maybe we’ll be celebrating post-election that none of this came to pass. Andrew Weissmann: Josh, thank you again so much and thank you to “ProPublica.” I really feel like it is having such a moment and such an impact on all of our thinking. And it’s just remarkable, the work that you have done. I mean, talk about punching way above its weight in terms of breaking truly important stories for people to know and follow. Josh Kaplan: Thank you so much. We really appreciate it and really appreciate you having me on. Mary McCord: Thanks so much to Josh Kaplan, a reporter at “ProPublica” since 2020. His piece is called “Armed and Underground: Inside the Turbulent Secret World of an American Militia.” And we’ll post a link to that in our show notes.

Abortion is on the ballot in Arizona after state court ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/abortion-arizona-ballot-court-approves-rcna167534,"Abortion rights will be on the ballot in Arizona this fall after the state supreme court unanimously rejected a challenge that sought to keep voters from deciding whether to enshrine a fundamental right to abortion in the battleground state. Arizona’s top court emphasized that it wasn’t opining on the morality of abortion but rather whether the initiative could appear on the ballot. Arizona Right to Life argued that the description of the measure used to collect signatures to put it on the ballot was so misleading as to invalidate it. The state court rejected that argument in an opinion on Tuesday. The court noted that the measure’s principal provisions are (1) establishing a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution; (2) the scope of that right, before and after fetal viability; and (3) the preclusion of the state from penalizing a person for assisting another in exercising that right. The court said the description wasn’t objectively false or misleading and that it “explains each of these provisions and the tests that would apply to restrictions upon that right.”  The court said the description wasn’t required to explain the initiative’s impact on existing abortion laws or regulations. Noting that state law currently prohibits elective abortions after 15 weeks, the court said that “a reasonable person would necessarily understand that existing laws that fail the prescribed tests would be invalid rather than continue in effect.”  The anti-abortion challengers also argued that the initiative itself is misleading, but the court said that wasn’t the issue in this appeal and that the proper place to argue about that is in the political arena. According to Arizona for Abortion Access, which backed the proposed Arizona Abortion Access Act, or Proposition 139, making abortion a fundamental right would mean that the state can’t limit abortion access before fetal viability without establishing that the limitation (1) is solely to protect the health of the patient, (2) doesn’t infringe on their autonomous decision-making, and (3) uses only the least restrictive means. It further says that the act protects abortion access after fetal viability if a treating healthcare provider determines an abortion is needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the patient, using accepted clinical standards and evidence-based medicine. The state ruling comes as the U.S. Supreme Court, which eliminated federal abortion rights in 2022, is considering an emergency appeal from Republicans to enforce an Arizona law requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote. The justices could act on that appeal anytime.  Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Trump seems to think he has an airtight defense for visiting a KKK hotbed in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:04 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-howell-michigan-kkk-white-supremacists-rcna167460,"Donald Trump’s appearance in Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday sparked controversy before he even arrived. That’s because the visit continued his notable tradition of scheduling campaign stops in locations known as hotbeds for racist extremism. Just last month, a group of white supremacists marched in Howell and expressed their support for Trump and Adolf Hitler. As journalist Jon King wrote for the Michigan Advance, the event evoked memories of Howell’s racist — and in some cases, fairly recent — history of public bigotry and the Ku Klux Klan. So this was certainly a peculiar location for Trump to host a rally — especially when you consider that he has said nothing about the white supremacist gathering there in July and that he has a history of similar scheduling controversies. Last year, for example, he held a rally in Waco, Texas, shortly after the 30th anniversary of the deadly standoff between Branch Davidians (aka cultists) and law enforcement. Trump’s speech at that rally, in which he vowed “I am your retribution,” definitely gave off David Koresh vibes. And in 2020, Trump reversed course and rescheduled a planned Juneteenth rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where in 1921 white mobs waged one of the deadliest race riots in history — killing as many as 300 Black people. As a matter of fact, Trump is set to speak Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, where members of a pro-Trump chapter of the KKK sought to hold a cross-burning in 2017. But Trump seems to think he found an airtight defense for his Michigan visit. When a reporter on Tuesday asked about his response to criticism over his visit, he responded with a question of his own: “Who was here in 2021?” The answer he was fishing for — and received — was “Joe Biden.” Of course, the big difference is that the president wasn’t visiting right after racists praised him and Hitler simultaneously. In a statement, the Harris-Walz campaign slammed Trump for his refusal “to condemn the white supremacists who marched in his name.” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat whose district includes Howell, was critical as well, writing on X that Trump “didn’t come to Howell today to bring people together, to call out that hateful behavior, or to offer any kind of hopeful vision for the future.” She said the visit “risks reopening old wounds” and added: “Real leaders should take the opportunity to condemn the hatred that has been on display.” I’ll note that one simple way for Trump to dissociate from the racists in Howell might have been for him to avoid doing anything that suggests he shares the same bigoted ideology. But unfortunately for him, at one point Tuesday he seemed to openly fantasize about deploying the police at election time, harkening back to periods of unfettered displays of white supremacy in the U.S. Methinks the Howell visit might not be entirely coincidental."
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.21.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-82124-rcna167568,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Florida, former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell easily won her Democratic U.S. Senate primary this week, setting up a potentially interesting contest against far-right Sen. Rick Scott. The Republican incumbent also faced nominal primary opposition, which posed little challenge. * Speaking of the Sunshine State, Politico reported that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ attempt to elect conservative school board members across Florida hit a snag this week, “as candidates backed by the Republican governor fell in several key races.” * Montana’s secretary of state has now certified an abortion rights ballot measure, putting the issue on the state’s November ballot. In addition to the obvious medical and legal implications, the development might also have a broader electoral impact: Montana is home to a closely watched U.S. Senate race, and the more reproductive rights proponents vote in the fall, the better it will probably be for incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. * NBC News reported that the first night of the Democratic National Convention drew an estimated 20 million viewers, which exceeds the 18 million viewers who watched the first night of last month’s Republican National Convention. * The Washington Post reported that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and the Democratic National Committee “raised three times as much as Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee in July, and ended the month with a cash advantage that positions the newly minted Democratic presidential nominee to air more ads and maintain a larger payroll than her Republican opponent in the final months of the race for the White House.” * Though we haven’t heard much lately about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his considerable wealth, Bloomberg appears to have cut a $10 million check for the House Democrats’ largest super PAC. * And there’s reason anew to wonder about the future of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign: The conspiracy theorist’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said their campaign faces a choice between continuing with its ill-fated effort — which would “risk” helping Harris — or dropping out to “join forces” with Trump.

Republican voices make a splash at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 8:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-voices-make-splash-democratic-convention-rcna167558,"By any fair measure, the number of Republicans and conservative figures who’ve endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris is an incredible symbolic victory for the Democratic ticket. Harris and her allies are eager to reach voters beyond their party’s base, and the more support the vice president picks up from the other side of the partisan divide, the better it’ll be for her candidacy. But as the Democratic National Convention is making clear, Democrats are doing more than just thinking about the symbolism, and Team Harris isn’t just relegating her Republican proponents to names on a page. On the contrary, as NBC News reported, some prominent GOP voices were invited onto the convention stage. “I saw him when the cameras were off, behind closed doors. Trump mocks his supporters. He calls them basement dwellers,” she said. Grisham went on to share an anecdote about a Trump visit to a hospital during the Covid crisis. “He was mad that the cameras were not watching him. He has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,” she said. “He used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’ But it does matter — what you say matters, and what you don’t say matters.” The comments were striking, but so too were the broader circumstances: Trump’s former White House press secretary addressed the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to elect Trump’s Democratic rival. To put this in perspective, imagine Karine Jean-Pierre getting a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in 2028. What’s more, Grisham wasn’t alone. Four Republicans addressed the Democratic convention on its second night, including Mesa Mayor John Giles and Ana Navarro, a Republican co-host of the “The View”; and former Rep. Adam Kinzinger is still scheduled to appear this week. If there are some on-the-fence GOP voters who aren’t quite sold on their party’s scandal-plagued nominee (Nikki Haley voters, I’m looking in your direction), Harris and her party are clearly extending an outreached hand."
"Reality gets in the way of Trump’s line on crime, law enforcement",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 7:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/reality-gets-way-trumps-line-crime-law-enforcement-rcna167545,"Donald Trump and his campaign team apparently had a simple plan: The former president would go to Michigan and talk about crime, which is an issue the Republican sees as electoral strength, despite his criminal record. The trouble, of course, is that reality got in the way of the pitch. The Trump campaign, for example, had told The Detroit News that the GOP candidate would agree to an interview, but as the newspaper reported, after the News “began asking about the Michigan crime data before the event, a campaign aide said the presidential candidate no longer had time for an interview.” Imagine that. Trump declared in Michigan that there’s an ongoing “crime wave” that’s reached levels “nobody has ever seen before.” He was, of course, lying: Though crime rates spiked toward the end of his failed presidency, the United States has seen a dramatic turnaround in recent years. When Team Trump came to realize that the Detroit News might ask the former president to contend with the truth, a scheduled interview opportunity quickly disappeared. The Republican clearly preferred to bask in his alternate reality. In big cities “almost all run by Democrats,” Trump added, “you can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot. You get mugged. You get raped. You get whatever it may be.” This was demonstrably ridiculous. Trump obviously didn’t care — and it wasn’t the only lie he peddled during the event. But stepping back, the larger point of the event was apparently to position the GOP candidate as an ally of law enforcement. Indeed, Trump spoke at the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office surrounded by deputies in uniform, in front of parked police SUVs. After the remarks, he posted an item to his social media platform with the words “BACK THE BLUE” superimposed over his photograph. The point, obviously, was to suggest to voters that Trump is aligned with law enforcement. But just as actual crime rates get in the way of the former president’s campaign pitch, Trump’s record gets in the way of his alliance with the police. Consider the newly revised list of The Top 10 Reasons Donald Trump Deserves To Be Seen As An Opponent Of Law Enforcement. 10. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and accused law enforcement officials of pushing “fake” crime rate statistics as part of a political plot to help Democrats. 9. A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies, and he’s still facing dozens of other criminal counts across multiple jurisdictions. 8. Trump is facing civil suits from police officers who sustained injuries during the Jan. 6 riot the Republican instigated. 7. Trump has condemned common law enforcement tools, including plea agreements for witnesses who cooperate with prosecutors. 6. Trump abused his powers by intervening in criminal cases in which the defendants were political allies, letting politically connected suspects go free — even after some pleaded guilty — and undermining law enforcement in the process. 5. Trump has undermined law enforcement by abusing his pardon powers, in one case even commuting the sentence of a man accused of helping murder of a police officer. 4. Trump lashed out at the police officer who shot Ashli Babbitt as a “thug” and a “coward” who deserves to be vilified. 3. Trump has promised day-one pardons for insurrectionists, many of whom violently clashed with police officers. 2. While in office, Trump saw law enforcement as a political weapon he can wield at his convenience, which led him to urge law enforcement officials to enforce his political vendettas and help Republicans win elections. 1. Trump has expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a sycophantic supporter of the former president, recently declared via social media, “No one Backs The Blue more than President Trump.” There’s ample evidence to the contrary.

This AI chief says being over 50 is her secret weapon. Here’s why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 6:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/ai-chief-says-50-secret-weapon-s-rcna167493,"It might seem like science fiction, but in the era of rapid AI development, the rise of “robotic co-workers” is real and projected to become a nearly $40 billion global market over the next decade. But humans, do not fear. At the helm of that industry — with a mission to separate fact from fiction — is Peggy Johnson, CEO of Agility Robotics. In March, she took over the Oregon-based startup that has raised $180 million in venture financing, according to Forbes. At 62, Johnson oversees the development of humanoid robots — machines that stand as tall as a person, have a head, two arms and two legs — engineered to maneuver freely and work alongside humans in warehouses to fulfill dull, repetitive tasks, like moving products onto conveyors. While the demand for this bipedal bot, called Digit, has skyrocketed in industrial manufacturing, the intent isn’t to displace human workers at all, but rather make them more productive. For her work in this brave new world of robotics and AI, Johnson was recently honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s 4th annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list this month, in the innovation category. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. As far as Johnson is concerned, her age is her greatest asset. “I have this plethora of experiences that one has built on the other, that’s built on the other, through several companies and I couldn’t have done that in a compacted amount of time,” Johnson told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. “I had to live by the way through the highs and lows of different projects and different company cycles — all of that is cumulative to the experience I bring today in my current role — so it’s absolutely an advantage and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Johnson’s career in tech leadership began when she joined Microsoft in 2014 as Satya Nadella’s first hire. She made a name for herself as the company’s “chief dealmaker” when she spearheaded Microsoft’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. During the pandemic, she led augmented reality company Magic Leap. But there was a time when she never envisioned a career in the tech and engineering fields. That all changed in a single day over a fluke conversation she had in college. “I went off to San Diego State and … I had a [mail delivery] job on campus because I was putting myself through college,” she recalled to McGrath. “I walked into the engineering department one day to deliver mail and the two administrative assistants behind the desk thought I was there to learn about engineering. I said, ‘Nope, just here to deliver mail,’ and they said, ‘Well, do you know anything about engineering?’” That exchange sparked a bigger conversation. “I had no idea what an engineer did in their profession, and so they sat me down and walked me all through the different types of engineering that I could go into. At the end of the conversation, they pushed the papers across the table to change my major. So, that night I filled it out, came in the next day and became an engineering major.” With a newly-minted degree in electrical engineering, Johnson landed a job at San Diego tech company, Qualcomm, where she spent 25 years, eventually becoming the company’s executive vice president and head of global market development. When she later joined Microsoft as the executive vice president of Business Development, she cemented her reputation as one of the world’s most notable women in engineering. In fact, Business Insider lauded her as the “#1 Most Powerful Female Engineer"" in 2017. But that level of success didn’t come without its own set of challenges, especially as a woman in a highly male-dominated industry. “My biggest learning of my entire career was just to be myself because as I went on to my next job and did not have a female manager, I was oftentimes criticized during performance reviews for not speaking up enough in meetings,” she told Mcgrath. “It became a detriment to my upward mobility in these companies and I thought, well, maybe I’ll try and be that person they want me to be. I tried to be louder in meetings. One day I even hit my hand on the table and said, ‘I want to speak!’ and they looked at me startled, and said, ‘What’s wrong with Peggy?’” Johnson’s manager at the time stepped in. “I wasn’t myself for sure and then my manager said, ‘You know what, you just be yourself and that will carry us through.’ And he was right, that actually gave me the confidence to be the introvert that I was. I did communicate, but not always in a big meeting. I would go to someone’s office or I’d call them or send an email … I was getting my point across and he helped others recognize that.” Johnson credits her leadership style today to that authenticity, as well as her ability to hear other points of view — something she learned as a child growing up in a large family. “I’m one of 15 [and] being the second to the youngest … I was a big listener. And it was hard anyway to get a word in edgewise at our family dinner table,” she told McGrath. “And so I became a listener and that has been one of the areas that I was able to leverage in my management roles over the years and then my CEO roles.” Johnson herself has raised three children with her husband, Eric, who she met in the very same college engineering department that changed the course of her life four decades ago. Given the trajectory of her long career, Johnson had this advice for younger women who feel the rush to accomplish their career goals early on: “Don’t feel the need to do that.” “To make sure to sequence in all of those parts of your life — your work life, your partner, your children, your activities — all of those things are important to us as individuals and you can really abandon those if your only goal is getting ahead,” she told McGrath. “We all have to have that well-rounded part of our lives, because that makes us the person that we are, and if we’re ignoring those parts of our lives and just become the workaholic, I think it actually holds you back.”"
"As Gaetz wins Florida primary, McCarthy’s ‘revenge tour’ falters",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 6:38 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gaetz-wins-florida-primary-mccarthys-revenge-tour-falters-rcna167527,"After former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was stripped of his gavel, prompting the California Republican to ultimately resign from Congress, he put aside talk of a possible comeback bid. Rather, McCarthy’s short-term focus was on the 2024 election cycle and a plan to target the GOP members who were responsible for ending his career on Capitol Hill. The strategy quickly became known as the former House speaker’s “revenge tour.” It’s also become McCarthy’s latest failure. NBC News reported: As NBC News’ report added, a McCarthy-aligned super PAC invested $3.5 million on ads against Gaetz, emphasizing the incumbent congressman’s many scandals. It didn’t work: The latest vote tallies suggest Gaetz won his primary by roughly 45 points. This was not, in other words, a squeaker. McCarthy and his allies tried to bring down the former speaker’s intraparty bête noire, and they failed spectacularly. Making matters worse, it was the latest in a series of 2024 setbacks. McCarthy’s revenge tour targeted Rep. Nancy Mace in South Carolina, and she won her primary easily. McCarthy also targeted Rep. Eli Crane in Arizona, and he won his primary easily. As part of the same revenge tour, Team McCarthy eyed Rep. Tim Burchett in Tennessee, too, but that didn’t go anywhere. It’d be an overstatement to say the former speaker’s efforts were a complete flop — McCarthy and his allies targeted House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good in Virginia, and the incumbent narrowly lost in a GOP primary earlier in the summer — but it was the only stop on the revenge tour that went well. In each of the other contests, McCarthy and his political operation raised millions of dollars, only to come up empty. The Republican’s tenure as speaker was embarrassing, but it now appears that his second act wasn’t much better. As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones explained in June, “This ‘revenge tour’ by McCarthy was supposed to show his power as an independent force in Republican politics. So far, it’s shaping up to be a reflection of his weakness and political irrelevance.”"
"Barack, Michelle Obama cut Donald Trump down to size at DNC",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 5:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/barack-michelle-obama-cut-donald-trump-size-dnc-rcna167516,"When Democrats make a case against Donald Trump, they tend to focus on many of the former president’s worst qualities. The party and its officials eagerly remind voters that the Republican is dangerous and radical, dishonest and corrupt, ignorant and hateful. The assessments, of course, are rooted in fact. But one of the striking things about the respective Democratic National Convention speeches from Michelle and Barack Obama was their willingness to make a different kind of case against the GOP nominee: Trump, the Obamas effectively argued, is small and tiresome. From the former first lady’s remarks: Subtle, it was not. To be sure, both of the Obamas spent the bulk of their speeches touting the incumbent vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the Democratic ticket’s vision, but some of the most memorable parts of their remarks were their takedowns of the Republican candidate. “For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” the former first lady added. “See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black. I want to know, who’s going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs? “It’s his same old con. Doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better. “Look, because cutting our health care, taking away our freedom to control our bodies, the freedom to become a mother through I.V.F., like I did — those things are not going to improve the health outcomes of our wives, mothers and daughters. Shutting down the Department of Education, banning our books — none of that will prepare our kids for the future. Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love, look, that doesn’t make anybody’s life better. Instead, instead, it only makes us small. And let me tell you this: Going small is never the answer. Going small is the opposite of what we teach our kids. Going small is petty. It’s unhealthy. And quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.” If there was a time when Michelle Obama pulled her punches, that time has passed. Her husband’s assessment dovetailed nicely with hers. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago,” the former president said. “It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that’s actually been getting worse now that he is afraid of losing to Kamala. There’s the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. It just goes on and on and on. The other day, I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day.” When Obama referenced Trump’s weird obsession with crowd sizes, pay particular attention to what he did with his hands: “Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided: between us and them, between the real Americans who, of course, support him and the outsiders who don’t,” Obama added. “And he wants you to think that you’ll be richer and safer if you will just give him the power to put those other people back in their place. It is one of the oldest tricks in politics, from a guy whose act has — let’s face it — gotten pretty stale. We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.” As eviscerations go, the Obamas weren’t just pitch-perfect, they also delivered remarks that won’t soon be forgotten."
"Tim Walz was my favorite teacher. He’ll be an exceptional vice president, too.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-teacher-politics-kamala-harris-2024-election-rcna166464,"The country is taking a crash course to get to know Tim Walz. You may be learning about his record as governor of Minnesota in his second term. Maybe you recall his 12 years as a Democratic congressman representing a conservative district where he was ranked the 88th most bipartisan congressman and focused on veterans’ and farmers’ issues. Maybe you’re learning about his 24-year service to our country in the National Guard.  I’ve known Gov. Walz as Mr. Walz. I was fortunate to have Mr. Walz as my global geography teacher at Mankato West High School in 2005. I also have the distinction of being the last class Mr. Walz taught before switching careers and going to Washington, D.C. For those not familiar with Mankato, it’s a small farming community in southern Minnesota nestled in a river valley about 90 miles from St. Paul and Minneapolis. It’s also about 60 miles north of Iowa. We are known for being the soybean-crushing capital of the world, as well as for our stone products. Teachers and coaches play a significant role in our lives, and a great teacher can change the lives of students and athletes. Think of your favorite teacher or coach. What traits did they have? Likely they inspired you; they made you feel hope that tomorrow will be better than today, are invested in their students’ future, teach us how to overcome obstacles, help us see the potential within ourselves, and ultimately inspire us to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be. These are the traits that Mr. Walz embodies. Mr. Walz is the kind of person who brings joy to everything he does. The smiles and energy you see on the campaign trail are as real now as they were over 20 years ago in a high school classroom. Mr. Walz’s enthusiasm is contagious, making it hard not to pay attention when he speaks. He is kind, genuine and authentic — qualities that not only make him an excellent teacher but are also much needed in politics.  I wasn’t a top student in high school, but Mr. Walz treated me with the same dedication and effort he gave to my more successful classmates. This commitment inspired me. Mr. Walz also got us thinking about the world at large. We actively discussed issues such as the genocide in Cambodia and the Holocaust, and how Muslim women were treated in France after the government banned religious symbols from public schools in 2004. Once a week, Gov. Walz offered an extra credit assignment. Students would have to come prepared to discuss a recent news event for 30 to 60 seconds, and you couldn’t repeat a story another classmate had already used. This exercise made us realize just how big the world really is; suddenly the world moved beyond the walls of my Mankato classroom. Mr. Walz’s approach to the classroom made you want to be actively a part of the broader world. Almost a decade after graduating from Mankato West High School. I ran for a Duluth City Council seat, won and served six years. This is partly due to Mr. Walz; his service to our country through the National Guard and Congress, but also his dedication to my local community as a teacher and a high school football coach.  Mr. Walz made politics feel accessible. He made me believe that someone who doesn’t come from family money, isn’t Ivy League-educated and isn’t a lawyer, can still run for office, win and make a positive impact on your community and country. It’s not every day that your favorite high school teacher has the chance to be the next vice president of the United States; you would have to go back over 50 years to Lyndon Johnson.  I am incredibly proud of Mr. Walz, all he has accomplished, and how he has gone about accomplishing it: by being joyful, authentic, caring and genuine in all that he does."
Tim Walz once asked me an important question. It changed the course of my life.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-teacher-writer-harris-2024-election-rcna166815,"We need people in the White House who are curious about other points of view. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is one of those people. In the late 1990s, Mr. Walz was my global geography teacher at Mankato West High School in Minnesota. I’ll never forget sitting in his class as he passionately delivered his lesson of the day. Mr. Walz didn’t simply stand at the front of the room and talk at his students. He gestured. He paced. He asked us questions. Our high school didn’t have air conditioning, and you knew it had been a lively class when sweat lined Mr. Walz’s brow by the time the bell rang. The guy never stopped moving. He made us excited to learn about the world beyond our small town. Mr. Walz shared many of his experiences with us, from growing up in Nebraska to serving in the National Guard. (I recall the day he explained why he often spoke so loudly. He had some hearing loss from his time in the Guard.) Before coming to Minnesota, Mr. Walz had spent time teaching in China. He shared his experiences there and even taught us a bit of Pinyin, the Chinese phonetic system that uses the Latin alphabet. During one particularly memorable class, Mr. Walz and another student were quietly arguing at the front of the room. The argument escalated until the student shoved his desk. Mr. Walz sent the student to the principal’s office. The rest of us sat in silent shock — until the student came back into class with a grin on his face. Mr. Walz admitted they had staged the whole “argument.” He then asked each of us to write an account of what had happened. We all remembered the incident slightly differently. He taught us a valuable and powerful lesson on perspective, memory and eyewitness testimony. But it wasn’t the most powerful lesson I learned from Mr. Walz. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to be a writer. Junior year, I signed up for the creative writing class. During the poetry unit, each of us wrote a poem on a giant sheet of paper and hung it in the second-floor hallway. My poem was about shyness. Those who knew me back then wouldn’t be surprised by my choice of subject. I was shy and quiet yet bursting with ideas and opinions. But I was often too afraid to voice them. Writing was a natural outlet for me. (It still is.) After I hung up my poem, I decided it wasn’t quite finished. I grabbed a marker and added a stand-alone line along the bottom that read: “Sometimes people who don’t speak have the most to say.” A few students complimented my poem. A senior on the basketball team even said it was her friend’s new favorite poem. As a young writer, receiving that positive feedback was thrilling. One day, I was at my locker when Mr. Walz approached me. He had read my poem and was curious about the final line I had added. “Is that true?” he asked me. “About people who don’t talk much having a lot to say?” Mr. Walz was one of the most popular teachers at school. He was outgoing and friendly to everyone. And he seemed genuinely interested in a point of view I don’t think he’d given a lot of thought to until he read my words. Perhaps he also knew I needed someone to acknowledge that quiet students have value, too. Mr. Walz was the only teacher at school who asked me about my poem. We had a good chat, and his interest in my perspective stuck with me long after I graduated. Over the years, I’ve had a handful of teachers who encouraged me to keep writing, in ways big and small. Mr. Walz was one of those teachers. Character and curiosity matter. They matter at home, at school, in our communities, and in our government. Tim Walz has these qualities in spades."
Tim Walz embodies the Midwestern values that conservatives never talk about,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/celebrate-tim-walz-midwestern-dad-memes-rcna167422,"I like to joke that I’ve only ever lived in the colon of the country. From Texas to South Dakota to Minnesota, now Iowa — the states where people say they are from but rarely ever move to. When I tell people where I live, after getting Iowa confused with Ohio, they ask me why I don’t just move. Why don’t I leave? Why don’t I get the hell out where I could maybe get some reproductive rights? What about my kids? People used to be able to say that Iowa was a good place to raise kids. But with my state’s disinvestment from public schools, the book bans and attacks on trans kids, you can’t say that anymore. The people who love it here tell me to leave, too, because I’ve made a career of writing about the problems with this state. In picking Tim Walz as her running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris seems to be sending a message to flyover places: that we aren’t forgotten.  Walz is a man who exudes an authentic Midwestern ethos. His rounded vowels and softened consonants are not a put on. Unlike the thousands of politicians who come to the Midwest to talk agriculture policy, roll up flannel sleeves, stand in front of a hay bale for a picture and then get the hell out, Walz is from places people write off. Having grown up in Nebraska, Walz moved to rural Minnesota and worked as a teacher at Mankato West High School. His wife, Gwen, and I attended the same small rural college that no one outside the twin cities or Lutheran Church culture has ever heard of. Walz is the Midwestern dad of memes. Slapping his thighs and saying “whelp,” wearing camo not because he’s cosplaying, but because he actually likes to hunt. And it’s important that he is  Midwestern, because like being middle class, being Midwestern is a self-designated identity marker of normalcy. This land is the middle of two coasts, pulled in between the perceived extremes, and it’s become a metaphor for American values.  The Midwest has many competing identities: First Nations, white settlers, the waves of immigrants who found a home here. And sometimes when someone will say something like, “Oh, Chicago is not Midwestern,” what they really mean is that it’s too diverse to fit their definition of the whiteness of this place.  But if definitions can exclude, they can also include. This land is a closed fist sometimes, but it can also be an open hand.  Walz’s history as governor is not one of exclusion; it’s one of openness, welcome and inclusivity. Walz’s entire identity is what we think of when we think of the average American, but his politics are radically inclusive. And, as such, he offers a different vision of what this country can be. His policies, which include giving kids free school lunch and offering paid parental leave, being vehemently pro-reproductive rights and LGBTQ reflect, not the bitter-chip-on-the-shoulder-own-the-libs politics that the Midwest has been defined by during the Trump era, but a generous and expansive political vision that harkens back to Paul Wellstone, Tom Harkin and Tom Daschle. Pundits like to write off this region, but recent progressive wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas show that this land is more complicated than it looks when you simply fly over it or look at it on an electoral map. Walz himself has decried the reductivist thinking of red state/blue state maps, in 2023 noting, “We need to find the first person who put that red-blue map up and beat the hell out of them for putting that on, because it divided the country.” He is right. The value of a land should not be decided on its politics. Right after an inland hurricane tore through my town and people were struggling for help, a common refrain on social media was, “That’s what you get for voting for Republicans.” As if the accidents of birth geography, and the intentional segregation of gerrymandering and voter suppression, meant people should suffer. I saw people saying similarly dismissive things after the energy crisis in Texas, and people will be saying it as Floridians suffer in the wake of its most recent hurricane. It’s a cruel calculation. One that equates politics with virtue and virtue with worthiness. But the reality is people need help simply because they are people. And if this election is about who gets to define this country and who gets to be defined, picking Walz makes sense. He’s an older white man and he is out there calling Trump and Vance “weird” — aberrations from the norm — and that critique means something coming from him, a white male governor from a Midwestern state. A region so often mocked for its blandness that the blandness, like the Miracle Whip in the potato salads, becomes a binding agent — a cohesiveness we very much need in the vastness and complexity of America.

Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-howell-michigan-speech-crime-rcna167365,"Former President Donald Trump stood before the media on Tuesday afternoon to lie about crime. This isn’t the first time he has fabricated fictions about violent immigrants streaming across the border or cities under an onslaught of criminally violent minorities, crumbling pillars of the Republican case against Vice President Kamala Harris. But it was the setting, outside the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office in Howell, Michigan, that infused his rambling with an even darker undertone than normal. I don’t remember when I first learned about Howell’s association with the Ku Klux Klan. I’m not a native of Michigan; my family moved there the year I turned 12. But by the time I was in college, it was a readily understood “joke” among my friends that there’d be no stopping for gas in Howell if I was in the car. I would stare at the signage on the interstate as we’d cruise past, grateful the tank was nowhere near empty. In the 1970s and ’80s, at the peak of the city’s links to the white supremacist movement, Robert Miles, the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, had a Howell mailing address and was known to hold rallies on a nearby farm property. Black residents of nearby Detroit knew full well not to set foot in the town, a belief that — if it hasn’t expired — lasted at minimum deep into the early 2000s. The city has worked hard to shake that association with hate movements, a project that was damaged last month during a previous Trump visit to Michigan. Though the campaign rally held that day was across the state in Grand Rapids, a small group of masked white supremacists marched through downtown Howell chanting “Heil Hitler.” Later that day, another demonstration was held on a highway overpass, featuring a swastika flag and people chanting, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” I want to stress that this was only a dozen or so racists and that the city’s officials don’t support the hatefulness that was displayed. “Although we recognize their right to free speech, these demonstrators do not reflect the values of the Howell community,” the city said in a statement at the time. But it’s not a stretch to say that the men who gathered that day knew the significance of the location they’d picked. Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy tried to de-emphasize the matter in a Facebook post ahead of Trump’s visit. “Within the last month, there’s been a couple of folks that have come here to cause a little bit of a stir, spew some hate speech, white supremacy crap,” he said in the video. He also denied that Trump’s appearance was meant to be a political event, calling it a “press conference,” instead. Notably, though, Trump didn’t take a single question from the assembled reporters after delivering his remarks, which sounded like his usual stump speech sprinkled with a few dodgy statistics. I’ve been unable to figure out whose figures he was supposedly citing when he claimed that crime had spiked since Vice President Kamala Harris took office. In reality, we’ve seen major declines in violent crime since a peak in 2020, both across the country and especially in Detroit. But the supposed statistics he was offering were less important than the rhetoric surrounding them. This was an audience that Trump wanted to hear this particular diatribe. Like his presidency, Trump’s presidential campaigns have always been in a constant state of dissonance between a claimed respect for law and order and a flagrant flouting of the rule of law. He has been quick to sidle up to the police and stoke their belief that any mention of accountability is a grave attack upon them. In speaking with Murphy and several deputies standing behind him, Trump clearly sought to project strength to a sympathetic audience who would accept his entirely vibes-based argument that there’s a “Kamala crime wave.” The thing is, though, that’s a point that Trump could have made standing in front of SUVs emblazoned with a sheriff’s logo in any small town in any swing state in the country. Howell’s history, both long-term and recent, sets it apart. The same could be easily said about Trump’s decision to hold a rally in Waco, Texas, to defend the Jan. 6 rioters. It was likewise similar to presidential candidate Ronald Reagan’s choice in 1980 to give a speech about state’s rights at the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi. Neshoba is the county where civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney had been kidnapped and murdered 16 years earlier. Reagan made the deliberate choice to speak there to win over lingering segregationists in the state. There is no world in which Trump’s team didn’t understand the significance of holding that event in Howell. That he did so is to the great detriment of the people who have worked to show they now outnumber the cowards who chanted antisemitic comments and expressed support for Trump from behind masks last month. Howell is not the place it was in the 1970s and ’80s — but as we saw last month, there are people who hope that it can be again if Trump is returned to leadership. They chanted, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” Trump hasn’t even condemned them."
Michelle Obama understands the stakes in November. And she’s done pulling punches.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 9:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/michelle-obama-dnc-speech-democratic-convention-rcna167484,"The woman who so many people wanted to draft to run for president — the author and speaker who enchanted a whole generation of women and helped us understand where we belong in modern society — began her speech Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention talking about feelings.  Former first lady Michelle Obama spoke of the magical feeling in the air, the power of grief and the sense that as a country we can be better than what we have been.  Michelle talked us through the national trauma we experienced under former President Donald Trump — “the dimming of our light” and how Trump’s continued pursuit of power gives a “palpable sense of dread about our future.” And then she reminded us that hope is still alive. Sitting in the convention audience once again, Michelle spoke to me more personally. Eight years ago, I was massively pregnant with my first child and optimistic that women were going to shatter the thickest glass ceiling of all. We have all experienced a lot of life since the moment when the former first lady reminded us that “when they go low, we go high.”  One global pandemic, a domestic insurrection and dozens of personal crises later, Michelle spoke to women across the country to remind us of the power we share, a power rooted in our connections to one another.  It isn’t “enough for our kids to thrive while everyone is drowning,” she said, and I am reminded of the father who turned back in the roiling Rio Grande to try to rescue his 2-year old daughter, only for them both to drown. Kids in cages and stories of children dying in the Middle East are no longer policy problems to wrangle; I am now more than a diplomat and policy wonk — I am a woman and a mother who sees my hopes and dreams in other people, too. Michelle reminded us that Vice President Kamala Harris’ story is “my story, our story,” and she’s right. Our mothers — mine in Pakistan, Michelle’s in Chicago, Kamala’s in India — vast oceans and cultures apart — had been single-minded in telling their daughters to “do something” and lift up the people around us. Michelle gave us a way to heal and laugh, not by going low but by going in hard, using Trump’s insecurities and insults against him, reminding everyone that before Trump was in the White House, the presidency was, indeed, “one of those Black jobs.” She called out Trump for trying the “same old con” of racism and misogyny and noted how the rest of us don’t have the benefit of generational wealth and skating around multiple bankruptcies.  And Michelle gave all of us who have been heartbroken by our disconnected communities, by the smallness of people like Trump continuing to seek power, a way to fight back without going low because “our mothers taught us better than that.” “This is the time to stand up for what we know in our hearts and minds we know is right. ... This is the time to do something.” And to those dragging their feet, Michelle said, “There is no time for that kind of foolishness!”  Yes, indeed, America, hope is making a comeback. And that feeling of hope will turn into action because of the fighting power of women."
Read Michelle Obama's full DNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 8:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/read-michelle-obama-full-dnc-speech-rcna167490,"This is a lightly edited version of Michelle Obama's prepared Democratic National Convention remarks, delivered on Aug. 20. Hello Chicago!  Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it?  Not just here in this arena, but spreading all across this country we love; a familiar feeling that’s been buried too deep for too long.  You know what I’m talking about?  It’s the contagious power of hope!   The anticipation, the energy, and the exhilaration of once again being on the cusp of a brighter day.  The chance to vanquish the demons of fear, division, and hate that have consumed us, and continue pursuing the unfinished promise of this great nation — the dream that our parents and grandparents fought and died and sacrificed for.  America, hope is making a comeback! To be honest, I’m realizing that until recently, I have mourned the dimming of that hope.   Maybe you’ve experienced the same feelings: a deep pit in my stomach; a palpable sense of dread about the future.  And for me, that mourning has been mixed with my own personal grief.  The last time I was in Chicago was to memorialize my mother, the woman who showed me the meaning of hard work, humility, and decency — who set my moral compass high and showed me the power of my voice.   I still feel her loss so profoundly. I wasn’t even sure I’d be steady enough to stand before you tonight.  But my heart compelled me to be here because of the sense of duty I feel to honor her memory, and to remind us all not to squander the sacrifices our elders made to give us a better future.   You see, my mom, in her steady, quiet way, lived out that striving sense of hope every day of her life.   She believed that all children — all people — have value, and that anyone can succeed if given the opportunity.   She and my father didn’t aspire to be wealthy. In fact, they were suspicious of those who took more than they needed.   They understood that it wasn’t enough for their kids to thrive if everyone else around us was drowning.  So my mother volunteered at the local school. She always looked out for the other kids on our block.   She was glad to do the thankless, unglamorous work that for generations, has strengthened the fabric of this nation.   The belief that if you do unto others, that if you love thy neighbor, if you work and scrape and sacrifice, it will pay off — if not for you, then maybe for your children or your grandchildren, those values have been passed on through family farms and factory towns, through tree-lined suburbs and crowded tenements, through prayer groups and National Guard units and social studies classrooms.   Those were the values my mother poured into me until her very last breath.   Kamala Harris and I built our lives on those same foundational values.  Even though our mothers grew up an ocean apart, they shared the same belief in the promise of this country.  That’s why her mother moved here from India at 19.  It’s why she taught Kamala about justice, about our obligation to lift others up and about our responsibility to give more than we take.  She’d often tell her daughter, “Don’t sit around and complain about things — do something!” So with that voice in her head, Kamala went out and worked hard in school, graduating from an HBCU, earning her law degree at a state school and then she went on to work for the people.  Fighting to hold lawbreakers accountable and strengthen the rule of law, fighting to get folks better wages, cheaper prescription drugss, a good education, decent health care, childcare, and elder care.  From a middle-class household, she worked her way up to become vice president of the United States of America.   Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment.  She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency. And she is one of the most dignified — a tribute to her mother, to my mother, and probably to your mother too, the embodiment of the stories we tell ourselves about this country.  Her story is your story. It’s my story. It’s the story of the vast majority of Americans trying to build a better life.  Kamala knows, like we do, that regardless of where you come from, what you look like, who you love, how you worship, or what’s in your bank account, we all deserve the opportunity to build a decent life. All of our contributions deserve to be accepted and valued.  Because no one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American. No one! Kamala has shown her allegiance to this nation, not by spewing anger and bitterness, but by living a life of service and always pushing the doors of opportunity open for others.   She understands that most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth.   If we bankrupt a business, or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third, or fourth chance.   If things don’t go our way, we don’t have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead, we don’t get to change the rules so we always win.  If we see a mountain in front of us, we don’t expect there to be an escalator waiting to take us to the top.  No, we put our heads down. We get to work. In America, we do something.  And throughout her entire life, that’s exactly what we’ve seen from Kamala Harris: the steel of her spine, the steadiness of her upbringing, the honesty of her example and yes, the joy of her laughter and her light.  It couldn’t be more obvious. Of the two major candidates in this race, only Kamala Harris truly understands the unseen labor and unwavering commitment that has always made America great.  Unfortunately, we know what comes next. we know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth.   My husband and I, sadly, know a little something about this.  For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.   His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black.  Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those “Black jobs”?   It’s his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.  You see, gutting our health care, taking away our freedom to control our bodies, the freedom to become a mother through IVF, like I did— those things are not going to improve the health outcomes of our wives, mothers, and daughters.   Shutting down the Department of Education, banning our books —none of that will prepare our kids for the future.  Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love — that doesn’t make anybody’s life better.   Instead, it only makes us small.   And let me tell you, going small is never the answer.  Going small is the opposite of what we teach our children.  Going small is petty. It’s unhealthy. And quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.  Why would we accept this from anyone seeking our highest office?   Why would we normalize this type of backward leadership?  Doing so only demeans and cheapens our politics. It only serves to further discourage good, big-hearted people from wanting to get involved at all.   America, our parents taught us better than that, and we deserve so much better than that.  That’s why we must do everything in our power to elect two of those good, big-hearted people. There is no other choice than Kamala Harris and Tim Walz!  But as we embrace this renewed sense of hope, let us not forget the despair we have felt. Let us not forget what we are up against.  Yes, Kamala and Tim are doing great right now. They’re packing arenas across the country and folks are energized. We’re feeling good.  But there are still so many people who are desperate for a different outcome, who are ready to question and criticize every move Kamala makes, who are eager to spread those lies, who don’t want to vote for a woman, who will continue to prioritize building their wealth over ensuring everyone has enough.  No matter how good we feel tonight or tomorrow or the next day, this is still going to be an uphill battle. So we cannot be our own worst enemies.  No, the minute something goes wrong, the minute a lie takes hold, we cannot start wringing our hands.   We cannot get a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right.   We cannot indulge our anxieties about whether this country will elect someone like Kamala instead of doing everything we can to get someone like Kamala elected.  Kamala and Tim have lived amazing lives. I am confident they will lead with compassion, inclusion, and grace.  But they are still only human. They are not perfect. And like all of us, they will make mistakes.  But luckily, this is not just on them.   No, this is up to us — all of us — to be the solution we seek. It is up to all of us to be the antidote to all the darkness and division.  I don’t care how you identify politically; whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, independent, or none of the above. This is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right.  To stand up not just for our basic freedoms but for decency and humanity — for basic respect, dignity, and empathy — for the values at the very foundation of this democracy.  It’s up to us to remember what Kamala’s mother told her: Don’t just sit around and complain — do something!  So if they lie about her, and they will, we’ve got to do something!  If we see a bad poll, and we will, we’ve got to put down that phone and do something!  If we start feeling tired, if we start feeling that dread creeping back in, we’ve got to pick ourselves up, throw water on our faces, and do something!    We have only two and a half months to get this done; only 11 weeks to make sure every single person we know is registered and has a voting plan.  So we cannot afford for anyone to sit on their hands and wait to be called upon. Don’t complain if no one from the campaign has specifically reached out to ask for your support. There is simply no time for that kind of foolishness.  You know what we need to do.  So consider this to be your official ask: Michelle Obama is asking you to do something! Because this is going to be close.  In some states, just a handful of votes in every precinct could decide the winner.   So we need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt. We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us.   Our fate is in our hands.  In 77 days, we have the power to turn our country away from the fear, division, and smallness of the past.  We have the power to marry our hope with our action.   We have the power to pay forward the love, sweat, and sacrifice of our mothers and fathers and all those who came before us.  We did it before and we sure can do it again.  Let us work like our lives depend on it.  Let us keep moving our country forward and go higher — yes, higher — than we’ve ever gone before. As we elect the next president and vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz!"
Ella Emhoff is the stepdaughter that stepmoms like me have been waiting for,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:51 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 20, 2024, 8:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doug-emhoff-kids-ella-cole-kamala-harris-mom-rcna167470,"When I became a stepmom in 2017 to a precocious 6-year-old, I had no idea where to look for role models. I searched high and low, but I was disheartened by what I found. Stepmothers still struggle to outrun the negative stigma of being “the other,” a perception reinforced by fairy tales and, more recently, Republican politicians. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, for one, has publicly delegitimized stepmoms, as has Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Vance has called Vice President Kamala Harris “anti-child” and a “childless cat lady.” But that’s news to her stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, the daughter of Harris’ husband, Doug. (Doug was married to film producer Kerstin Emhoff before the couple divorced in 2008.) Together with her brother, Cole, the 25-year-old recently defended Harris on social media, posting, “I love my three parents.” Imagine the stepchildren and stepparents today who can point to a photo of Kamala and Ella embracing each other (a photo I sent to my stepdaughter) and use it as a touchstone, a guiding force and a powerful example of a nonnuclear family. Imagine watching this blended family on stage at the DNC this week, as Americans fight to elect a presidential candidate who is not only a woman of color, but also a stepmom. I wish I could have had that example a few years ago. Instead, I struggled for guidance. It could feel like the blind leading the blind as I began reading Reddit forums about stepparenting and following niche stepmom influencers. I purchased memoirs written by stepmoms, and the book “The Birth of a Foster, Adoptive or Stepmother: Beyond Biological Mothering Attachments.” I read a few essays online — and wrote a few more. I felt an urgent need to publicly defend stepmothering and fill the cultural gaps I was still experiencing in real time.  Because for years Disney movies (and non-Disney movies) have told us that biological mothers and stepmothers are inherently enemies. We are pitted against one another, with stepmoms assumed to be the evil interlopers. And even if we weren’t “evil” per se, we definitely weren’t “real” parents. As my stepdaughter grew into a teenager, this was a topic we spoke about frequently, wondering aloud why stepmoms were treated so poorly. We made sure to nurture our relationship by celebrating Stepmom’s Day every year.  We all know kids need to see themselves represented in the world around them, especially as they come of age. Ella Emhoff is the perfect example of what it means to challenge nuclear family stereotypes. The so-called First Daughter of Bushwick has armpit hair, crochets, supports trans rights and gender-affirming care and clearly has no patience for anyone trying to denigrate her familial relationships. This isn’t “Cinderella.” It’s much, much better. It is also obvious that both Ella and her brother respect and admire their stepmom. They don't resent his second wife; they are happy that their dad is happy. And this respect is mirrored by Doug’s first wife, Kerstin. Indeed, when Vance’s attacks on Harris started to get picked up by the press, Kerstin, too, came to the aid of her parenting partner. “For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” she said in a statement. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.” And while Republicans may not want to admit it, blended families like these are not only normal — they are common. ""It’s a cool dynamic we all have,"" Ella told The New York Times in 2021. ""And I think it is a good model to show that you can have this and this isn’t weird. Like it’s not weird to be friends or have a good relationship with your ex. It’s actually very healthy."" In his 2020 Atlantic article “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake,” David Brooks writes that today, nuclear families with two-biological-parent households are in the minority. But, he adds, that’s not cause for panic. “The good news is that human beings adapt, even if politics are slow to do so. When one family form stops working, people cast about for something new—sometimes finding it in something very old,” he noted. And one of those “old” ideas is the concept of kinship. ""We think of kin as those biologically related to us,"" Brooks writes. ""But throughout most of human history, kinship was something you could create.”  My closest circle of friends are all in unique and thriving family structures: My best friends are a family of three: an adoptive dad and stepdad and their 13-year-old daughter. They co-parent with the other adoptive dad from the previous marriage. Another friend lives in a polyamorous polycule with their partner of 10 years, their partner’s partner and their partner’s partner’s two kids. They argue this structure only makes their family stronger. One of my close friends in her 40s lives unmarried with her boyfriend and his 6-year-old son, who goes back and forth between homes.  Are these families not “real”? If you live with the child, are you a “real” parent? What about if you drive your stepchild to school for years? What if they sleep next to you when they have nightmares? How can you pass an impossible test?  Stepmom alienation and discrimination is a specific kind of disenfranchised grief. Indeed, it takes a strong person to be a stepparent — this journey is not for the faint of the heart. I’ve even been called a “childless stepmom” over the years; truly the most absurd oxymoron you could come up with.  Believe me: When you hold your stepdaughter’s hair while she throws up, drive her to and from school, fly with her to Europe for the first time, take her to urgent care, argue with her about cleaning her room, help pay for her private school, leave Post-its all over the apartment that say, “Brush your teeth,” help her pick out a dress for her first dance, teach her how to wash her face — and wear deodorant and hula hoop and pump gas — you aren’t “childless,” you’re child-plus.  This is something the first daughter of Bushwick, and potentially the first female president of the United States, both understand. Kamala Harris isn’t some lesser, “other” mom. She’s just Momala. "
Biden’s greatest gift to Kamala Harris is a united Democratic Party,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:52 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-biden-harris-speakers-sanders-aoc-clinton-rcna167360,"The first night of the Democratic National Convention concluded with President Joe Biden’s valedictory speech passing the proverbial torch to his vice president, Kamala Harris. But the proceedings before Biden’s address, which closed with the two hugging on stage, made clear Biden has done more than hand off a presidential nomination. He’s also bequeathed her a party that, thanks in part to his efforts, is perhaps more united than any time in history. Eight years ago, at the 2016 Democratic convention, the divide between partisans for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was impossible to ignore. Sanders’ supporters remained bitter about his defeat in the 2016 primaries, with many falsely accusing the DNC of rigging the election against him — and staging large protests in the streets of Philadelphia. Hundreds of his supporters walked out of the convention hall when Clinton officially clinched the nomination, while those who stayed held up signs criticizing Clinton and maintaining their support for Sanders. Given the narrowness of that November’s election, the left-wing insurgency against Clinton arguably contributed to her defeat. None of these divisions will be evident this week. On Tuesday night, Sanders will deliver a prime-time address, following last night’s similarly plum speaking spot for the woman who seconded his nomination at the 2020 convention: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Indeed, Ocasio-Cortez might have bumped into Clinton backstage on Monday night, as the two spoke just minutes apart. Even more importantly, both women offered similar messages supporting Biden’s accomplishments and Kamala Harris’s promise. The Democratic Party still has some divisions, particularly over the war in Gaza, but even on that issue, there is far more unanimity among elected Democrats than it might seem. On Monday night, when Ocasio-Cortez called for a cease-fire in Gaza and a return of Israeli hostages, she was endorsing the White House’s position on the issue. This new spirit of party unity is driven, in part, by vast and often underappreciated shifts within the two parties. In the run-up to this week’s convention in Chicago, much was written about comparing this event to the party’s Windy City convention in 1968. But for all the similarities, many of those present in Chicago 56 years ago would likely not recognize the Democratic Party of today.  In 1968, there were significant and unbridgeable differences among Democrats over the war in Vietnam, civil rights, law and order and even the proper role of government in the lives of the American people.  In fact, for a good chunk of the Democratic Party’s modern history, there were two distinct political wings — a Southern wing of unreconstructed segregationists and a Northern wing of more liberal Democrats and Black Americans.  But over the past two decades, the South has become increasingly dominated by the GOP, while Democrats have conquered the North and the West Coast. Moderate Democrats — and moderate Republicans — have gone the way of the dodo bird. Polarization has led to less split-ticket voting and greatly decreased the incentives for members of either party to avoid party dogma. The two parties have gone from being unwieldy heterogeneous groupings to largely homogenous political constellations.  But despite greater ideological agreement, the divisions in 2016 were real and serious. Biden has gone out of his way to smooth them over. When he won the Democratic nomination in 2020, with Sanders again the runner-up, Biden did the opposite of what most presumptive nominees have traditionally done — rather than run to the political center, he extended an olive branch to the left. He adopted key elements of the left’s policy agenda on everything from crime and the environment to education, health care and trade.  Biden’s actions as the nominee befitted a politician who navigated between the center and left in his decades in the Senate and seemingly always ended up smack dab in the middle of the two sides. As president, Biden continued this balancing act — maintaining lines of communication with the left and supporting parts of their policy agenda, most notably on the issue of student loan forgiveness. While other Democratic presidents (see Bill Clinton and Barack Obama) have had adversarial relationships with the left, Biden has been the exact opposite. It was small wonder that in July, when many Democrats were clamoring for Biden to step down as party nominee, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders and their allies were among the biggest proponents of Biden staying on the ticket. To be sure, the specter of another Trump term in office is perhaps the strongest unifying force for Democrats. Still, when it comes to hot-button issues that once divided the party — abortion, guns, immigration, trade, unions, civil rights, even criticisms of corporate America — there is little evident daylight among Democrats. That has helped create a striking sense of unity this week that goes well beyond antipathy toward the GOP nominee.  While Republicans are seemingly united by their support of Donald Trump, the seamless shift from Biden to Harris shows that Democrats, in 2024, are largely signing from the same policy hymnal. Even more than his full-throated endorsement of Harris, this might be Biden’s biggest gift to her — and to the Democratic Party."
Why Joe Biden's DNC speech was unlike anything we've seen before,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/joe-biden-donald-trump-dnc-speech-contrast-rcna167406,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC's Aug. 19 special coverage of the Democratic National Convention. President Joe Biden’s appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night was, in many ways, foreign content for those who have followed American politics. Let’s be clear, Biden is a man with a formidable ego. He’s the president of the United States. He was a U.S. senator for more than three decades. He’s spent 50 years in public life. This is someone who occupies a room and someone who likes attention. But that’s also paired with Biden’s deep sense of service. That is what fundamentally contrasts him with Donald Trump, a person who has lived his entire life in service of ego and avoiding ego death. Trump is willing to do anything to preserve his ego, even if it means bringing down the constitutional republic rather than admitting he lost an election. In Biden, you have someone whose last major political act was to get on stage and tell the American people to vote for someone else – to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It's something we’ve never seen before. It’s incredible to watch in real time, to witness someone acting in service of something higher than themselves, in service of the Democratic Party, in service of the country and in service of American democracy.

That includes both individuals already out of a job and ones currently employed but seeking new roles.” * Good move: “Disney has backpedaled on its stance in a wrongful death suit filed by a widower whose wife died after eating at a restaurant in Disney World, now saying it’ll waive arbitration that it argued the man agreed to when signing up for Disney+.” See you tomorrow."
Could Taylor Swift sue Trump over his social media post?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/taylor-swift-sue-trump-truth-social-post-ai-rcna167380,"Could Taylor Swift sue Donald Trump? The question arises after the GOP presidential nominee shared several images (some generated by artificial intelligence) on his social media platform suggesting that the singer and her fans support his campaign. One of the images portrayed Swift’s likeness in Uncle Sam-style fashion, accompanied by the text: “Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.” The former president added: “I accept!” Swift could sue. And while there are any number of reasons that the pop star won’t expend the effort of taking Trump to court, one legal area that could be relevant is the right of publicity, which protects people from certain forms of unauthorized exploitation. That subject arose in another high-profile context recently, when OpenAI developed a chatbot voice assistant that sounded much like Scarlett Johansson; the company subsequently pulled it after public scrutiny, but denied that it was an imitation of the actor’s voice. (Representatives for Trump’s campaign and Swift didn’t immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.) Trump’s post comes as many legal questions remain unanswered in this era of AI proliferation and the internet. There isn’t presently reason to think that this episode will become a legal case that tests those frontiers — saying nothing of whatever would come of such a case, including any defenses (including on First Amendment grounds) that Trump would seek to raise. But if he continues to potentially antagonize the star, whose political sympathies seem to lie elsewhere, we may find out how much of a case she has.

Bob Menendez acquittal motion previews appeal issues in bribery case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/bob-menendez-motion-bribery-corruption-judge-rcna167425,"Bob Menendez is set to resign his Senate seat on Tuesday, following his federal corruption convictions last month. But while his political chapter as a long-serving New Jersey Democrat is closing, his legal battle may be just beginning. It will take many months, if not years, for that legal fight to conclude. But a new motion from his defense lawyers may signal the issues that he’ll press on appeal, likely all the way to the Supreme Court. A New York federal jury found him guilty on all counts including bribery, acting as a foreign agent and obstructing justice.  That motion for a post-trial acquittal or new trial, filed in the trial court Monday, is a long shot to succeed. But in the likely event that the motion is denied and his case proceeds to sentencing on Oct. 29, it may foreshadow issues that he’ll raise to higher courts.  Contending that all of his convictions must be reversed, Menendez’s lawyers wrote to U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in the Southern District of New York that “if sustained on such a surprisingly thin reed of evidence, these convictions will make terrible, dangerous law.” The defense lawyers argued that, despite alleging that Menendez had agreed to sell official acts for bribes, prosecutors at trial “offered no actual evidence of an agreement, just speculation masked as inference.”  Among the defense’s specific claims are that the government failed to prove a quid pro quo and that Menendez’s “speech or debate” protections for members of Congress were violated. They also argue that the evidence was otherwise insufficient and that New York was an improper venue, with the bulk of the conduct occurring in New Jersey or Washington, D.C.  A Supreme Court case frequently cited in the motion is McDonnell v. United States, where the high court in 2016 narrowed corruption-related prosecutions in siding with former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. The justices have continued to side with defendants in such cases in the years since, including just this past term in Snyder v. United States, which curbed the use of federal bribery law against state and local officials, with the court holding that the law doesn’t make it a crime for officials to accept gratuities for past acts. Menendez’s lawyers briefly cite the Snyder case as well, in arguing that “because the government prosecuted Menendez on a theory of bribes, not gratuities, the evidence of after-the-fact payments cannot be used to sustain a bribery conviction absent some evidence that Senator Menendez was expecting these after-the-fact payments. No such evidence was offered.” The appellate issues may further crystallize as the case moves forward, with the next highest court being the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as his lawyers work to make Menendez’s case one of the next in that line of favorable Supreme Court precedents for political corruption defendants.

The Harris-Walz campaign announced the launch of a WhatsApp channel, expanding its social media outreach to the messaging app that’s immensely popular in some Latino communities. The move can also be seen partly as an effort to combat the spread of right-wing misinformation on the platform: A Nielsen report in 2021 found Latinos were more likely than other groups to receive, consume and share misinformation, and it cited WhatsApp as a hub where much of that misinformation was exchanged.

Singer Chappell Roan's TikTok exposes the distressing impact of stan-dom,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 1:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chappell-roan-tiktok-fans-stalking-harassment-rcna167382,"Singer Chappell Roan has spoken openly about feeling overwhelmed by the fame that followed her stratospheric rise to pop stardom over the past year. And on Monday, she elaborated on those feelings, expressing frustration with entitled fans and saying people have been harassing her and stalking her family. ""If you saw a random woman on the street, would you yell at her from the car window? Would you harass her in public?"" she asked in a video on TikTok. ""Would you go up to a random lady and say, 'Can I get a photo with you?' And she's like, 'No, what the f---,' and then you get mad at this random lady? Would you be offended if she says no to your time because she has her own time?"" Roan said in a subsequent video that she didn't care if such behavior from fans was par for the course for public figures: The 26-year-old pop star, who has been making music since her teenage years, became a massive commercial phenomenon in the past year after she opened for Olivia Rodrigo’s world tour and released her single “Good Luck, Babe!” in April. Roan has talked about her disdain for fans who feel entitled to her time and affection in the past. Her rejection of being on the receiving end of parasocial relationships — that is, a one-sided emotional bond someone creates with a person they don't actually know — is not uncommon among celebrities, though Roan is more outspoken about it than most. The downsides to ""stan culture"" are also well-documented; artists have alluded to the lack of privacy and demand for access into every aspect of their lives, and some celebrities have been accused of sanctioning their fans' bad behavior toward other public figures.  In a podcast interview last month, Roan said that fans have been tracking her movements and unearthing details about her family. She said she previously told herself she would consider quitting music if fans' behavior crossed the line. ""We're there,"" she said, adding: ""I've like pumped the brakes on honestly anything to make me more known."""
AOC once electrified the left. Now she electrifies the party establishment.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 1:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aoc-speech-dnc-gaza-left-rcna167346,"At the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., got 90 seconds to speak. Ocasio-Cortez was then a freshman lawmaker who’d toppled a 10-term Democratic incumbent with a left-wing campaign that shocked the party and the country. Her speech, delivered on the second night of that convention, was about rallying progressives and seconding the presidential nomination of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. It was a symbolic move because he had lost his presidential campaign, his second one, in the primaries. She spoke about her loyalty to a “mass people’s movement,” which she said was needed to address the “brutality” of the economy, recognize “colonialism” and propose “deep systemic solutions.” She was speaking at a convention for the party, but her remarks were aimed at the party’s shortcomings. Ocasio-Cortez’s speech Monday night couldn’t have been more different.  She was given seven minutes during a prime-time slot on opening night. She introduced herself as a former waitress but made no mention of her background as a left-wing political organizer. She wasn’t sounding a dissenting note about a failed insurgency; instead, she was firing up the crowd for the nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Gone was the talk about a mass movement; Ocasio-Cortez focused on the health and the future of the Democratic Party, including winning not just the White House, but majorities in both chambers of Congress. While Ocasio-Cortez spoke about class divisions, the rhetoric was dialed down, more in line with the party establishment’s generic conception of the wealthy versus the rest. Ocasio-Cortez's praise for Harris for being “for the middle class because she is from the middle class” made her sound more like a centrist Democrat than a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Monday night's Ocasio-Cortez had grown into a creature of the establishment, both for better and for worse. The contrast between her two DNC appearances illustrates Ocasio-Cortez’s swift ascendance within the party. Ocasio-Cortez remains the leading voice of “the Squad,” the most progressive bloc of lawmakers in the House. But her collaboration with President Joe Biden during his time in office — during which he governed further to the left on social spending and climate policy than anyone expected — has resulted in her evolution from gadfly to strategic progressive partner for the party. She serves as an advocate and surrogate for certain sectors of the left within the party, but simultaneously maintains increasingly strong ties with the upper echelons of the party. She did not play hardball with Biden with defections from his bills as he compromised on progressive legislation to win over conservatives in the party. And in the most striking display of her change to date, Ocasio-Cortez, alongside Sanders, argued for Biden to remain the party’s presidential nominee even as the party establishment turned on him after his fateful June debate performance against former President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez’s rationale for that may have been based primarily on the strategic belief that Biden was more reliable than any potential establishment successor as a friend of the left. But still, her sticking vociferously by his side despite his extreme unpopularity reflected a strategic calculus removed from her background of channeling grassroots energy. Becoming an operator means more input into consequential policy. But it often also means becoming a more pliant politician. The most striking — and disappointing — moment of Ocasio-Cortez’s speech came when she praised Harris for “working tirelessly to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.” It was a stunning dodge on the biggest issue for the American movement left today. The Biden administration has long stated that it desires a cease-fire; the real problem is the administration’s failure to take any punitive steps against Israel, which has shown stunning disregard for civilian life in Gaza while contemplating radical solutions at odds with international law and dragging its feet. Ocasio-Cortez could’ve called for the party to focus on the plight of Palestinian civilians there, or reverse its wicked policy of defunding the UNRWA that makes it harder to get life-saving supplies distributed throughout the territory. She could’ve issued a subtle challenge to Harris to take a position on conditioning aid to Israel. She could’ve supported some of the protesters raging outside the convention as calling for overdue moral clarity. Instead, she used her influence as the most prominent progressive in Congress to give Harris a green light without Harris having really done anything to earn it. And, thus, Ocasio-Cortez summed up the vexing eternal trade-offs of gaining power: The closer one gets to the center of power, the less capable one is of fundamentally challenging it."
Why the DNC already has Republicans scared,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 12:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-dnc-republicans-patriotism-trump-harris-rcna167393,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 20 episode of ""Morning Joe."" You look at the first night of the Democratic National Convention and you just can’t calculate that. You can’t fake that level of joy. People are either enjoying themselves and are happy or they’re not.  As for the Republican ticket, you have two candidates — who at least publicly — project misery. They’re not happy. They’re always looking for retribution. They’re looking for people to blame. They’re looking for a reason to be upset. They’re looking for a reason to resent.  It couldn’t be more different for the Democrats. I swear, I never thought I would see this in my lifetime. As a Republican, I thought it was just too easy to beat Democrats because they’re afraid to have a good time. They’re afraid to be joyful. But what Republicans watching at home feared the most Monday night was not just the joy radiating from the crowd, but also their chants of “USA, USA, USA.” Why did that message ring true at the DNC? Because the Republican Party has sold itself to a man who lies about America. A man who says we’re a nation in decline, a nation of losers, that we’re on the verge of collapse. That is not true. The data doesn’t bear it out, economically, militarily, culturally, socially — in every way.  This is a great country. That’s why the Democratic Party is cheering and those cheers give them a hell of a contrast with the presidential candidate on the Republican side who talks down about America every day on the stump."
The most powerful moment of the DNC so far was also the most sickening,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 12:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-speaker-hadley-duvall-abortion-amanda-zurawski-rcna167413,"From a rousing, passing-of-the-torch speech from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to a career-defining address from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it was women — both the child-free and the moms — who mostly defined Day 1 of the Democratic National Convention.  President Joe Biden’s keynote notwithstanding, it wasn’t a seasoned politician, former party leader or Hollywood A-lister who delivered the most moving moment of the evening. Because an hour before the president delivered his address, three ordinary women stole the show with their brave and — incredibly awful — stories of life in a post-Roe world. Amanda Zurawski, Kaitlyn Joshua and Hadley Duvall — three abortion storytellers who shared some of the most harrowing, painful moments of their lives in front of millions — crystalized a sickening reality. Women (and some men) are still being asked to tear themselves open again and again in order to prove we are all worthy of respect, autonomy and basic human rights. Women (and some men) are picking open scabs on live television, reopening intensely personal wounds for public consumption and discussion. I don’t disagree with their inclusion last night. It was smart, and necessary, for the Democratic Party to not only center abortion, but also center abortion stories. The party has been playing a losing game of defense, with many leaders seemingly too scared to even say the word “abortion” out loud. Last night, the people most impacted by abortion bans and anti-abortion restrictions were finally front and center.  This shift is no doubt the result of decades of work from grassroots organizers and abortion advocates, such as Renee Bracey-Sherman and the team at We Testify, an organization dedicated to the leadership and representation of abortion-seekers, as well as Amelia Bonow, co-founder of Shout Your Abortion, a nonprofit dedicated to normalizing abortion. Studies have shown that personal stories are far more memorable, more powerful and more convincing than statistics, and Democrats are finally acting accordingly.  But these stories shouldn’t be necessary. We should not need to hear from a woman like Zurawski — who detailed just how excited she was to become a mom to Willow, only to go into early labor at 18 weeks and nearly die after she was denied a lifesaving abortion.  We should not be forced to relive the journey as Joshua was turned away from not one, but two Louisiana hospitals —  despite her severe pain from a miscarriage — in order to better understand that comprehensive prenatal care must include abortion care, and that states that ban or severely restrict abortion access have higher rates of maternal and infant mortality. And it’s only getting worse. Duvall, who was raped by her stepfather after enduring years of sexual abuse, should not have to recount the moment her pregnancy test flashed positive at age 12 for all of us to unequivocally call anti-abortion laws exactly what they are: inhumane.  “What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?” Duvall asked the crowd, sucking the air out of Chicago’s boisterous United Center. What is so great about a country that has made such a question necessary?  Women revealing their forever-healing scars in a desperate plea to be believed, to be valued, to be treated as equal human beings. This is not a bug, but a feature of this country.  From Black women recalling their near-death experiences in order to highlight Black maternal mortality inequality and demand equitable prenatal care, to Indigenous women sharing their devastating experiences of sexual abuse to underscore the fact that an estimated 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in their lifetimes, to a woman detailing one terrifying moment in a department store changing room to prove a former president should never be allowed near the White House again, the path to progress has been paved by women’s pain — and their willingness to tell us about it. So while I am forever grateful for Zurawski, Joshua, Duvall and every single abortion storyteller who has bravely made their personal story public, I look forward to the day when I never have to hear another story like theirs told in a basketball stadium again.

"Gaza, Israel loom large over the DNC, even if the speakers hardly talked about it",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 11:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/gaza-dnc-protests-speeches-sidestep-israel-war-rcna167336,"Amid the show of unity on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, it was impossible to ignore the deep divisions within the party on Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza. As Democrats cheered their old guard passing the torch, those in the crowd who spoke up against the United States’ role in the war were promptly silenced, and the speakers onstage largely sidestepped the issue altogether. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York progressive who has criticized Israel’s conduct in the war and the Biden administration’s weapons shipments to Israel, only mentioned Gaza while praising Vice President Kamala Harris for “working tirelessly to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.” Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia said he wished for “the poor children of Israel and the poor children of Gaza ... to be OK” as part of a broad appeal for unity. The most direct reference came from President Joe Biden, who spoke about his efforts to broker a cease-fire deal and get humanitarian aid into Gaza. “Those protesters out in the street, they have a point,” he said, echoing his past acknowledgment of the suffering in Gaza. “A lot of innocent people are being killed — on both sides.” As Biden spoke, a few people in the arena unfurled a banner that read “Stop Arming Israel” amid the “We ❤️ Joe” signs, and a man nearby quickly tried to snatch it away. A reporter inside the venue said the section’s lighting was turned off and the protesters escorted out. Earlier in the day, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched to the United Center, where the convention is being held. A small group of demonstrators broke through a security fence, clashing with police. The “uncommitted” movement, successful enough to send a number of delegates to the DNC this week, has made clear its intent to pressure Harris, who has expressed sympathy for Palestinians while affirming the U.S.’ military and political support for Israel. Pro-Palestinian activists are hoping that Harris will be more receptive to their demands than Biden. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say, since Israel launched its assault after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that killed about 1,200 people. Democrats did hold a panel on Palestinian human rights ahead of the main programming on Monday night. Attendees listened to a pediatric doctor describe the horrific injuries in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis unfolding there. A longtime Democratic organizer, Hala Hijazi, broke down as she talked about how more than 100 relatives of hers have been killed in the conflict. “My family’s dead, y’all. They’re dead,” she said through tears. “And I feel guilty because for 25 years I’ve been living my American dream while they are struggling.”"
Will Trump keep his promise about releasing his medical records?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 11:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/will-trump-keep-promise-releasing-medical-records-rcna167411,"It’s been more than five weeks since Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, though the former president and his political operation have been less than transparent about the medical care he received and the nature of his injuries. It was against this backdrop that CBS News asked the Republican nominee a good question this week. At that point, the GOP candidate proceeded to talk about his “perfect score” on a cognitive test — a subject he’s long struggled to understand — and his belief that every candidate should take one. Trump did not say, however, why he hasn’t yet released his latest medical records to the public, or how long it will take for him to “very gladly” follow up on his promise. Time will tell whether the Republican keeps his word, and given recent history, there’s reason for great skepticism. Indeed, as regular readers know, he’s long adopted a rather untraditional approach to sharing information about his medical exams. It started before he took office. In late 2015, during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Team Trump released an unintentionally hilarious, four-paragraph letter from the late Dr. Harold Bornstein, asserting that Trump’s “physical strength and stamina are extraordinary” and that his lab tests results were “astonishingly excellent.” The doctor added at the time, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” We learned several months later that Bornstein wrote the letter in five minutes while a limo, dispatched by Trump, waited for the document. In the years that followed, disclosures did not improve. Last fall, Trump released the first updated report on his health in more than three years, but it came by way of a statement issued by one of his golf club customers, and it omitted basic details such as his blood pressure and medications. More recently, the former president and his team also ignored calls for medical details after he was shot in the ear. As of this week, however, the GOP candidate made it sound like he’d be only too pleased to share his medical records with the public. If this actually happens, it’ll be a pleasant change of pace — which is why I’m not holding my breath. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Raphael Warnock gave Democrats a dire warning on Night 1 of the DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 11:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/raphael-warnock-dnc-speech-2024-rcna167389,"There was no shortage of inspiring speeches during the first night of the Democratic National Convention, and Sen. Raphael Warnock's was one of the most rousing. There were many moments in the Georgia Democrat's almost 14-minute speech that stuck out, but his warning about the Republican assault on voting rights resonated with me the most. It was a reminder, to anyone who needed it, that the GOP's election subversion efforts surrounding Jan. 6, 2021, never actually ceased — and that Georgians know this firsthand.  He said: Following Donald Trump’s 2020 loss in Georgia, and his failed pressure campaign seeking to overturn the results, Georgia Republicans have instituted some of the strictest voter suppression measures in the nation. Along with that, as my colleague Lisa Rubin wrote for MaddowBlog on Tuesday, Trump loyalists who make up the majority of the Georgia State Election Board have disturbingly altered the electoral process in ways that will make it easier for right-wing election officials to delay certifying local election results should Trump lose in November. Warnock’s warning sounded similar to things I’ve heard and read from Georgia activists who have cautioned Democrats not to lose sight of the right-wing assault on voting rights and fair elections, even as the palpable vigor surrounding the Harris-Walz campaign and recent polling data have Democrats feeling better about their prospects for winning the state.  Georgia, after all, has become a testing ground for some of the Republican Party’s most illiberal experiments, as they try to grease the skids for Republican victories in November. It’s safe to assume their attacks on democracy will only grow more desperate if polling data continues to show Vice President Kamala Harris with more support than Trump has in the state. And several states have followed in Georgia’s footsteps, passing a host of revanchist voter suppression policies of their own.  So I appreciated the senator’s balanced tone in his speech. He energized listeners with talk about all the things a Harris presidency might be able to achieve, such as expanded health care access, improved child care, reproductive rights and peace for children in Israel and the Gaza Strip. But he reminded them of the obstacles — dubious, right-wing laws — they’ll need to overcome to give Harris a chance. The Harris-Walz campaign seems to understand this, given recent reports that it has been staffing up its legal team to combat any election chicanery Republicans may try. And that's good news. Because, as Warnock alluded, officers indeed quelled a violent insurrection Jan. 6, 2021. But the right-wing assault on democracy hasn’t died down since then. "
What Kamala Harris needs to say about Gaza at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 10:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-gaza-dnc-biden-rcna166752,"When it comes to the suffering in Gaza, Vice President Kamala Harris is not President Joe Biden. The people Biden angered with his words, his policies and his “bear hug” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already get that. In fact, the leaders of Michigan’s “uncommitted” movement, who in February convinced more than 100,000 voters to not support Biden in the state’s presidential primary election, have made that very point. In 2020, nearly an estimated 69% of Arab or Muslim voters supported Biden. As Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the uncommitted movement, said at a recent news conference, “There are early indications that there is an openness to engaging with our movement that feels like a shift from how our requests were being treated previously.” Layla Elabed, another co-founder, counted it a positive sign that Harris’ comments after meeting with Netanyahu in July included mention of the horrific suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Harris pointed to “the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time … We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.” Then, she added powerfully, “And I will not be silent.” But the leaders of this movement, which also includes large numbers in other swing states, note that for Harris to truly inspire people, she needs to do more than change tone. She must articulate a new way forward. And the perfect place to do that is at this week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. On the upside, the movement is already seeing results with the Democratic National Committee, on Day One of the convention, holding the first official panel to discuss Palestinian human rights. Panelists included Elabed, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and former Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich. In advance, the uncommitted movement called the panel “an important step toward recognizing the rightful place of human rights advocates for Palestinian rights within the Democratic Party.” And to Harris’ credit, she broke from Biden on his Gaza policy in early March, long before she became her party’s presidential nominee. At the annual commemoration of “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Alabama, she became the most senior member of the Biden administration to publicly call for a cease-fire in the Gaza war. She spoke then of the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and said, “What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed, women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration.” She poignantly added, “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” While Harris reiterated the Biden administration’s “unwavering” commitment to Israel’s security, at the same time, she criticized Netanyahu for imposing restrictions on humanitarian relief and said there can be “no excuses” for not allowing food, water and other supplies into Gaza. Harris’ remarks were a far cry from Biden’s comments weeks after Hamas’ horrific Oct. 7 terrorist attack and Netanyahu’s brutal response that has killed thousands of civilians and collectively punished the more than 2 million people of Gaza. When he was asked then to respond to reports that nearly 2,700 Palestinian children had been killed by Israeli military action, Biden said coldly, “I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed.” Then he added, “I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war.” Since then, Biden has expressed far more compassion for Palestinian suffering, most notably at the State of the Union address where he spoke of the “heartbreaking” killing of “thousands and thousands” of “innocent women and children” and he has worked for a cease-fire. However, to many, Biden’s pivot comes across as less of an organic shift and more like a response to the political pressure. Not only was the uncommitted movement exerting such pressure, but polling from around that time showed that only 36 percent of Democrats approved of Netanyahu’s military actions in Gaza. Add to that, Biden was being vocally pressed to change course in Gaza by Black leaders who represented a core part of his base. But Harris represents something unique for the 80 percent of Democrats who have long supported a cease-fire in Gaza. She is a person of color. For many in the Arab and Muslim community, she looks like family. Both of her parents, as she notes in her book, “The Truths We Hold,” grew up under British colonial rule: her father in Jamaica and her mother in India. And it was her parents’ activism, especially her mother’s participation in the U.S. civil rights movement, that inspired her to become active in politics. Harris’ family history enables her — in a way that Biden cannot — to viscerally understand the pain of a people, in this case the Palestinians, seeking self-determination and equal rights.  I have heard an openness to voting for Harris from many in the Arab and Muslim community — some of whom had vocally opposed Biden because of his Gaza policy. They applaud her words, but policy matters far more. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn, Michigan, made that point on NPR after praising Harris’ criticism of Netanyahu. “What we want is more than just someone who is tough on rhetoric,” he said. “We want somebody who is tough on policy.” The Democratic convention is the perfect platform for Harris to address this. She needs to use this moment to share a policy-based vision for going forward. She needs to expound upon the comments she made after meeting Netanyahu last month, when she spoke of ensuring that “the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.” Consistent with that, she could condition aid to Israel based on committing to a two-state solution. Harris could also vow to enforce the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which requires that any security assistance or military equipment provided to another country by the United States be used in accordance with internationally recognized human rights. This is the very law that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other Democrats want enforced against Netanyahu’s administration. And the list goes on of possible policy prescriptions Harris could announce to show a commitment beyond words, including a potential arms embargo if Netanyahu refuses to use U.S.-supplied weapons in accordance with international law, or she could promise to no longer protect Netanyahu and his administration before the U.N. Security Council by vetoing resolutions that target his government. She could also vow to impose additional U.S. sanctions on extreme settlers engaged in violence directed at Palestinians in the West Bank — where my relatives live. We all get that former President Donald Trump would be far worse for the Palestinian people and for our communities here in the United States. As president, Trump delivered all the right-wing wishes of Netanyahu, including moving the U.S.embassy to Jerusalem, no longer viewing Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal — despite international law to the contrary — and cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to agencies that provide vitally needed assistance to Palestinian refugees. And during his 2024 campaign, Trump has not only cheered on Netanyahu’s war in Gaza but has used the term “Palestinian” as a slur to describe Biden and even Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Few in the uncommitted camp — if any — will vote for Trump. But inspiring the hundreds of thousands of Arabs and Muslims and our allies in swing states from Michigan to Georgia to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania will take more than good vibes from Harris. It will take a well-articulated policy."
2024 electoral map gets a jolt: How many red states are in play?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-electoral-map-gets-jolt-many-red-states-are-play-rcna167378,"With roughly 76 days remaining before Election Day 2024, plenty of voters are eyeing electoral maps, gaming out which states the candidates and parties will need to prevail. The list of battleground states is familiar: Democrats have long believed that success in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan will be essential to a 2024 victory, while Republicans hope to reclaim Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. But what if the map is expanding in unexpected ways? Around this time a month ago, that’s precisely what Republicans were counting on. The Wall Street Journal highlighted a polling report from Blue Rose Research, a Democratic firm, that found President Joe Biden not only losing every battleground state, but also struggling in New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia, Maine and even New Jersey — states he won with relative ease four years ago. A month later, Biden’s re-election effort has ended; Vice President Kamala Harris has picked up the Democratic torch; and the conversation about traditional blue states turning red has effectively run its course. It’s been replaced by a very different kind of discussion — about traditional red states possibly turning blue. Rolling Stone reported: The article, which hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, quoted one GOP operative who said, in reference to the party’s internal data, “They’re looking worse than they should.” This dovetailed with a New York Times report that noted, “Two private polls conducted in Ohio recently by Republican pollsters — which Mr. Trump carried in 2020 with 53 percent of the vote — showed him receiving less than 50 percent of the vote against Ms. Harris in the state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the data.” As for the Sunshine State, USA Today reported last week, “The red wave that washed over Florida in recent years might not be as large as it once seemed, if a new presidential survey is any indication. Vice President Kamala Harris is within ‘striking distance’ of former President Donald Trump in Florida, according to the pollster behind a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University/WSVN-TV survey of 500 likely voters released Tuesday.” While that poll found the GOP nominee ahead in his adopted home state by five points, a Florida Atlantic University poll released around the same time found Trump’s leads over Harris at just three points. (As is always the case, click the links for information on the surveys’ methodologies and margins of error.) To be sure, Democrats continue to see states like Ohio and Florida as aspirational electoral goals, and when the Harris campaign announced its latest round of investments, neither Florida nor Ohio were among the states where the Democratic ticket will be spending limited resources, at least not yet. But (a) that could change in the coming weeks; and (b) North Carolina was among the states Harris is targeting, despite its recent history of backing GOP candidates. In fact, Democrats appear cautiously optimistic about North Carolina — a state Trump won four years ago by just 1 percentage point — and recent polling has bolstered the party's attitudes. In mid-July, the electoral map was expanding in ways that excited Republicans. In mid-August, there’s still some fluidity to the map, but the GOP’s excitement has turned to anxiety."
Disney drops its 'surreal' claim to keep a wrongful death suit out of court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 2:37 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 20, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/disney-plus-lawsuit-wrongful-death-subscription-rcna166618,"UPDATE (Aug. 20, 12:53 p.m.): Disney is now dropping its bid to keep a wrongful death lawsuit out of court based on the plaintiff having signed up for its streaming service, with the company saying that it strives “to put humanity above all other considerations.” Not many people read all (or any) of the fine print when they sign up for a Disney+ account (or any account, for that matter). Perhaps even fewer people would think that such a routine action would block their subsequent wrongful death lawsuit on their spouse’s behalf from being heard in court. Yet that’s essentially what Walt Disney Parks and Resorts lawyers have argued in their push to force such a case into arbitration. They raised the claim in response to the wrongful death suit in Florida state court from Jeffrey Piccolo, who said that his wife, Kanokporn Tangsuan, died from an allergic reaction after eating at a restaurant at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World. Disney’s lawyers argued that the matter should go to arbitration, citing terms they said Piccolo agreed to in creating a Disney+ account and in using a Disney website to purchase tickets to Epcot. In a lengthy court filing this month, Piccolo's lawyer disagreed with Disney's stance, calling it “preposterous” that Piccolo somehow bound the then-nonexistent estate of his wife “to an arbitration agreement buried within certain terms and conditions.” The implications of the company’s position, he went on, are that: He argued that logic “borders on the surreal.” It’s difficult to disagree, though the law can take on a surrealistic quality when someone is suing a large company. Whether this case remains surreal will become more apparent after a court hearing previously set for Oct. 2.

Ron DeSantis last summer. * Donald Trump promoted fake online content over the weekend, falsely suggesting he’d been endorsed by popstar Taylor Swift. As is usually the case, the former president was apparently trying to deceive the public. * In theory, Republican officials are still eager to flip Arizona’s U.S. Senate seat from “blue” to “red” this year. In practice, as The Arizona Republic reports, GOP conspiracy theorist Kari Lake isn’t getting much in the way of intraparty backing: “Of the eight most competitive Senate races across the country, Lake has drawn the least Republican-supportive money in future television ad reservations, a key data point widely viewed in political circles as a sign of serious competition.” * Speaking of key U.S. Senate races, the latest survey in Montana from American Pulse Research and Polling found Republican Tim Sheehy with a six-point lead over incumbent Democratic Sen.

Brian Kemp, the Georgia Republican has confirmed that he’ll support the former president’s candidacy in the fall anyway, even after Trump targeted Kemp’s wife."
Even some Republicans are skeptical of Comer’s new 2024 crusades,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 8:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/even-republicans-are-skeptical-comers-new-2024-crusades-rcna167353,"By every metric, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer’s impeachment crusade against President Joe Biden was a humiliating failure. The Kentucky Republican set out to uncover evidence of wrongdoing and undermine the Democrats’ 2024 nominee, and the GOP congressman ended up finding nothing and watching the incumbent retire. Even many members of Comer’s own party concluded that his efforts were a fiasco. It’s against this backdrop that the hapless chairman apparently has a new plan: Comer’s crusade against the original Democratic ticket was a flop, so he’s trying again with the new Democratic ticket. Politico reported last week, for example, that the Oversight Committee chair is launching an election-season investigation into Vice President Kamala Harris’ work regarding the southern border. As last week neared its end, Comer announced his panel would also investigate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s ties with China. The obvious problem with the Republican congressman’s antics is that he apparently believes the House Oversight Committee is little more than a partisan super PAC. The less obvious problem is that even some of Comer’s intraparty allies — the ones who were frustrated by his failed anti-Biden scheme — think he’s still off-track. Axios reported: The same GOP member went on to tell Axios, “We have an election to win. Don’t make these people [Harris and Walz] martyrs.” Democrats are even less pleased. The same report quoted Rep. Dan Goldman saying, “I don’t think any rational person would see this as anything other than continuing to use official congressional authority, improperly, to help Donald Trump’s electoral goals.” The New York Democrat added that Walz and Harris haven’t “done anything that merits an investigation other than [being] on the Democratic ticket.” In all likelihood, Comer will ignore the latest round of criticisms. Indeed, his anti-Biden gambit was seen by both parties as a debacle quite a while ago, and he nevertheless kept it going for a year and a half, indifferent to the toll it was taking on his credibility and reputation. With this recent history in mind, the Kentuckian will likely shrug his shoulders and keep going after Harris and Walz, despite the abundant evidence that he has engaged in an election-season stunt. That said, if Comer is hoping to see anyone take his latest efforts seriously, the Republican is likely to be disappointed."
The GOP’s offensive against Tim Walz takes a decidedly weird turn,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 7:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-offensive-tim-walz-takes-decidedly-weird-turn-rcna167343,"In March 2021, The New York Times described Sen. Ron Johnson as “the Republican Party’s foremost amplifier of conspiracy theories and disinformation.” It’s been discouraging to see the Wisconsin senator spend the three years that followed proving the criticism true. A month ago, for example, Johnson appeared on Fox News to talk about the assassination attempt that targeted Donald Trump. “I’ve seen some pretty interesting video on the internet by experts that certainly calls into question what the FBI is telling us about a single shooter,” the GOP lawmaker said, apparently indifferent to the fact that those discredited videos were spread by fringe conspiracy theorists. A month later, Johnson again spoke to Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo, and as The Independent noted, the Wisconsin Republican shared some similarly weird thoughts. No, seriously. Johnson — a man Senate Republicans put in charge of the Senate Homeland Security Committee for six years — told a national television audience with a straight face, “It’s very strange. [Walz] got married on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square. He’s gone to China. He’s taught in China. He’s got deep connections to China.” Hours later, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer appeared on Fox News and suggested that it’s “very possible” that China has been “grooming” Walz for decades. Chris Lehmann’s latest piece for The Nation made the case that too many Republicans “have a bad case of Walz Derangement Syndrome,” and lawmakers like Johnson and Comer are helping prove the point. I am, of course, mindful of the broader circumstances. After Vice President Kamala Harris tapped the Minnesota governor for the Democrats’ 2024 ticket, the race was on in GOP circles to define a man who was largely unknown to a national audience. But Republican efforts have become so utterly ridiculous that they’re literally unbelievable. The smear of Walz’ military service was ugly and wrong; the Somali flag story was idiotic; the tampons story was worse; and practically every other line of attack the GOP has come up with has proved to be false or exaggerated. And that apparently led Johnson and Comer to start pushing weird rhetoric about the governor and China. The question for voters is straightforward: If the Democratic vice presidential nominee is so awful, why are his Republican critics stuck peddling nonsense?"
The Georgia election board is rewriting election law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/georgia-election-board-grubbs-rule-rcna167241,"While much of the news media is focused this week on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, I've got Georgia on my mind. Why? Because the Georgia State Election Board, during its meeting Monday, considered even more rules and amendments to existing rules governing the state's elections. Over the last two weeks, as I and others have documented, the board — composed of a Republican chair, three Donald Trump loyalists praised by the former president as “pit bulls,” and a lone Democrat — pushed ahead with two new concerning actions. First, it approved a new rule that allows county election boards to delay certifying their results while conducting “reasonable inquiries."" Then, it voted to direct Georgia's attorney general to investigate an already-settled complaint about Fulton County's 2020 ballot tabulation errors. (The state's AG, Chris Carr, advised the board before its vote that reopening a complaint would be unlawful and released a formal written opinion Monday stating the board has no right to direct him to conduct any such investigation.) Both steps taken by the election board have been roundly criticized as wolves in sheep's clothing, election administration edition: They are seemingly neutral processes, implemented in Georgia counties. In reality, they're intended to prevent the certification of some counties' or even statewide results. Yet, the Georgia Election Board was hardly content to stop there. At Monday's meeting, it approved an amendment to an existing rule proposed by Cobb County GOP Chair Salleigh Grubbs. As laid out in Grubbs' petition, the amendment requires county boards to conduct a precinct-by-precinct “reconciliation” of votes in which they must “compare the total number of ballots cast to the total number of unique voter ID numbers.” It further requires that if there is any discrepancy between the two, no matter how small or non-outcome-determinative, an investigation must be launched. “No votes shall be counted from that precinct” until the results of that investigation are presented to a county board, the petition states. But that's not all. The so-called Grubbs Rule also empowers county-level election commissioners to “examine all election-related documentation created during the conduct of elections prior to certification of results.” That lesser-known feature of the rule has been flagged to me by voting rights lawyers and activists as not just a way to delay or withhold certification, but more significantly, a potential means to collect ""evidence"" to perpetuate another “big lie” should Vice President Kamala Harris win the presidential election in Georgia.  Throughout the public comments during Monday's meeting, Georgia election workers from counties all over the state, interested residents and civil rights advocates all raised concerns that the Grubbs Rule would prevent counties from reporting results by the time required by state law. Instead, the rule ""would set 159 counties up for failure,"" as one election worker noted. Nevertheless, proponents of the rule suggested that all they are doing is ensuring compliance with existing Georgia code. Former Homeland Security official and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli even tried to distance the reconciliation proposal from the 2020 election interference scheme, suggesting ""the other side was complaining in 2016 ... and it's whoever loses complains."" Sadly for Cuccinelli, however, the ultraconservative ""voter fraud conspiracy"" group True the Vote, which has been focused lately on challenging voter registrations in multiple states, dropped the ruse. In a celebratory tweet, the group praised the Georgia election board for establishing ""a common sense audit trail"" in passing the Grubbs Rule. That there will be a need for an audit in any specific Georgia county, much less all of them, is simply assumed. And so, Georgians barrel toward a November election where their election board has approved a series of arcane, but dangerous, procedures aimed at avoiding county-level certification and fueling tales of fraud and woe. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has been stripped of his role on the board, and short of certifying the state's results without wayward counties, may be unable to do much. It's not clear Carr or Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp can stop the board either (although Kemp has received a complaint from the former Fulton County Election Board chair asking him to remove three board members for their unlawful conduct). Will Georgia's courts ultimately be the state's best hope for timely and fair elections? Watch this space."
Officials confirm: Iranian hackers breached Trump’s 2024 campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/officials-confirm-iranian-hackers-breached-trumps-2024-campaign-rcna167333,"It was 10 days ago when Donald Trump’s campaign said that it had been hacked by an Iranian group in June. As it turns out, the claims were apparently true. NBC News reported: “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” the agencies said in the statement. The fact that the joint statement referenced the “campaigns” was notable in part because Team Trump apparently wasn’t the only target. NBC News’ report added, “The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked.” Iran, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing. To date, news organizations have not published any of the information obtained from Trump’s political operation, which is certainly in line with the Republican campaign’s appeals. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process,” Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement when the allegations first reached the public. Team Trump added, “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” At first blush, that statement seemed largely unremarkable. In fact, what Cheung claimed turned out to be true: Team Trump was breached; documents were obtained illegally; the thieves were apparently foreign adversaries; and their goal was to interfere in an American presidential election. There is, however, a disconnect between the message and the messenger. As Robert Schlesinger explained in a piece for The New Republic: Quite right. In 2016, when it was Russia targeting the U.S. presidential election and exposing materials stolen from Democratic computers, Trump celebrated WikiLeaks, cheered on his benefactors in Moscow and publicly urged Americans to embrace the hack and its ill-gotten gains. At the time, it was Democrats who issued statements such as, “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” And it was Trump who effectively said, “I don’t care.” As far as the Republican is concerned, documents obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to sow chaos throughout our democratic process, must be rejected — unless they benefit his quest for power."
The feud continues: John Kelly rejects Trump’s Medal of Honor line,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/feud-john-kelly-rejects-donald-trump-medal-honor-election-2024-rcna167321,"Donald Trump’s lengthy record of disparaging military service took a turn for the worse last week when the former president said the Presidential Medal of Freedom was “much better” than the Medal of Honor because those who receive the nation’s highest military honor are often wounded or dead. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, among others, condemned the rhetoric as “asinine.” In an interview with an NBC affiliate in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, which aired on Sunday night, the Republican tried to clarify his position, though he effectively just reiterated the comments that sparked the original controversy. Trump’s former White House chief of staff saw his former boss’ comments and apparently felt compelled to condemn what he heard. CNN reported: “Think of Normandy, Iwo Jima, Vietnam or Fallujah,” Kelly told CNN. “The Medal of Honor is earned, not won, by incredibly brave actions on the battlefield under fire typically by very young men who joined when others did not to defend their country. Their oath to the nation is essentially the oath the president and members of Congress take, that federal judges take, that political appointees also take and includes ‘...that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties...’ “To the service member, the oath is sacred and taken with the understanding that one could be seriously wounded, captured or killed in living up to the words. No president, member of Congress, judge or political appointee — and certainly no recipient of the Presidential Medal — will ever be asked to give life or limb to protect the Constitution. The two awards cannot be compared in any way. Not even close.” In terms of accuracy and propriety, there can be no doubt that the retired four-star Marine general has the facts on his side. But stepping back, it’s also worth emphasizing the fact that it’s remarkable to see the former president and his former White House chief of staff repeatedly clashing as the election season progresses. As recently as late June, Trump, unprompted, lashed out at Kelly as “dumb” and a “lost soul.” Months earlier, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” There was no great mystery as to the motivation for the offensive. After all, Kelly is the one who confirmed on the record that Trump really did denigrate American servicemembers as “suckers and losers.” “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly told CNN in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of, among other things, “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues,” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. The fact that the Republican nominee is publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Joe Biden didn’t just pass the torch at the DNC — he paid tribute to the future,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-dnc-speech-kamala-harris-rcna167174,"President Joe Biden wiped away tears as he stepped out onto the Democratic National Convention stage on Monday night. His daughter Ashley had just given him a tremendous introduction, following on the heels of her mother, first lady Jill Biden, who had herself followed a line of speakers who thanked Biden for his leadership and strength. Monday night was all about giving Biden his flowers, with signs reading “We ❤️ Joe” waving in the crowd as he composed himself to deliver his speech. The night’s program ran long, so Biden didn’t take the stage until more than a half-hour after he was scheduled to. But he was also early, as he had originally expected to address the crowd in Chicago on Thursday night as the party’s 2024 nominee. But there was no sign of the reported anger or bitterness that Biden felt over this decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, as his successor in the White House. Instead, the president was in the pocket for this speech, fired up in a way he hadn’t been in months, blowing the doors off his State of the Union address this year. This was Biden in his element, unleashed and ready both to brag a little about his accomplishments and channel righteous anger at the ways former President Donald Trump and his movement have hurt, and will hurt, the country. Recounting why he decided to run in 2020, he once again told the story of seeing the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, the night before 2017’s “Unite the Right” rally. “They didn’t even bother to wear their hoods,"" Biden said. “Hate was on the march in America. Old ghosts, in new garments.” He looked back at the successes of his administration, the legislation that’s been passed, how far we’ve come since the depths of the pandemic when he was first elected. It’s a laundry list of accomplishments that Biden had expected to run on himself. Instead, it will be the foundation of Harris’ campaign, as she calls for continuing — and expanding upon — the work of the last four years. But Democrats made sure to give credit where credit is due, with most speakers taking time to shout out Biden’s wins. “Thank you, Joe” rang out from the crowd again and again, including as he spoke. “Thank you, Kamala, too,” Biden told them in response. It was a reverse call-and-response that played out again later into his address, highlighting how Biden has once more embraced this familiar role: acting as a booster and supporter for the person at the top of the ticket. This wasn’t where Biden expected to be two months ago, but he left no doubts that he is all in for his successor and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “I love this job, but I love my country more,” Biden told the crowd, vowing to “be the best volunteer Harris and Walz’s camp have ever seen.” As he worked his way to a close — having surpassed the length of his acceptance speeches in 2008, 2012 and 2020 — he reached back to the early days of his career. “I’m more optimistic about the future now than I was when I was elected a 29-year-old senator,” he told the crowd. He smiled and promised that he meant it; I’m willing to believe it. As Biden concluded, surrounded by family and joined by Harris and her husband, it left me with a feeling that I’d just watched a page turn in America’s history. This was a moment of passing the torch with grace and care in a way that few leaders would have managed when faced with such a decision. What Biden pulled off on Monday night was in its own way as presidential as any official act he’d taken while, as he put it, a kid with a stutter who grew up to sit behind the Resolute Desk."
Why Judge Merchan shouldn’t delay Trump’s New York sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-sentencing-delay-merchan-alvin-bragg-manhattan-rcna167236,"Former President Donald Trump’s effort to dodge accountability for his crimes is still going strong. It’s not just his unhinged campaign for president, which represents an attempt to avoid prison. He has also continued pushing for delays in all four criminal cases against him, most recently demanding his criminal sentencing in Manhattan be delayed until after the election. Because there is no basis for this latest delay under the law and Trump’s political purposes are so obvious, the court should reject this out of hand. Trump was convicted back in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, all to cover up interfering in the 2016 presidential election by paying hush money to an adult film actress to hide their affair. Having already successfully postponed his sentencing from July 11 to Sept. 18, Trump’s attorneys recently asked Judge Juan Merchan to further postpone it until after Election Day. In response, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office on Monday deferred to the judge’s discretion but noted “there are strong reasons” that Trump’s position should be rejected.  Under New York sentencing law, the test Merchan must apply is whether the delay is “reasonable.” It is anything but. For starters, Trump’s motion for delay cites the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. U.S., which provides at least presumptive immunity for official acts. On Sept. 16, two days before the current sentencing date, Merchan will rule on Trump’s motion to vacate his conviction on the basis of that immunity ruling. Trump’s lawyers claim that he cannot be sentenced until after any appeals of the Sept. 16 decision are fully and finally resolved.  Huh? Whatever may be said about the mix of official and unofficial acts at issue in the 2020 attempted coup, which was the subject of the Supreme Court’s decision, the Manhattan case clearly concerns unofficial conduct. As the DA’s office explained in a separate and meticulously detailed filing last month, a presidential candidate conspiring to interfere in an election by paying hush money to a porn star and then falsifying business records to cover it up simply does not describe the commission of official presidential acts.  Moreover, although Trump complains about the admission at trial of evidence relating to events that happened in the White House (such as a conversation Trump had with an official adviser in 2018), this evidence was actually about non-presidential conduct, as I have explained elsewhere. Trump and his lawyers repeatedly commit the fallacy that any time he does something, that makes it official conduct. But that is not what the Supreme Court ruled, and in fact at the Manhattan trial prosecutors adeptly limited the questioning to unofficial conduct.  As Bragg’s office stated in responding to Trump’s request to delay his sentencing, it “is correct that the denial of immunity from prosecution is immediately appealable” — i.e., it would be appealable before trial. “But here, in contrast to defendant’s criminal case in D.C., the question of defendant’s immunity from prosecution is not presented.” That’s because the dispute ultimately concerns the admission of evidence about events during Trump’s presidency, and the DA’s office explained that the “Supreme Court’s recent decision did not consider whether a trial court’s ruling on that distinct evidentiary question is immediately appealable, and there are strong reasons why it should not be.” Criminal appeals are generally decided after defendants are sentenced. There is no reason here to divert from that well-established practice that ensures the prompt and orderly administration of justice. No other defendant would be allowed this pause. Neither should Trump be if we are to live up to the American principle that no one is above the law. Trump’s other arguments fare no better. He also says that the sentencing should be delayed until after the election to “prospectively mitigate the asserted conflicts and appearances of impropriety” that it alleges would infect any sentencing hearing held before the election. But the defense’s repeated claims that Merchan is biased have been consistently rejected by all authorities that have reviewed them, including the New York Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which previously concluded that “the judge’s impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.” In fact, delaying the sentencing until after the election might serve to increase appearances of impropriety. For example, if Trump is elected and then not sentenced to a period of incarceration (although I have argued incarceration would be appropriate given his crimes), the public might think he unfairly received a lighter sentence because he was elected president.  Trump also asserts that the sentencing should be delayed until after the election because doing so would supposedly prevent prosecutors “from filing a sentencing submission,” which would argue what sentence Merchan should impose, before the judge rules on Trump’s motion to vacate his conviction. The defense contends that such a submission would be “personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the Presidency.” But any such submission would not be public. Besides, Trump should not receive preferential treatment merely because he is a presidential candidate. Many criminal defendants are sentenced every day while they might be applying for jobs, yet they are not permitted to postpone their sentencing hearings until after they have completed all rounds of their job interviews. That this applicant is seeking the presidency of the United States does not change a thing.  The purposes of sentencing, whether retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence or incapacitation, are all frustrated when that sentencing is delayed. Given that Trump was convicted of feloniously interfering in the 2016 presidential election and charged federally and in Georgia with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the court should specifically deter him from committing more election crimes in 2024 by handing down its sentence without additional delay, even if the imposition of that sentence is ultimately delayed pending his appeals. A sentence of incarceration, which I have argued is otherwise merited, could protect American voters from imminent election crimes. Moreover, the sentencing hearing is likely to provide valuable information about not only the crimes of which Trump was convicted but also other aspects of his background. It will also allow voters to learn what the judge who oversaw his trial thinks about the seriousness of his crimes. American voters deserve to have that information before they decide whether to vote for defendant Trump in November. Trump should be denied the special treatment he seeks to delay his sentence simply because he is a presidential candidate. To avoid undermining public faith in the rule of law and fairness of the criminal justice system, Trump’s sentencing should go ahead as scheduled."
How Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are charting new territory in normcore,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-doritos-tim-walz-normal-trump-weird-rcna167193,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz single-handedly launched “weird” as the Democrats’ go-to insult for the MAGA crowd this summer. Now he and Vice President Kamala Harris, who has chosen Walz as the running mate in her presidential campaign, are fleshing out for voters the other side of the equation: what it looks like to be “normal.” And it’s going surprisingly well. In short videos shared over social media in recent days, Harris’ presidential campaign has generated a series of viral clips that capture private conversations between Harris and Walz that come across as intimate and improvised. The videos are warm in tone and often funny, and they show the candidates discussing mundane, apolitical topics like food and music.  Over the weekend, Walz posted a video on X showing the two of them searching for snacks at a rest stop during their “Road to Chicago” bus tour. Harris peruses one aisle alongside her husband while asking Walz, “Do you see corn nuts over there, Tim?” Walz then emerges from another with another snack: a big bag of Doritos. Harris gratefully grabs the bag, exclaiming “ah, yeah,” and then immediately continues to hunt for other snacks. The clip lasts just 10 seconds, but it’s strangely arresting. It showcases a scene instantly recognizable to just about any American: hungry road-trippers looking for and discussing their favorite snacks, a familiar blend of tedium and small delights. Whether the scene was in any way orchestrated, the pair come off as relatable humans, and they comport themselves in a way one rarely sees politicians do. Walz’s snack suggestion also incidentally doubles as a reference to Harris’ recent confession that she binged on a “family-sized bag of nacho Doritos” after President Donald Trump won the White House — another recent piece of normcore rhetoric. Harris’ campaign also released video last week of Harris and Walz getting to know each other filled with some genuinely funny moments. In a one-on-one exchange, Walz discloses his affection for “white guy tacos” — that is, tacos without spice — to the consternation of Harris, who reminds him she grew chili peppers at the vice president’s residence. In another moment, the two exchange their favorite music (Harris talks about her mother’s Aretha Franklin super fandom; Walz describes his love for Bruce Springsteen). They also released video of Harris’ first attempt to call Walz to officially ask him to be her running mate, which Walz accidentally missed. It’s impossible to know how much, if any, of these exchanges may have been discussed in advance. But it’s obvious that the conversations are heavily improvised. They’re politicians, not actors, and their laughter, jokes and commentary radiate the warmth of two people with conversational chemistry and a discernible interest in the world outside of politics. Even some of the videos capturing Harris and Walz’s campaign activities have a conspicuously casual tone, showing Harris petting dogs and campaigning once again in Converse Chuck Taylors. And Walz is a normcore warrior on the campaign trail, slamming Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance for faking kinship with the working class he scorns using references to food. Harris’ campaign has struck upon a fresh and surprisingly engaging communication strategy. All politicians want to appear as ordinary citizens who understand the way other ordinary citizens live. But achieving that often involves awkward contrivances, such as stuffing corn dogs into their mouths in front of hordes of journalists at a county fair. Harris’ campaign has avoided hokey press spectacles and instead leveraged smart video production and social media to brandish its normie credentials. Beyond being clever, Harris and Walz’s normcore aesthetic buttresses the emerging populist themes of Harris’ campaign as she goes about unveiling progressive economic policies on housing, medical debt and the child tax credit. And it marks a concerted attempt to contest the claim that far too many have bought: that Trump speaks on behalf of so-called real America. (It is difficult to imagine imperious billionaire Trump and his awkward, chameleon of a running mate, Vance, ever chatting it up so naturally anywhere, but especially not at a rest stop.) Harris cannot win an election based purely on impressive social media optics and normie vibes. Nor should she. But if she can make a substantive case for how she can make America and the world more just for the masses through progressive policies, then channeling the everywoman and everyman vibes will be more than just a convincing shtick."
Why this Florida school literally threw LGBTQ-friendly books into a dumpster,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 5:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/florida-new-college-book-ban-lgbtq-gender-studies-rcna166845,"On a quiet Tuesday afternoon in August, just a week before students were due to return to campus, the administration of New College of Florida emptied the library of the college’s Gender and Diversity Center by putting those books in a dumpster. They were joined shortly afterward by books from the main library, most on topics related to religion and LGBTQ+ issues.  According to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, New College claimed that by law it couldn’t donate or sell the books, but that’s false — it could have sold or transferred the property, so long as any sale was open to the public. In the past, if space needed to be made and old books removed, students were notified and many of books were claimed. But that didn’t happen here. The book purge happened in the summer, before anyone returned to campus — and as the Herald-Tribune reported, students said they weren’t notified — and before long the vast majority were carted off to the landfill. The books included ""When I Knew,"" a collection of essays about queer self-discovery; an intermediate Hebrew language workbook; and a classic work of medieval European history, John Boswell’s ""Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe."" Christopher Rufo, a right-wing culture warrior appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis as a trustee of New College, has espoused a vision for the college as a “public university, open to all, in which exceptional students of any background can participate in the great tradition of the West.” As part of that new mission, Rufo and the rest of the trustees spearheaded the removal of the program in gender studies at New College, claiming that the discipline was “ideological activism” and that it didn’t fit with the mission of a university. Students and faculty — the ones most affected by this decision — strenuously objected, but were ignored. The dumpster full of books completes this mission that began in August 2023. Rufo posted on X, “We abolished the gender studies program. Now we’re throwing out the trash.” So much for the university’s protestations of innocence.  Although it may seem paradoxical, Rufo’s evocation of “western civilization” sits squarely within a tradition of authoritarians controlling access to knowledge, taking books away from people “for their own good.” There’s lots of history of right-wing takeovers of universities during the 20th century, including the destruction of books about gender and sexuality in 1930s Germany, but as medievalists we see comparisons that stretch further back — much further back. In 1240, King Louis IX of France (also known as St. Louis) decided, without consulting the Jewish community, that the Talmud — the primary text of Jewish law — was “dangerous.” He decided that, in fact, this sacred book that had been used for nearly a millennium was heretical and that the Jews had strayed from “Biblical Judaism” and into error with their newfangled medieval Rabbinic Jewish practice. Louis IX, he told himself, was just the guy to help them out. The Talmud was put on trial, the book literally prosecuted by the chancellor of the University of Paris, the bishop of Paris, the archbishop of Sens and other Christian clerics, with the “case” presided over by Louis’ mother. But the outcome was predetermined. Even as the Jewish community protested, the king seized all the manuscript copies of the Talmud he could lay his hands on. Then, in June 1241, in a square in Paris just across the river from Notre-Dame, he burned those cartloads of books.  In the 13th century, Louis didn’t really care about the Jews nor the Talmud; he was worried about the state of his Christian kingdom, about getting right with God by punishing non-Christians, so that he could literally launch another crusade to the Holy Land. But Louis wasn’t content with controlling what the Jews read; he attempted to convert them by force and threatened to expel any Jews who kept their own copies of the banned books. In 1268, he ordered all the Jews of France to be arrested and have their assets seized. But there was another path. In the 13th century, just across the River Seine from the pyre of burning books, students at the University of Paris (including luminaries like St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas Aquinas) were studying Jewish and Islamic philosophy with such relish that they were dismissed by outsiders as ideologues. History doesn’t repeat, but sometimes it echoes.  The desecration at New College wasn’t the first time and won’t be the last time that ideology trumps the pursuit of knowledge. But if the American right wants to talk about western civilization, then let’s tell the whole story.  Would-be tyrants have been destroying books for centuries, and once you start destroying books, it’s usually not long until you treat groups of people the same way. Purging books according to one’s personal ideology goes against everything that the university stands for.  Here in the 21st century, the leaders of New College who are and dumping books “in the great tradition of the West” don’t really care about their students any more than their fellow travelers from the Middle Ages, who cared more about their own crusades than the free and open pursuit of an education."
Biden’s right that we need new innovations in cancer care. Here’s what we need more.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-cancer-moonshot-first-step-faces-challenges-rcna166604,"At New Orleans’ Tulane University last week, President Joe Biden announced the awarding of $150 million for cancer research through Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), another accomplishment of his “Cancer Moonshot.” The award will go to eight teams around the country for projects that aim to improve the methods by which surgeons remove cancerous tumors. In his remarks, Biden stated that the fund has “set its sights on a big idea: calling on researchers and innovators to pioneer new techniques and technologies to make cancer removal more precise, accurate, successful.” “Imagine cancer surgery that removes all the tumor, the first time, without harming healthy cells,” he said. This announcement marks a goalpost in the Cancer Moonshot work Biden led as vice president, first announced in 2016, the year after his 46-year-old son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. The original Moonshot promised to “make a decade’s worth of advances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, in five years” and “end cancer as we know it.” President Biden re-emphasized this commitment in 2022, including the more specific goal of reducing the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years.  The term “moonshot” used to refer to something that was highly unlikely. However, after we actually landed on the moon, it came to mean something difficult but achievable. Indeed, cancer experts have said the ambitious goals of Biden’s Cancer Moonshot can be achieved. Cancer has been the second most common cause of death in the U.S. for nearly 90 years. It’s the leading cause of death for those under the age of 85. Last year, more than 613,000 people died of cancer, similar to the population of Memphis, Tennessee. More than half of U.S. families have been affected by cancer; 40% of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in our lifetimes. President Biden is among those Americans. Not only did he lose his son Beau to brain cancer, but the president and first lady Jill Biden have had cancerous skin lesions identified and successfully removed. There aren’t that many Americans who think we’ve spent too much money trying to solve cancer; a third or more think we spend too little. However, Biden’s latest announcement regarding increased funding for cancer treatment innovations comes at a time when overall federal funding for scientific agencies is down. That’s why an announcement of this kind is a golden retriever of health causes: it’s widely endearing, politically popular and it has traditionally been bipartisan. Even so, this Moonshot faces significant challenges. First, cancer is a bit of a whack-a-mole; its occurrence changes as our environment and population change. The role of specific cancer risks, including factors like obesity and environmental exposures to poor air and toxic waste, shift over time and across geographic locations. Climate-related events influence people’s exposure to cancer risks and access to cancer care. Our population is aging, and, thus, is more vulnerable to cancer. At the same time, increases in cancer among middle-aged and younger people reflect the impact of evolving risk factors.  Second, though the projects Biden announced funding for last week will employ cool cutting-edge techniques for treatment of cancers, it’s important to remember that solving cancer involves both the front end (prevention and early detection) and the tail end (treatment). “We cannot treat our way out of the rising cancer caseload. The only solution is a full-scale defense, so that nobody suffers the disease in the first place,” Madeline Drexler, editor of Harvard Public Health has written. This year’s data from the American Cancer Society details declines in cancer mortality achieved largely from reductions in lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death, driven by reductions in smoking. Treatment innovations, including immunotherapy, have led to improved survival rates for certain types of cancer. However, several of the most common cancers, including those in the breast, pancreas, liver, kidney and prostate, are increasing in incidence, and need a huge boost in prevention efforts.  Further, a striking emphasis within the ACS data is how much progress is impeded by persistent racial and ethnic health disparities in prevention, access to care and survival rates. For example, rates of uterine corpus cancer, the fourth most common type of cancer among women, have been increasing by about 1% per year overall, but is increasing by more than 2% per year among Black, Hispanic, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women. Alarmingly, survival rates are going down, and within that finding are breathtaking racial disparities: The five-year survival rate for Black women is 63%, but 84% for white women; Black women have more provider visits preceding diagnosis and are less likely to receive appropriate testing; once diagnosed, they are less likely to receive appropriate treatment. As a result, Black women have lower survival rates at every stage of diagnosis. Although this stage of the Moonshot is about funding scientific discoveries, the fight against cancer cannot be just about discoveries. Dazzling scientific successes don’t mean much if we can’t consistently apply them and if we can’t address the systematic and structural barriers that keep a significant proportion of the population from accessing those discoveries. “If all innovation ended today and we could just get people access to the innovations that we know about right now, we think we could reduce cancer mortality by another 20 to 30%,” Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, has said. To be fair, the full agenda of the Cancer Moonshot addresses issues of access, prevention, screening, access to care and health inequities, as well as scientific advances. The treatment innovations themselves should demonstrate that they are consciously designed for a heterogenous population, that studies are performed across a broadly representative population and that outcomes are strong across populations defined by race, ethnicity, rurality, income and location. Further, innovation funding should demonstrate an awareness of how the disparities we see in care are reflected in research commitments, too. One study demonstrated that prostate cancer received an average of $1,821,000 per person-years of life lost. Uterine cancer? Just $57,000.  “Imagine clinical trials that bring innovation to all communities,” said Biden, in his remarks at Tulane. The Cancer Moonshot is like building a rocket; we just need to make sure it can reach every American who needs it."
"In effort to woo women voters, Trump employs blatant racism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-racism-truth-social-post-women-voters-rcna167264,"Here’s a quick follow-up of sorts to a post from last week, when I wrote about Donald Trump’s campaign relying on racist and xenophobic claims that resemble campaign materials from the early 20th century. Trump gave us another example Sunday, when he reshared a social media post with footage of dark-skinned people walking in line. The accompanying text said: “If you’re a woman you can either vote for Trump or wait until one of these monsters goes after you or your daughter.” Trump’s campaign is maniacally focused on anti-immigrant fearmongering, so, much like with that post, the message here seems clear enough, no? In essence: “Women, fear the dark-skinned people” — and not the old white men who want to wield control over your body (and your daughter’s) and keep you in abusive marriages. This was straight-up “Birth of a Nation”-style racism being promoted by the standard-bearer of the Republican Party.

Kamala Harris faces huge test on Gaza at DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 2:52 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-dnc-test-israel-gaza-rcna167217,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 18 episode of ""Ayman."" As the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago, polls show that the presidential race is shifting in Democrats’ favor. Since President Joe Biden dropped out, the party has rallied around Vice President Kamala Harris and public opinion has followed.  The emergence of Harris as a presidential contender and the selection of Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate have breathed new life into the Democratic Party — injecting supporters with excitement, hope and even joy.  However, a lot can change between now and November. Harris is still in a neck-and-neck race with Donald Trump, a man convicted of 34 felony counts who tried to overturn the last election. It’s clear the stakes of this convention couldn’t be any higher. In her first few weeks as the Democratic nominee, Harris has already proven herself capable of making big and bold decisions. When most Democratic strategists wanted her to pick a running mate with the pundit-approved label of “centrist” or “moderate,” she went her own way and selected Walz, who has successfully passed a progressive agenda as governor.  Last week, knowing that Republicans stood ready to label her a socialist or even a communist, she unveiled a populist economic agenda, including a plan to combat price gouging by grocery store chains. However, there is one issue on which she has not yet displayed this boldness or willingness to confront powerful interests. It’s the same issue that sunk Biden in the polls long before his disastrous debate performance. As Farah Stockman wrote in The New York Times: The key word there is “substance.” Harris has already proven adept at showing more compassion and empathy toward Palestinians than does Biden, who came across to some as cold, cruel and clueless.  But that bar is extremely low. Empty words won’t bring back the more than 40,000 Palestinians, including more than 16,000 children, who have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in these last 10 months, according to health officials in Gaza. The American position can’t be “I feel your pain” while we’re the ones supplying bombs causing that pain. That’s why more than 150 groups nationwide have joined a coalition to march at the DNC with estimates that tens of thousands will be there protesting. How Harris and the Democrats deal with this — not just the protests themselves but the substance of this issue — may be her biggest test heading into the DNC."

Cornel West's campaign exposing right-wing trickery as it implodes,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 2:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cornel-west-arizona-republicans-presidential-election-2024-rcna167252,"Cornel West’s presidential campaign appears to be combusting — and, in the process, exposing some mischievous inner workings. The unaffiliated West was disqualified from appearing on the ballot in Michigan last week over notary issues and amid concerns about the authenticity of the signatures he acquired. Now, The Associated Press reports that West has been disqualified in Arizona, as well — but the story of the last-ditch effort to keep West on the ballot out there speaks to the dubiousness of his MAGA-fueled campaign.  The report explains how conservative activists tried to coordinate electors willing to help West get on ballots this November in an apparent effort to pull potential liberal votes from the Democratic candidate. This follows an NBC News report in June claiming operatives aligned with Republicans had been working to obtain signatures to qualify West in various states.  Per The Associated Press: Late last week, Mitchell claimed her signature had been “forged” on documents identifying her as a potential elector for West. The latest AP report says attorney Paul Hamrick spoke with Judie via phone and that well-known conservative lawyers Amanda Reeve and Brett Johnson were captured on surveillance footage visiting Judie’s home after he allegedly backed out of an offer to support West as an elector. The Associated Press describes the attempt to recruit electors for West as what “appears to be part of a broader effort by conservative activists and Republican-aligned operatives across the country to push West’s candidacy and subvert the integrity of the ballot in the months leading up to November’s presidential election.” Hamrick told the AP that the allegations against him are “false,” while the two other lawyers didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The conservative chicanery being alleged has always seemed highly likely, considering how West’s campaign began. When West launched his presidential bid last year, I explained his campaign’s curious ties to the conservative movement, including his praise for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ultraconservative education agenda, his association with right-wing conspiracy theorist Russell Brand, and the fact he initially launched his bid as a member of the far-right-friendly People’s Party. That West received a maximum donation from conservative megadonor Harlan Crow — and returned it after facing backlash — only added to the suspicion.  And Trump, for the record, is acutely aware that long-shot, ostensibly liberal candidates such as West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein being in the race only helps him. But now, more than ever, we're seeing the lengths conservatives have been willing to travel to prop up West, with hopes they can use him to help Trump win."
Donald Trump says America is in decline. He couldn't be more wrong.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 1:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/donald-trump-america-decline-republicans-rcna167237,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 19 episode of ""Morning Joe."" On Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump once again called the United States a “nation in decline.”  For any Republicans out there who may want to follow down Trump’s trail, let me give you some facts: America is a great nation, and the overwhelming majority of Americans — the ones who will be voting for or against you this fall — agree with me. We have fed and freed more people through the years than any other country on the planet. We are economically stronger relative to the rest of the world. The Dow is higher than it’s ever been — far higher than when Trump was president. Trump loves to say, “Drill, baby, drill,” and although some Democrats may not like it, if you look at the U.S. and its oil production, we have produced more oil this past year than any other country in history.  We are also the strongest military power in the world. Even our enemies understand we’re not a nation in decline. Trump is always talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin and what a great leader he is. But the fact is, Texas has a higher GDP than the entirety of Russia. Culturally, there’s also America’s reach in soft power. Just look at Taylor Swift going through Europe and the economic boom that is for those countries. It’s exhausting to hear Trump and other Republicans say we’re a failing country. It’s not true. America is stronger than it’s ever been. I challenge Trump to find a measurement that would suggest we’re a nation in decline. It’s a strange form of patriotism to say that America is only great if one leader is in power, and that if that leader is not in power then America is in decline.

George Santos pleads guilty in federal fraud case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 1:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/george-santos-pleads-guilty-federal-fraud-case-rcna167131,"Former Republican U.S. Rep. George Santos pleaded guilty in federal court on Monday, avoiding a trial that was set for next month on criminal charges including wire fraud, false statements, aggravated identity theft and theft of public funds.    Santos pleaded guilty to two counts — wire fraud and aggravated identity theft — and faces a minimum of two years in prison, NBC News reported, with sentencing set for Feb. 7. As part of the plea agreement, Santos will pay restitution of $373,749.97 and forfeiture of $205,002.97. By pleading guilty, the expelled congressman from New York avoids potentially more severe punishment had he been found guilty at trial. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has noted that federal trial sentences “are roughly three times higher than plea sentences for the same crime on average and sometimes as much as eight or ten times higher,” and that “only 2-3% of federal convictions are the result of trial.”   While guilty pleas are common, Monday’s proceeding highlights the outlandish if brief political tenure of Santos, whose brazen lies managed to stand out even in Washington. My colleague Steve Benen pointed out, upon Santos’ congressional expulsion last year, that “Capitol Hill has featured plenty of scandal-plagued members in recent generations, but successful expulsion votes have only happened three times since the Civil War.” The expulsion followed a House ethics report that said Santos “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” In his criminal case, Santos was accused of “stealing people’s identities and making charges on his own donors’ credit cards without their authorization, lying to the [Federal Election Commission] and, by extension, the public about the financial state of his campaign,” Eastern District of New York U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in announcing a superseding indictment last year. “Santos falsely inflated the campaign’s reported receipts with non-existent loans and contributions that were either fabricated or stolen,” Peace said, adding that Santos “allegedly led multiple additional fraudulent criminal schemes, lying to the American public in the process.”  Also on Monday, a federal judge dismissed the civil lawsuit Santos brought against talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, ABC and Disney for copyright infringement and related claims. The suit stemmed from Kimmel’s use of videos on his late-night show made by Santos on the Cameo website, where celebrities record personalized messages for money. Kimmel had a segment called “Will Santos Say It?” in which the host sent a number of what he called “ridiculous requests.” “I didn’t say they were from me. I just wrote them and sent them to find out: Will Santos say it?"" Kimmel explained to his audience ahead of the segment in December 2023. Rejecting Santos’ claim, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in the Southern District of New York wrote that a reasonable observer would understand that Kimmel showed the videos “to comment on the willingness of Santos — a public figure who had recently been expelled from Congress for allegedly fraudulent activity including enriching himself through a fraudulent contribution scheme — to say absurd things for money.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Harris and Walz are hitting Trump where it hurts: his masculinity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 11:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-rally-trump-masculinity-gender-attacks-rcna167214,"During a campaign stop in Rochester, Pennsylvania, over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris lobbed a volley in her war on Donald Trump’s hypermasculine ways, criticizing the “perversion” and “coward”-like behavior undergirding the bravado. It was a nice reversal of the usual gendered rhetoric. Trump’s attacks on Harris have dripped with misogyny and general creepiness since she emerged as the Democratic nominee. He’s repeatedly insulted her intelligence; lately, he’s resorted to commenting about her physical appearance as well. Meanwhile, the campaign and allies in conservative media have tried to broaden his appeal with male voters while deploying some rather juvenile tactics. But Trump’s increasingly hypermasculine persona — a toxic mixture of Al Bundy from ""Married ... With Children"" and Biff Tannen from “Back to the Future” — arguably gives Democrats an opening. Even when President Joe Biden was still running, Democrats made concerted efforts to attack Trump’s performative masculinity and bullying behavior to discourage men from following in his path. And the Harris-Walz ticket has afforded Democrats more opportunity to attack toxic MAGA masculinity, with an uncowed woman leading the ticket and her running mate offering a comparatively kinder, more compassionate depiction of masculinity than is being offered by Trump and his followers.  And Harris launched a pointed attack of her own on Sunday, contrasting how her campaign perceives strength with how … others … do.  She said:  Harris didn’t need to mention Trump by name for viewers to know who she was referencing. The sentiment here — that bullies are cowardly and weak at heart — aligns with comments Tim Walz made about the MAGA movement when he was being considered as Harris’ potential running mate. I’m on the record with my belief that these kinds of attacks on Trumpy hypermasculinity are likely to be valuable for Democrats. Trump and his movement portray strength as the key to manhood. And we know one of his key metrics for strength is one’s ability to vanquish or humiliate his political foes. The fact a campaign led by a Black woman is taking him to task for this “perverse” idea seems likely to goad him into more misogynistic outbursts, which don’t appear to be helping him.  And simultaneously, in attacking Trump’s bullying behavior, the Harris-Walz campaign can do lasting good by arguing — to all Americans, but certainly, the men who need it most — that true power is about aiding others, not trampling on them."
"Kamala Harris isn’t done picking up support from GOP, conservatives",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 11:09 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 19, 2024, 11:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-isnt-done-picking-support-gop-conservatives-rcna167223,"It’s probably fair to say that J. Michael Luttig is not a household name, but in conservative legal circles, the retired federal judge has few rivals. As Politico noted a couple of years ago, the jurist has spent much of his adult life operating “at the top of the conservative legal world.” As regular readers might recall, Luttig served as an attorney in the Reagan White House, a clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and one of the nation’s most prominent conservative judges — overseeing clerks with familiar Republican names such as Ted Cruz and John Eastman. Not surprisingly, during some recent Republican administrations, Luttig was considered for the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, when then-Vice President Mike Pence and his team weighed their legal options after the 2020 election, the retired judge was the voice they sought out. (Luttig told them to follow the law. They did.) In the years that followed, Luttig took fresh steps to distance himself from his ostensible allies on the right, becoming one of the star witnesses in the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings. A year ago, the retired jurist said American democracy is in “grave peril” because of the radicalization of GOP politics. “American democracy simply cannot function without two equally healthy and equally strong political parties,” Luttig said last August. “So today, in my view, there is no Republican Party to counter the Democratic Party in the country.” It’s against this backdrop that the retired judge is also endorsing the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. CNN reported: “In the presidential election of 2024 there is only one political party and one candidate for the presidency that can claim the mantle of defender and protector of America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law,” Luttig wrote in a statement obtained by CNN. “As a result, I will unhesitatingly vote for the Democratic Party’s candidate for the Presidency of the United States, Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.” This comes on the heels of Harris also picking up support from two former Republican congresswomen: Virginia’s Barbara Comstock and New York’s Susan Molinari. (When the latter was asked why she’s supporting the vice president, Molinari said Harris is “smart,” “strong,” “knows how to handle herself on the world stage,” and is “not crazy.”) Two weeks ago, Republicans for Harris launched to some fanfare. The effort appears to be growing, which should probably make Trump and his team nervous."

Ari Melber will anchor from New York. At 8 p.m. ET, Rachel Maddow, Jen Psaki, Chris Hayes, Lawrence O'Donnell and Stephanie Ruhle will join the coverage. NBC News Now will stream live from the convention starting at 4 p.m. ET. And NBC News will have special coverage at 9 p.m. ET. Most major networks will offer prime-time coverage of the convention. The DNC will also stream live on its website beginning at 6:15 p.m. ET on Monday and at 7 p.m. ET for the rest of the days. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, the last night of the convention. Several high-profile Democrats are set to address the DNC, including President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and more. See the list of speakers here. Former President Donald Trump's speech on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention last month drew nearly 25.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen. It marked an increase in viewership from the final night of the 2020 RNC but a decline from his 2016 RNC speech. An estimated 24.6 million tuned in for the final night of the 2020 DNC, in which Biden formally accepted his party's presidential nomination, Nielsen said. Time will tell whether Harris’ address on Thursday pulls in a similar audience."
Manhattan prosecutors leave it to Judge Merchan whether to delay Trump’s sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-sentencing-bragg-letter-merchan-rcna167165,"Judge Juan Merchan has another tough decision to make in Donald Trump’s New York criminal case. After Trump’s lawyers last week pushed to delay sentencing in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office says it’s deferring to the judge about whether to do so. Merchan had set the former president’s sentencing for Sept. 18, two days after the judge is poised to rule on Trump’s motion to set aside his guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. In their letter last week, Trump’s lawyers said that if Merchan rejects their immunity-related motion, then they intend to immediately appeal, and they argued that it would be unfair to sentence their client in the meantime as he runs for president again. In their response made public Monday, Manhattan prosecutors disagreed with multiple points in the letter but ultimately deferred to Merchan on whether to keep the Sept. 18 sentencing. The state noted that, unlike Trump’s federal election interference case that led to the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling, the issue here isn’t whether the charged acts in the so-called hush money case are immune from prosecution; the issue in New York is whether any official-act evidence used to prove Trump’s guilt of unofficial conduct ran afoul of the high court ruling such that Trump’s guilty verdicts need to be overturned prior to sentencing. Trump was found guilty in May of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. “The Supreme Court’s recent decision did not consider whether a trial court’s ruling on that distinct evidentiary question is immediately appealable, and there are strong reasons why it should not be,” prosecutors wrote to Merchan in their letter dated Aug. 16. “Nonetheless, given the defense’s newly stated position, we defer to the Court on whether an adjournment is warranted to allow for orderly appellate litigation of that question, or to reduce the risk of a disruptive stay from an appellate court pending consideration of that question,” the prosecutors continued, adding that they’re prepared for sentencing whenever it takes place. Acknowledging the reality of the situation, prosecutors added in a footnote: So in addition to pointing out the “significant public safety and logistical steps by multiple agencies” needed to prepare for Trump’s court appearances, the prosecution’s letter suggests that keeping the Sept. 18 date could be all for naught, given Trump’s intention to immediately appeal the likely impending denial of his motion by Merchan. Of course, if Merchan sides with Trump on Sept. 16, then there won’t be a sentencing to contend with. “The defendant’s newly-stated position concerning an immediate appeal ... may mean that significant preparatory steps are taken, only to have such steps disturbed by appellate litigation,” prosecutors wrote, referring to a potential appeal of the motion on which Merchan is set to rule Sept. 16. The prosecution’s letter is the latest reminder of how broadly the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. United States can favor the GOP presidential nominee. While Trump has already benefited from that ruling, the full extent to which he does so remains to be seen in all of his criminal cases. In the meantime, Merchan has yet another difficult decision to make in this unique prosecution when it comes to this scheduling matter. The judge stressed to the parties earlier this month (before Trump’s letter last week) that the Sept. 18 date remained unchanged. The prosecution’s letter could complicate matters for the judge, but we’ll learn from Merchan himself in an order that could come anytime now.

Trump’s unsettling new question: ‘Why are we having an election?’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 10:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-unsettling-new-question-are-election-rcna167196,"By all appearances, Donald Trump really doesn’t like it when Democrats describe him as a threat to democracy, and yet, the Republican keeps saying things that reflect a degree of animosity toward the American system of government. Take the former president’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, for example. The New York Times reported: The context for these off-the-cuff comments was a bit of a mess. The GOP candidate, holding a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, was speaking about inflation when he apparently had a thought. “You know, they do polls on this stuff, and I’m at like 93%,” Trump said, referring to surveys that apparently exist in his imagination. “I said, ‘So why are we having an election? They didn’t have an election. Why are we having an election?’” And at that point, he moved on, lamenting the fact that President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Honestly, it’s not clear exactly what Trump was trying to say. Evidently, he’s still outraged that the Democratic Party didn’t go through a traditional nominating process before rallying behind Vice President Kamala Harris. The “they” in his quote, in other words, referred to his Democratic rivals. It was less obvious who Trump was referring to with “we.” To be sure, it was a rhetorical question, but “we” are having an election because that’s how we make decisions in the United States. It’s tempting to think Trump was complaining about the asymmetry — he had to go through GOP primaries and caucuses, nearly all of which he won with relative ease — but he was speaking entirely in the present tense. “Why are we having an election?” couldn’t refer to Republican nominating contests that wrapped up months ago. Charitable observers might be inclined to shrug this off, and as best as I can tell, the comments didn’t generate a lot of pickup over the weekend. But let’s not forget that Trump has spent recent weeks repeatedly saying that he and his political operation “don’t need” votes — a curious comment from a candidate for public office — which has dovetailed with his comments a few weeks ago that his Christian supporters “won’t have to vote anymore” if he wins a second term. Soon after, given a chance to walk that back, the GOP nominee instead doubled-down on the rhetoric. This is the same White House hopeful who’s raised the prospect of creating what he’s pitched as a temporary American “dictatorship,” refused to accept his electoral defeat four years ago, talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, and arguing that his rivals shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him. It’s against this backdrop that Trump asked his supporters, “Why are we having an election?” as if this were a legitimate question. It isn’t."
The head of Project 2025 called my kids' favorite playground 'anti-family',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 9:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-swampoodle-dog-park-rcna166791,"The head of a conservative think tank went out in a D.C. neighborhood one day and came away with more evidence for his view that childless liberals are leading America astray: a dog park. To be more specific, a combination dog park and playground. Located in the hip NoMa area of Washington — named for the fact that it's north of Massachusetts Avenue — Swampoodle Park is only about 8,000 square feet, making it not much larger than a convenience store parking lot. Most of the space is home to a dog park, with one side set aside for a tall, narrow playground structure. For Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, who was a major force behind the controversial Project 2025 proposals to shape a second Donald Trump term, the park's use of land is tilted too heavily in favor of purportedly childless dog owners and away from parents, something he blames in an upcoming book on “the antifamily culture shaping legislation, regulation, and enforcement,"" according to galleys obtained by Media Matters. I don't have a dog, but I do have four young kids and I live in Washington, D.C. As a result, I have been to a lot of playgrounds in the greater metro area in the last few years. I have driven as long as an hour just to try out a new playground in some distant suburb in Virginia and Maryland and always get immediate feedback from my own focus group of four kids. After all that, I consider myself something of a playground connoisseur. So trust me when I say this: Roberts is wrong. Swampoodle is awesome. Now, it's not in the top tier of D.C.-area parks. The best playgrounds are obviously the big ones: the zip line and climbing towers at the Beauvoir Playground next to the Washington National Cathedral, the cool metal structures at the Lafayette-Pointer Recreation Center, or if you're willing to head a little farther out, the Wizard of Oz-themed playground in Maryland and the superlong slides at the suburban Wheaton Regional Park. But when I'm driving around town with my kids, it's the ""green playground"" at Swampoodle that they ask about the most. If you visit the park with kids, you'll quickly see why. The playground structure that Roberts criticizes is actually an intricate maze of slides and ladders that leads kids upwards. It's such a brilliant use of a small space that the first time I went, I took multiple photos and texted them to my dad, who works as an urban planner. It's even sturdy enough for an adult man to climb around inside, or so I've heard. And that's not all. While kids are moving up the structure — their favorite direction — they can see the dogs. More than a few games of tag on the playground have come to an abrupt halt because the kids wanted to gawk at a particularly cute Labradoodle puppy running around the dog park next door. Roberts is right that this area of D.C. could use more parks. Once a rundown part of town, it rapidly developed when local property owners rallied to add a Metro station. Block-sized apartment buildings with a Starbucks store on the first floor sprung up seemingly overnight. The city surely missed a chance years ago to set aside some of that land for green space before property values skyrocketed. But that didn't stop its new residents. A few years ago, they began treating an undeveloped lot as an informal dog park. Eventually they joined together to petition the city to make it official. During that process, someone suggested that they add a playground and everyone agreed that was a good idea. The name Swampoodle, which comes from a nickname Irish immigrants had for the swampy puddle-filled area back in the day, was then chosen through a public vote. Earlier this year, the park was even expanded across the street with a new section for younger kids. The nonprofit that supports the park, Friends of NoMa Dogs, put out a response to the book, noting that many residents have both dogs and kids and that everyone appreciates the ""family-friendly environment where pets and kids can safely play."" In Roberts' book, he describes a country in which people without children and people with children are at war, with selfish apartment-dwelling liberal dog owners scheming to deprive long-suffering conservative parents of valuable resources. It's a zero-sum vision of politics that's also being promoted by vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who sees ""childless cat ladies"" as a problem. The United States could do more to be family-friendly, as thoughtful conservatives like Tim Carney have written. But the very park Roberts singles out to criticize disproves his argument that this is because of some kind of aggressive war on families by the childless. Swampoodle is great for dogs and kids. The next time Roberts walks by a playground he doesn't like, he should check to see if the kids actually like it."

Republicans’ anti-Biden impeachment report lands with a thud,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 8:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-anti-biden-impeachment-report-lands-thud-rcna167172,"American history is filled with examples of ridiculous congressional investigations, but the House GOP’s crusade against President Joe Biden is certainly among the most cringeworthy. Even plenty of Republicans have admitted as much. Following months of humiliating failures, Politico reported in the spring that behind the scenes, GOP officials were quietly admitting that House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer’s impeachment crusade had been “hobbled by embarrassing setbacks.” Punchbowl News, meanwhile, quoted a House Republican leadership aide who said Comer and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan were “becoming the chairmen who cried wolf.” The more they tried to get their investigation back on track, the more embarrassing their investigation became. It now appears the entire effort has run its course and come to an ignominious end. NBC News reported: The full, 291-page document is available online, but by any fair measure, it lands with a thud: The House Republicans’ report breaks no new ground and presents no credible evidence of wrongdoing. What’s more, Comer, Jordan, et al. released the findings while members are still on vacation and Capitol Hill is quiet, probably in the hopes of embarrassing the incumbent president ahead of his appearance at the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. Of course, in order to actually embarrass Biden, the report would have to include damaging information. This one does not. Making matters worse, it has no doubt occurred to the far-right committee chairmen that they’ve failed on multiple levels: House Republicans spent a year and a half desperately searching for evidence of crimes that were never committed, in the hopes of undermining a Democratic incumbent’s re-election plans that were ultimately put aside. In other words, GOP lawmakers failed to make a compelling case against a candidate who’s retiring anyway. So, what happens now? In theory, the impeachment report will be referred to House Republican leaders who will decide whether to hold an impeachment vote against the president. In practice, GOP leaders know they don’t have the votes to impeach the president without credible evidence of wrongdoing, so this entire misguided ordeal will likely fade into oblivion. As for Comer’s reputation, it appears unlikely to recover. The Kentuckian’s fellow Republicans have used words like “clueless” and “embarrassing” to describe his anti-Biden investigation, and the scope and scale of his fiasco won’t soon be forgotten."
Why Trump is ignoring Republican calls to focus on policy and issues,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 7:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ignoring-republican-calls-focus-policy-issues-rcna167151,"The more Donald Trump targets Kamala Harris with personal attacks, the more Republican officials try to convince the former president to try a more substantive and constructive course. So far, he has ignored the suggestions. But those hoping to steer him in a smarter direction keep trying anyway. The New York Times reported: Around the same time, Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” and delivered a similar line. “President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America, and if you have a policy debate for president, he wins,” the South Carolina Republican told host Kristen Welker. “Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.” The intraparty pitch is entirely straightforward: Trump has a substantive advantage, the argument goes, so if he can show some message discipline and stick to policy, his candidacy will benefit accordingly. And why, pray tell, is the former president ignoring this advice? There are a few reasons, actually. Trump doesn’t care about governing. In fact, he never has. (I wrote a book about this four years ago, exploring the problem in more detail.) There’s a reason the GOP candidate delivered a speech on economic policy last week that largely ignored economy policy: This guy just isn’t interested in talking about substantive issues, no matter how many people urge him to care. Trump doesn’t know how to talk about policy. Even if Trump could be convinced to pretend to care about governing, he’d quickly run into a related problem, which is even more serious: He can’t fake it well. Indeed, one of his signature issues is trade tariffs, and whenever he tries to talk about them, the Republican reminds the public that he still doesn’t understand his own idea at the most basic level. Trump almost certainly knows his ideas are unpopular. The former president has some goals he’s interested in pursuing, but they’re not exactly the sort of things that win over swing voters. Among Trump’s priorities are tax breaks for the wealthy, pardons for politically aligned criminals, abortion restrictions, and the creation of a temporary American “dictatorship.” Even if one were inclined to put aside the radioactive unpopularity of the Project 2025 agenda — written in large part by members of Trump’s own team — the GOP nominee’s own stated ideas are political losers, too. As Dan Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts, summarized last week, “This explains why Republicans in general and Trump in particular have become so flummoxed. The larger Republican party is keenly aware that Trump’s personal attacks on Harris will not redound to the GOP’s benefit. But neither can they talk about their actual policy platform because most of it is hideously unpopular.” No wonder Republicans seem so anxious about the ticket’s messaging."

Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Claire McCaskill: Hello, and welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Thursday morning on August 15th. I’m Claire McCaskill, and I’m here with a very special co-pilot today, my dearest bestest buddy, Heidi Heitkamp. She is the former Senator from North Dakota. She is also the Co-Founder and Chair of the One Country Project, co-host the Hot Dish podcast with her brother Joel, and has a very big and important job running the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. If you’re not familiar with the Institute of Politics, go look it up. They do amazing work, getting kids engaged that are attending the University of Chicago, and Heidi is doing great work there. All right, Heidi, what do you think? Heidi Heitkamp: I’m going to give a plug because we are bringing almost 300 students to the Democratic Convention, it’s a non-partisan event, to talk about getting out the youth vote and to do training on getting out the youth vote. And so, I’m very excited. We did it at the RNC and we’re doing it at the DNC. We think it’s so important at the Institute of Politics and important for our democracy to get people, at a minimum, young people, in the habit of voting and then building out opportunities to run for office. So, we’re very excited. Claire McCaskill: And I’m sure I’ll see you in Chicago next week, so. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes, we’re counting on it. Claire McCaskill: We’ll have a chance to hug. Okay, there’s 82 days to go, and Heidi and I know how intense the coming sprint can be for any candidate. You know who’s having a real hard time keeping focus and laying out his policy vision. Yes, that would be Donald J. Trump. We’ll assess how badly he’s flailing as everyone in his party is urging him to pivot to the issues and quit talking about Hannibal Lecter. And now that the polls have had a chance to bake in a bit with the shift to the Harris-Walz ticket, Dave Wasserman, the Senior Editor and Elections Analyst for “The Cook Political Report”, is going to lay out what the polls are cautiously indicating for the presidency and how the map is shaping up for the down-ballot races in the Senate, in the House, and even governorships. But first, Heidi, let’s talk some strategy. And, you know, we do a thing in this podcast, “If I were in the room.” So I think it’d be fun for us, Heidi, to do “If I were in the room” for the Trump campaign. I mean, I don’t even know what to say. I mean, this guy is so off his game. It is unbelievable to watch. You know, flailing is an understatement. He’s got everybody in his party panicked, and I’d love to hear your take on what do you think is going on and is it possible for him to correct course at this point? Heidi Heitkamp: Well, I think if you know Trump and I know Trump, we’ve spent a lot of time with him during the time that we were in the Senate, and he was the President. When things aren’t going well, he looks for someone to blame. And right now, he’s looking to blame his vice presidential candidate. And so, he’s spending way too much time talking about how that guy is the problem. He had a chance to pivot after the assassination attempt to a kinder, gentler, you know, “I’ve learned my lesson, don’t believe in political violence.” He went completely the other way. And so, is there a chance for him to pivot to a more normal tone in this campaign? And so far, he’s not only gone off the rails, so has his vice presidential candidate. And I think it’s an example, Claire, we always say this, that people think, “oh, that guy, he’s a senator, he’s ready for prime time.” He’s a senator for a hot minute, he’s never been in the spotlight, and he doesn’t think before he talks about, how is this going to be perceived by those all-important swing voters because he’s only spent his time talking to the radicals in his own party, genning them up and getting them engaged because that’s how you win primaries. And in red states, winning the primaries is everything, they don’t know how to talk to swing voters. And so, if I were in the room, I would show them data on what swing voters care about. I would say, “You need to be myopically focused on a policy message and not on grievance.” But I don’t think Trump is capable of walking away from grievance. That’s not Donald Trump. He’s right now looking for a scapegoat. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And by the way, I’m glad you’re not in the room with them because that’s way too good of advice. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Claire McCaskill: But the good news is, he would never take it, especially from a woman. So, although they’re saying they may bring back Kellyanne Conway, who knows? Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Claire McCaskill: By the way, he’s still playing golf almost every day, just so everybody knows. And that’s the other thing that’s really interesting here. The work ethic of the Harris-Walz campaign is going to start showing in ways that even swing voters and low-information voters and voters that don’t engage in the last 60 days are going to start noticing. You can’t do one campaign event a week when your opponent is doing seven or doing a bus tour, going to Pennsylvania all the way to the Chicago convention. These guys, Walz and Harris, are putting in 12-, 15-hour days every day, and besides that, you know, she’s happened to be Vice President, so she’s got work to do in that regard too. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, and think about this, because when people say, age doesn’t matter, this is exactly what we’re talking about. It’s a lot easier for people who are barely 60 to keep up that pace, to not make mental errors. And I think Donald Trump, I think that they’re afraid to send Donald Trump out on that kind of schedule because the more tired he gets, the more kind of grievance-driven he is. And so, Claire, if I’m in the room, I’m thinking, how do I balance the potential of him basically creating a two-day news cycle with some major gap compared to keeping him golfing. And I think that the real deal here is, had they picked maybe somebody else for vice president, they were expecting Trump to draft behind his vice presidential candidate, if you’re into biking, you know what I mean. Draft behind that vice presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate trips over their hurdles every step of the way, I mean, including this new thing with postmenopausal women, which we are, which by the way, why aren’t you taking care of your grandkids 24/7, Claire, and I have wondered, why aren’t I just go in there and taking care of my grandkids? We’re failing as grandmothers. Claire McCaskill: Yes, I noticed Hillary tweeted this morning something along the lines. First, it’s the child as cat ladies. Now, it’s postmenopausal women have no purpose in life other than raising grandchildren. Do these guys don’t realize that women have the vote? That’s my only question. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, and their swing voters, and their swing voters. Claire McCaskill: Oh, yes. Heidi Heitkamp: They have completely forgotten the game plan of six months ago. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And look at their three issues, Heidi. There are three issues. You know, first of all, if I were in the room with the Harris-Walz campaign, I would be continuing to try to drive crowd size because that’s his kryptonite. He cannot help himself on crowd size. So the more we have thousands and thousands of people turning out for her rallies, the better it is because it really bugs him. But there are three big issues, immigration, crime, and inflation. On all three of those, the Harris-Walz campaign can go on offense. They can go on offense on immigration because it’s way down. I mean, I read this morning, Abbott hasn’t even been able to send a bus to New York since last year. They are not seeing the border crossings that they saw earlier in the Biden administration, and they turned down a really effective border patrol-endorsed bill. Crime is down. The Justice Department chose a 15 percent drop in violent crime. More importantly, because they don’t believe the FBI or the Justice Department. The Major Cities Chiefs Association is showing that the murder rate in the 70 largest U.S. cities is down more than 8 percent since Trump left office. And then finally, inflation. I mean, we’re seeing inflation and the consumer price index, all of those things are moving the right direction. And even though it’s still too expensive to buy food and fuel, it is better than it was, and people are beginning to sense that. So there are three big issues. Harris and Walz have a lot of room to pivot and punch on their three issues. Heidi Heitkamp: And think about this, Claire, whenever they’re losing on the big issues, they pivot to cultural issues and that has historically been choice, and they are shocked. They are shocked that people are turning out to vote for a woman’s reproductive rights. They have played that issue in your state and my state for how many cycles and now, the worm has turned, and they have no ability to adapt. And I think it’s fascinating to watch them spin their tires. And, you know, we were talking about whether Kellyanne Conway is going to come back to the campaign. Guess what? She doesn’t have any magic answer to any of this either. She’s spinning on, “What do you do with this?” Claire McCaskill: Right. So, speaking of cultural issues, let’s segue to your area of expertise. The biggest divide in America, we talk about divides, partisan divides, but the biggest divide really in voter behavior at this point, especially over the last decade, is urban and rural. And you have spent a great deal of time trying to figure out why it is that rural voters are willing to vote against their own interests, economic interests at the altar of cultural issues. And I’d love you to spend a little time explaining how you think we can make progress with rural voters and whether or not you think Harris and Walz have a chance to make progress with rural voters in this election. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, first, let’s talk about that shift. I mean, when we talk about the ability to overcome a 22-point deficit. Barack Obama lost North Dakota by 22 points and now, he still won. Why is that? Because historically, the Republican Party hated the farm bill, and they would vote against it, and we could beat up on the farm bill. When they decided to embrace the farm bill, guess what? They started winning it because that economic issue now faded in comparison to the cultural issues of abortion or marriage equality, whatever it was, whatever was the dividing factor. So, now, we’ve got this mindset. Number one, I think we should be talking in the Democratic Party about how the Republicans have failed to deliver a farm bill, creating certainty, that they talk the talk, they never walk the walk. Democrats walk the walk, show the public what this administration has done for rural America, the kind of investment through the infrastructure bill, the commitment that we have, to doing a farm bill, the commitment we have to biofuels, which is huge in my part of the country, and we need to lead with that. But I think that one of the biggest reasons why we’ve lost rural America is because rural America doesn’t feel respected by Democrats. And I think if you watched any of the national news, you knew that I was out there, 190 percent for Tim Walz. And the reason why, not because I disliked or don’t appreciate, I don’t know Shapiro all that well, I certainly know Mark Kelly, love Mark Kelly, but I wanted someone that I could point to and say, “That guy who is us is going to be at the seat of power. He is going to be sitting in there talking about rural America every day.” And if you don’t think she respects rural America, why would she pick him? Claire McCaskill: Right. Heidi Heitkamp: She respects what we have to say. And so, I’ve said things like, “If you need your oil changed in your pickup, Tim Walz knows how to do that. If you need to go fishing, Tim Walz knows how to dock a boat then get you in the boat.” And so, I think that when you look at Tim Walz and you look at this ticket, we have a rural champion as her partner. And I think that’s a ticket we can sell. And the enthusiasm for Trump, I’m not saying they wouldn’t vote for him, but you are seeing a diminished enthusiasm for Donald Trump and rural America, and so I have reason for optimism, Claire. Claire McCaskill: I do too. And I do think what the president and vice president are doing today on healthcare costs, this negotiating for prescription drug costs, that’s going to save Medicare $6 billion next year and, you know, bring down the cost of some medicines as much as 79 percent for seniors. You and I both know that one of the crises of many crises in rural America, it’s healthcare. Heidi Heitkamp: Mm-hmm. Claire McCaskill: And the availability and the cost of healthcare is a big damn deal in rural America. And I do think they’re onto something here and they need to stay on it. Heidi Heitkamp: And if I can add, Claire, for all your listeners, understand this, every state that adopted Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has been able to save many more of their rural hospitals than states that haven’t. And so, I think it’s interesting that Trump’s not talking about repealing the ACA, Obamacare, because he knows it’s enormously popular in rural America where people can afford health insurance for the first time in a long time in their lives. Claire McCaskill: Yes, they’re not talking about healthcare at all. Well, we’re going to pause here. Up next, we’ve got Dave Wasserman of “Cook Political Report”. He joined us for a detailed view inside the latest polling and what down-ballot races look like after the shift to Vice President Harris. Back in a moment. Welcome back. My co-host, my buddy, my friend, Senator Heidi Heitkamp is still with me. And as we inch closer to November and the pivot to a Harris-Walz ticket, which has been amazing, we want to get a sense of what the polling is showing at this moment and how the new Democratic candidates have affected the down-ballot races. We’ve spent a lot of time talking about Harris-Walz in the last two weeks, not as much time talking about the House and the Senate. So, we’re going to try to cover that ground too. No one is better to do that with than Dave Wasserman. He is the Senior Editor and Elections Analyst for “The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter”, recognized as one of the nation’s top election forecasters. Dave leads the development of key election data visualizations and manages coverage of the House and redistricting developments. Welcome, Dave. Dave Wasserman: Hey, thanks so much. And might I add? It’s quite an honor to be with two of the winners of what we would consider to be the all-time greatest Senate races of the last century. Claire McCaskill: ’06. Heidi Heitkamp: Wow, wow. Claire McCaskill: It was quite a year. Heidi Heitkamp: Mine was ’12. Claire McCaskill: ’12.. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Claire McCaskill: Yours was ’12. Well, yes, and then that was kind of a special one for me. I was up to no good that it worked. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Dave Wasserman: Yes. You know, one of the projects we undertook this past year, “The Cook Report”, was digitizing all our archives going back 40 years to 1984. There are some great Senate race stories in there, but it’s hard to peg stronger overperformances in the modern era than what you, guys, posted, so hat’s off. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Heidi kicked ass too. It was great fun. Okay, this week, “The Cook Political Report” relaunched their national polling average now reflecting of the general election matchup between Harris and Trump. Before we get into where the horse race is right now based on polling, let’s take a second to try to consume what is important for our listeners to understand. We’re going to eat our veggies and talk about the margin of error. What is the margin of error? How does it work? And I think we have to keep reminding everyone that just because somebody’s up by four doesn’t mean they’re really up by four based on the margin of error. Dave Wasserman: Sure. Well, statistically, margin of error is the plus or minus that you have confidence a poll is accurate within a 95 percent confidence interval. What people have to understand is that even if Kamala Harris has a one- or two-point lead, that is within the margin of error given that the sample size produces a margin of error of around plus or minus four. But I think just as important as MOE is understanding that response rates have fallen through the floor. And so, polling is in the midst of a big question mark where people are just not answering the phone, and we haven’t yet fully moved on from traditional telephone-only polling even with large cell phone components, but we haven’t perfected the science of fully online polling either. We’re confident that these swing state polls that we put in the field do the best job we can of measuring what’s going on in the seven battleground states. We partnered with a Democratic firm, BSG, and a Republican firm, GS Strategy Group. And the difference between the polls that we put into the field in May and those that we just came out with is really with low engagement voters. Back in May, we were looking at Joe Biden ahead by four points, 49-45 among voters who were four out of four participating in the most recent four federal elections so voters who had shown up in ‘16, ‘18, ‘20 and ‘22. But he was trailing Trump by 10 points among everyone else, 41-51. And now, we’re seeing Kamala Harris, she has the same four-point lead among the high engagement voters, those who are paying the most attention and are most civicminded, 50 percent to 46 percent, but she’s narrowed the gap among the lower engagement, half of the electorate, to just three points. Trump has a 48- to 45-point lead in those seven battleground states. And what that tells me is that Kamala Harris is simply a much better pop culture candidate than Joe Biden. She has broken through on social media and channels like TikTok in a way that Joe Biden simply could not. And as a result, we’ve seen a collapse among RFK and third-party candidates, a shift in undecided and third parties to Kamala Harris’s column whereas Donald Trump’s number has pretty much remained the same. Claire McCaskill: So, I have a question. When people talk about polling and they think about predictability, one of the concerns that I have is that when you say, Trump’s ahead four, and then on election day, because he hasn’t enthusiastically built his base, he says, it’s rigged. And one of the problems that we have with polling is that it creates expectation. And now, we have, you know, the challenges of, this can’t be true, the election was rigged. How do we fix that, Dave? Dave Wasserman: You know, I think one of the hardest parts of building confidence in elections is the fact that it does take a long time to count the votes in these pivotal states when there aren’t laws passed that allow for pre-canvassing. And in 2020, it was, by design, a Trump and Republicans in key legislatures, including in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, to not adopt the same rules that states like Florida and Texas have that allow election officials to tally their ballots in advance of election day, so they’re ready to report at 7:00 or 8:00 P.M. when the poll is closed. People don’t understand why it takes so long to get election results, why it takes days, and it opens the door for bad actors to cast dispersions on election administration and to insinuate that something nefarious is going on. And we just saw in Pennsylvania that once again, the legislature in that state has blocked an effort to allow for pre-canvassing ballots. So, I think that’s another way in which Trump has laid the groundwork to question election results if Democrats win narrowly or even a little bit more than narrowly. Claire McCaskill: So what is the bottom-line at this point? Is she ahead in the battleground states and nationally? And if so, should we accurately call this a really, really close election at this point? Dave Wasserman: Look, for the first half of the year, things were so static that it almost felt like something seismic was bound to happen. And we’ve had about a year’s worth of seismic activity in just the last 40 days alone. We went from a campaign that Republicans would say, felt like “Weekend at Bernie’s” to “Silence of the Lambs” if you’re putting this in Netflix terminology to “Catwoman” featuring J.D. Vance to then “White Men Can’t Jump” featuring the roster of Democrats Kamala Harris was considering for V.P. And I don’t want to say we’re at “Miss Congeniality”, but we’re seeing the most remarkable turnaround in a candidate’s image in quite some time. Kamala Harris was at, in the FiveThirtyEight average, 37 fav, 53 unfav on July 20th. Today, she’s at 44 to 48, which qualifies as almost deity status given how anti-partisan, you know, skeptical of both parties’ nominees’ voters have generally been all year. Now, Trump has also seen a slight bump in favorability from 42-54 to 43-52, but Democrats need to be aware because this does not mean, given the polling, you know, that we’re seeing in these battleground states, which now might show Kamala Harris ahead very, very narrowly. This does not mean that Kamala Harris is suddenly the favorite in this race. Keep in mind that in 2020, Joe Biden led Donald Trump by an average of seven or eight points nationally heading into election day. And he had clear leads in all of the key battleground states and yet he won the national popular vote by four and a half points and the tipping-point state in the Electoral College, Wisconsin, by just 0.7. And if you add up Biden’s cumulative margin of victory in the three closest states, Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, he effectively won the election by 42,918 votes out of 159.6 million votes cast nationwide. And so, even while Trump was at a 41 percent approval rating, he was the incumbent, the spotlight was on him, he came within 43,000 votes of winning a second term. And it’s hard to imagine a better news environment for Kamala Harris than the one we’ve seen the past few weeks. Not only has she been able to reframe the race and reintroduce herself to voters in a way that makes her seem like the candidate of change rather than the vice president or incumbent administration. Obviously, Donald Trump has been rattled, he’s flailing, whether it is, you know, questioning her ethnicity or bashing Brian Kemp. These are politically insane things that he’s engaged in which, you know, by his standards, is reminiscent of elements of ‘16 and ‘20 but is certainly a change in tone from what we saw for the first half of the year when he was the favor. Heidi Heitkamp: So, let’s turn to what Claire and I think about quite a bit, which is, what’s going to happen with our former colleagues and maybe some new colleagues. Given this change, any chance for any new pickups for the Democratic Party and how are some of our incumbents doing like Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown? Dave Wasserman: Yes. And look, the down-ballot picture has not changed as drastically or nearly at all compared to what we’re seeing at the top of the ticket. And it’s amazing, you know, at the top of the ticket, what a difference it makes for Democrats when there are no longer questions about their nominees’ age. And I think, you know, we’re seeing Kamala Harris perform much more like a generic Democrat in this race against Trump. And the good news for Democrats, down-ballot is that we’re likely to see a much more conventional turnout on that side among young voters and among minority voters. We’re seeing better numbers obviously for Kamala Harris among Black and Hispanic voters. I would note, by the way, that in these polls, she’s making progress with those based Democratic groups, but she’s still not back to where Biden and Harris were in the final polls in 2020. And that is, you know, a reason for Democrats not to be overconfident right now in addition to the fact that in our poll, 53 percent said that she’s too liberal to govern the country effectively. And I think, you know, to sustain this momentum, she’ll need to be able to seize the middle. But how does this impact the Senate races? Well, for people like Jacky Rosen and Bob Casey and Tammy Baldwin, they were already running substantially ahead of Joe Biden. And in our most recent battleground state polls, there’s good news for Senate Democrats. Ruben Gallego, nine points ahead of Kari Lake in Arizona. We had Bob Casey running 13 points ahead of Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin by seven over Eric Hovde in Wisconsin. The real eyepopper was Jacky Rosen with a 54 to 36 lead in Nevada. Claire McCaskill: Wow. Dave Wasserman: Even though Harris is down three of the state now, of course, that is an outlier. And there are far more polls that show a closer race than that for Nevada Senate, but still, Jacky Rosen has had a massive spending advantage in the last couple months outspending Sam Brown, the Republican, something like 14 million to 1.7 million, and bashing him on abortion. The real problem for Democrats in the Senate is in these red states of Montana and Ohio. And the one place where I don’t think the switch at the top of the ticket is helpful for Democrats is Montana because, you know, a surge nationally in Black and Hispanic turnout really doesn’t show up in a state as white as Montana but also, Tester has realized that it’s probably unwise to endorse Kamala Harris given her liberal image, her California image in a state that is likely to vote for Trump by close to 20 points. And I think we are beginning to see some separation of that race from the others where Tim Sheehy appears to be opening up a slight lead. Now, I think Sherrod Brown is still very, very much in the fight. Claire McCaskill: He’s hanging in there. Dave Wasserman: Yes. And ahead -- Claire McCaskill: Yes. Dave Wasserman: -- in most surveys narrowly, not at 50 percent, but the math in Ohio is a bit different. You know, an increase in nonwhite turnout is going to benefit Sherrod Brown there. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Dave Wasserman: And also, Bernie Moreno had to get through a really competitive Republican primary where he had to take stances to the right on abortion that are out of step with where the majority of Ohio voters are. Claire McCaskill: Right. And just briefly, Dave, are Democrats engaging in the dream that we have every once in a while, that we could actually beat Ted Cruz and Rick Scott? Is there any chance in Texas or Florida? It feels like there is to me, especially with abortion on the ballot in Florida and how bad Texas has been on the subject of abortion, but what do you think? Any chance? Tell me there’s a chance, tell me there’s a chance. Dave Wasserman: You know, we don’t have a lot of great data from Florida and Texas in the past few weeks, but it’s hard to imagine these states being winnable for Senate Democrats if there’s no national investment in the presidential race in these states. And in Florida, you know, you look at the trendline here, it’s a state where Trump expanded his margin between 2016 and 2020. And obviously, Ron DeSantis blew the doors off in 2022 when Democrats just stopped believing they could win. And I think that has corrosive effects when it comes to the Democratic base in the state, not only are you seeing states kind of attract likeminded people based on the governance and abortion policies quite frankly of the states, which I think is causing fewer democratic voters to move into Florida, probably prompting some to move out of Florida, but also that lack of belief and lack of money into Florida and Texas makes it very hard for Collin Allred and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell even if those Republican incumbents have unique liability. So they’re still in our likely Republican column. Claire McCaskill: Well, I’m going to just tell everybody right now, I believe it can happen. Next up, how the map is looking for the control of the House, this is where Dave’s a real expert back with Senator Heidi Heitkamp and Dave Wasserman of “Cook Political Report” in a moment. Welcome back. Former North Dakota Senator extraordinaire Heidi Heitkamp, and I have been speaking with Dave Wasserman, Senior Editor and Elections Analyst for “The Cook Political Report”. Dave and Heidi, let’s head to the House. What’s it look like over there, Dave? We all thought that it was a sure thing. We’d have a House pickup of a majority for Democrats before the wheels fell off the Biden campaign and then we all got very nervous. Chief worry among those were Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi. Should they feel a little more comfortable now? Dave Wasserman: You know, I don’t think that the House picture has changed all that much from where it was in, say, May. Now, had Joe Biden remained the Democratic nominee and there was a fatalism that set in among Democrats then I think you would’ve had a problem that really hurt Democrat’s ability to win the House. But the dynamic in the House has been a little bit more favorable to Democrats than in the Senate, actually, a lot more favorable than the Senate for a couple of reasons. Number one, they’re fighting on more favorable terrain than in the Senate. You’re not talking about defending Montana and Ohio as much because there are 16 Republicans sitting in Biden districts up for re-election and five Democrats sitting in Trump districts, and Democrats only need to pick up four seats on that to get to 218. And most of those vulnerable Republicans are in California and New York. And most of those Democrats in Trump districts are pretty strong incumbents, people like Jared Golden and Mary Peltola and Marcy Kaptur. And then the second reason is you have seen, and I think this is validated by the Senate battleground polls that we just came out of field with. Voters, to the extent they believe Donald Trump has a good chance of winning the White House, they want to put a check on him. And Democrats have benefited from the desire of voters to vote for a Democrat to prevent Trump from going too far in his direction. We saw, I think, the opposite dynamic in ‘16 and ‘20, when the polls showed that Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden were going to win by a mile. And you had a number of suburban independence, particularly women who decided, well, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden’s going to win, you know, I’m not voting for Donald Trump, but I’m going to vote for a more conventional Republican down-ballot who is not Donald Trump, who will prevent Democrats from going too far and left. And I think we’re seeing that dynamic show up in House polls where, you know, Democratic incumbents in particular have been running ahead of Joe Biden all year long. Now, they’re still running ahead of the top of the ticket, but Kamala Harris has come closer in many districts to where those House Democrats already work. And then the third part is that House Republicans have been a mess. It took them 15 votes to elect a speaker. It took only eight House Republicans to oust that speaker last October. And Democrats picked up George Santos’s seat in New York, and now, they are within four seats, and they have a financial advantage in most of these toss-up contests. The reason I still think it’s going to be tough for Democrats to get over the top in the House is some of these open seats. Republicans don’t really have any vulnerable open seats. Democrats have two toss-up open seats in Michigan where Dan Kildee is retiring and where Elissa Slotkin is running for Senate. And then also in Virginia and California, there are a few that Democrats need to defend. So, the House is going to be really close. Heidi Heitkamp: I want to make this point, Dave, because I think when you look at 2020, because of COVID, Democrats didn’t run a very aggressive field game. And I think that’s why you saw the polling not match the outcome in a lot of the swing states. Now, there’s been huge amounts of investment in field, especially in those swing states when we talk about Michigan. So how does the Democrat turnout machine that I think will get cranked up after the convention, how will that affect these House races? Dave Wasserman: Well, it’s a good question, particularly in those states where you have overlap. So, you know, there are two toss-ups each in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona. And, you know, those seats are going to depend a lot on the party’s ground games. And the Republicans have taken a big risk by outsourcing Trump’s ground effort to super PACS, including Turning Point USA, whereas Democrats have a well-funded and more conventional coordinated campaign to knock on doors in most of these places. And that stands to benefit Democrats running in these close seats. But keep in mind that most of these toss-up races are going to be in California and New York. And we have 22 toss-ups out of 435 seats. If you add up all the seats that at least lean towards Democrats, there are 203 seats in our ratings. If you add up all the seats that at least lean towards Republicans, there are 210. These 22 toss-ups will come down to people like Mike Garcia, a Republican in Northern L.A. County, or Mike Lawler, a Republican in Westchester County, outside of New York. And they are talented Republicans who are fending off well-funded Democratic challengers. And, you know, one thing we noticed is that incumbents on both sides of the aisle are doing quite well, but Democrats only need to knock off a handful of Republicans to get to 218. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And I think it’s important on this ground game. We’ve tried to cover this in previous episodes. You know, the ground game is really where campaigns identify voters that are low frequency, that are not as engaged as your likely voters, your four-out-of- fours that you referred to earlier, Dave, and they find these folks and then they actually have to do this a lot with volunteers, a lot with volunteers. You cannot pay enough people to knock on the doors, identify the voter and then do the follow-up you have to do to push them towards the polls. And the interesting thing is they basically shut down their ground operation when Lara Trump took over the RNC when she and Sevidas moved in there. And they put all those resources into this bullshit voter intimidation, voter suppression, let’s see if we can’t figure out a way to not certify elections. They put all the resources there and then outsourced the traditional stuff. Now, I don’t know, but I don’t know very many volunteers that show up for a bunch of paid people with some organization they’ve never heard from, they don’t know about. I can’t envision how these paid PACs, how these super PACs are going to get the bodies on the ground that you need to do this effectively. I know how many we had to have in ‘18. We knocked on more doors than any other Senate campaign in the country. We had thousands of volunteers. And I can’t imagine they’re getting that many volunteers for their ground game. Heidi Heitkamp: So, Claire, let’s add to that, since Kamala has joined the race, the amount of volunteers has exploded. So, we know that that’s happening, more people wanting to be engaged. Plus, I want to tell a story about Iowa because I think it illustrates what you’re talking about. When I was in Iowa during the Republican caucuses, I heard story after story because Nikki Haley outsourced her ground game to the Koch operation, right? And there were people going door-to-door for Nikki Haley that when they were challenged at the door, “I’m voting for Trump,” the people at the door said, “So am I, I’m just getting paid to knock this door.” And so, here is exactly the example. When you don’t have believers knocking the door, you have paid people just knocking the door, that’s not a formula for success. You need true believers who are going to be respectful but also tell the story. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And before we leave, Dave, I want to make sure we get in a couple of minutes on the governor’s races because we’ve now done presidential, we’ve done the Senate, we’ve done the House. Tell me what you’re seeing in the governor’s races. Any chances for pickups for the Democrats in the governor’s races? Dave Wasserman: Well, the only real chance for a pickup would be New Hampshire. And keep in mind, there are only 10 governor’s races on the ballot this year. Now, Democrats are in a decent position to hold on to North Carolina because, keep in mind, Roy Cooper is leaving, Josh Stein has opened up a lead, according to our latest poll against Mark Robinson, who has -- Claire McCaskill: Is a nut. Dave Wasserman: -- said a variety of things that, you know, Democrats can frame as, you know, kind of being from another planet with regard to his views on women and abortion. And so, Josh Stein has basically just flooded the airwaves with Mark Robinson in his own words. And that has transferred this race from basically a tie back in May to, in our latest poll, 48-40 lead for Stein. So, you know, that seat looks better for Democrats than it did. But most of the governor’s races we’re watching are in safe state. Now, I’ll be very curious to see what these longshot Democrats are able to put together in Indiana and Missouri, two states where you have had some Republican infighting that, you know, could at least make those contests more interesting. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And we have abortion on the ballot too in Missouri. I’m not giving up on Crystal Quade, who is the Democratic nominee for governor, and I’m certainly not giving up on Lucas Kunce, who is running against a guy that I think people know by the name of Josh Hawley, the He-Man, the manly man, the guy who has the nerve to write a book about manhood when he ran through the hallways of the Capitol, like a scared little puppy, when the folks invaded. Can you tell I really like this guy? I try not to trash him too often because it’s not good for my mental health, but you know. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Well, I call him the hand razor. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Heidi Heitkamp: You know, yay insurrection, the yay insurrection guy. And so, I think, you know, even though abortion’s not on the ballot in North Carolina, it’s on the ballot in North Carolina because of their gubernatorial candidate. And I think for your listeners, Claire, it’s really important that you understand that these races are not separable in terms of turnout. You could have somebody who turned out for the governor. We haven’t seen split ticket voting in a long, long time, certainly as it relates to the president and the Senate. What I’m watching is, are we going to see again split ticket voting come back to the American population, American democracy, which I think would be a good thing? That’s me from a red state. As a Democrat, I always relied on split ticket voting. It went away for at least the last 10 years. It might be coming back this cycle. Claire McCaskill: The only place that we really saw a significant split ticket in voting in the last Senate cycle was, in fact, Montana and Ohio and West Virginia. Dave Wasserman: Right. And we are seeing a comeback in split ticket voting in some of the Senate polls this cycle, and that’s really a testament to, I think, how much voters were down on Biden for most of the cycle, but we’re not ready to embrace Republicans and wanted balance. And I think we’re still seeing that to some extent, the question is whether Democrats can sustain it all the way to November. Claire McCaskill: All right. Well, this has been great. Really appreciate you, Dave. Thank you for your time. Thank you for educating us about the polling and all of these places. And we’ll look forward to checking in with you because, who knows? This has been quite a rollercoaster ride. I’m not sure we’ve seen the last incline or the last dip. There may be others in the future. There usually is in October. We’ll see how the debates turn out. But it’s been great to have you, we really appreciate you. Dave Wasserman: Thanks for having me. Claire McCaskill: Thanks for joining us for today’s installment of “How to Win 2024” and a huge thanks. I hope you can feel it in my voice how much I love this woman. I can get choked up, I love her so much. A big thank you to the best thing to ever come out of North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, listen to one of my favorite postmenopausal grandmas in the whole wide world. I love you to death and I love your whole family. You know, Claire, it’s always so much fun when you and I are together. Claire McCaskill: Yes, let’s do it again. Heidi Heitkamp: Absolutely.

Trump taps two of his adult kids for presidential transition team,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 6:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-two-adult-kids-presidential-transition-team-rcna167129,"When Donald Trump was president, he relied on his daughter and son-in-law in the West Wing. When Trump needed a new leadership team at the Republican National Committee, he rewarded his daughter-in-law with a top post. And when it came time for Trump to put together a post-election transition team, the former president once again kept matters within the family. The New Republic noted that the GOP candidate unveiled a five-member transition team — and two of his sons are on it. It’s worth emphasizing that in modern presidential elections, both major-party nominees choose transition teams long before Election Day so that they don’t have to start from scratch in November. This isn’t a situation in which members of Team Trump are simply assuming they’re going to win; Team Harris is making similar plans. Indeed, part of what makes these developments notable isn’t that they’re too early, but rather, that they’re surprisingly late. As a New York Times report explained, “As a matter of timing, it came months after a typical presidential campaign starts working on contingency planning to ensure a smooth transition should its candidate win the election.” In 2016, for example, Trump’s operation announced a transition team in May. This year, for reasons unknown, the Republican campaign waited until mid-August. What’s more, eight years ago, Team Trump focused on officials with governing experience to oversee the transition effort, tapping then-Gov. Chris Christie and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. In 2024, the transition team will feature McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive who led the Small Business Administration during Trump’s term; Lutnick, a wealthy donor; two of Trump’s sons; and the former president’s current running mate. But just as notable is the fact that the transition team is slated to play a prominent role in staffing the prospective administration, and as The New Republic’s report added, this is a subject of great interest to the former president’s oldest son. “I don’t want to pick a single person for a position of power. All I want to do is block the guys that would be a disaster,” Trump Jr. told Axios in July. “I want to block the liars. I want to block the guys that are, you know, pretending they’re with you.” The Times’ report added that Team Trump does not intend to use “the office space and computers that the federal government makes available for transitions,” and officials from the campaign would not explain why."
Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat's Olympic medal bid is rejected,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 6:25 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 19, 2024, 6:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/india-wrestler-vinesh-phogat-medal-rejected-rcna166708,"UPDATE (Aug. 19, 2024, 9:21 a.m. ET): The Court of Arbitration for Sport has now published its decision explaining the denial of Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat’s application for a shared silver medal after she did not make the required weight ahead of the finals. The arbitrator’s decision cited the strict weight rules for Olympic competition. Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat’s legal bid for an Olympic silver medal has been rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The star athlete, known for her activism against sexual harassment, was set to compete for a gold medal last week, but she was disqualified after she weighed in at just over the required 50-kilogram limit ahead of that match.   The court’s media release announcing the dismissal of Phogat’s application didn’t explain its reasoning, saying that the decision would be forthcoming on the Switzerland-based tribunal’s website.  But the outcome is unsurprising because, as I previously noted, the wrestling rules state that if an athlete doesn’t attend or fails a weigh-in, then they’re eliminated from the competition “and ranked last, without rank.” Nonetheless, Phogat applied to the tribunal for a (shared) silver medal. There are separate weigh-ins for each day of competition, so Phogat had made the weight cut-off in her previous matches leading up to the finals. She reportedly only missed the weight last Wednesday by 100 grams — about a fifth of a pound. She had been set to go for gold against U.S. wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt, who won the final match over Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Phogat beat in the semifinal the day before and who took Phogat’s place against Hildebrandt.

VFW slams Trump’s ‘asinine’ rhetoric about the Medal of Honor,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 5:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vfw-slams-trumps-asinine-rhetoric-medal-honor-rcna167119,"The Veterans of Foreign Wars has long positioned itself as a nonpartisan organization that has nothing to do with electoral politics. Plenty of groups run campaign ads, issue endorsements, and create super PACs, but the VFW isn’t one of them. With this in mind, it becomes all the more notable when the organization publicly criticizes a presidential candidate in an election year. In 2020, for example, an Iranian missile strike left several dozen U.S. troops with traumatic brain injuries. Trump dismissed the importance of the injuries — he called them little more than “headaches” — prompting the Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask him to apologize for minimizing what had happened to the troops. Trump ignored the request. Four years later, the GOP candidate insulted veterans again, prompting another VFW response. The New York Times reported: If you missed it, it was late last week when Trump spoke at an event on antisemitism at his Bedminster golf club and was introduced by Miriam Adelson, who plays a prominent role in GOP politics. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, the former president, unprompted, reflected on the fact that he gave Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, as part of an apparent gesture to thank the late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “That’s the highest award you can get as a civilian. It’s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version,” Trump said, referring to the Medal of Honor military award. “It’s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump added. “She gets it and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal, but she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she got it for — and that’s through committees and everything else.” These unscripted and wildly unnecessary comments are what prompted the angry response from the VFW, among many others. For his part, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley responded to the controversy by telling NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt, “Well, look, there is nobody who supports the military, our veterans’ communities, and all of the military families more than President Trump.” I won’t pretend to know whether the RNC chair genuinely believes what he said, but the fact of the matter is that pretty much everyone supports the military, our veterans’ communities, and all of the military families more than Trump. We are, after all, talking about a Republican who has disparaged wounded veterans, condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers” and “losers,” disparaged American servicemen and women who are captured during combat, feuded with Gold Star families, and downplayed the importance of troops with traumatic brain injuries. What’s more, as a candidate, Trump liked to say he “felt” like he had served in the military because his parents sent him to a military-themed boarding school as a teenager. He went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military,” which was a precursor to Trump pointing to bone spurs as part of an apparent effort to dodge the draft. In other words, it’s not as if this guy has a reservoir of credibility on veterans’ issues he can rely on after his latest nonsensical comments."
Latest 2024 polls lead Trump campaign to concoct weird theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/latest-2024-polls-lead-trump-campaign-concoct-weird-theories-rcna167113,"For much of the year, Donald Trump had reason to be pleased with national and battleground state polling. Four years ago, surveys showed the Republican struggling badly ahead of his eventual defeat. In 2024, however, the data showed the former president consistently ahead. That is, until it didn’t. After incumbent President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign and Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy gave Democrats a much-needed boost, public opinion research showed Trump’s advantage start to evaporate — both in head-to-head matchups and on key issues. The GOP candidate and his political operation haven’t exactly handled the shift in a healthy way. Two weeks ago, for example, Team Trump embraced a “skewed polls” message reminiscent of 2012. On his social media platform, the former president also tweaked his messaging, abandoning missives about polls, and instead touting what he described as “real” polls that told him what he wanted to hear. But it was his running mate, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who took matters in a deeply weird direction. HuffPost reported: “Consistently, what you’ve seen in 2016 and 2020 is that the media uses fake polls to drive down Republican turnout and to create dissension and conflict with Republican voters,” the senator said. Vance added, “If you talk to insiders in the Kamala Harris campaign, they are very worried about where they are.” For now, let’s not dwell on the dubious idea that Trump’s running mate has special insights into the perspectives of Harris campaign staffers — who probably aren’t sharing private thoughts with the far-right senator. Let’s instead consider just how bizarre Vance’s conspiracy theory is. To hear Vance tell it, major independent news organizations conspired — more than once — to release false polling data, as part of an elaborate plot to discourage Republican voters. As far as the Ohioan is concerned, this is grounds for skepticism about 2024 polling. In Grown-Up Land, of course, major independent news organizations have never conspired to distribute fraudulent survey data, and the fact that Vance peddled such a line to a national television audience is a reminder of just how ridiculous his messaging has become. I did, however, have a follow-up question for the senator: If media outlets release “fake” polling data to manipulate Republican voters, why did the polls show Trump ahead for months? From Vance’s perspective, did news organizations temporarily forget, only to suddenly remember the plot?"
Democrats are united and focused — for a change,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-united-dnc-election-new-energy-harris-walz-rcna166638,"A month ago, Democrats weren’t just “in disarray,” as the perennial meme beloved by conservatives goes. They were in downright despair.  President Joe Biden was insisting he would stay on the presidential ticket unless the Almighty himself told him to step down. Since the Almighty had not made many direct interventions in human affairs since that one chat with Moses on Mount Sinai a few years back, it seemed like the Democrats were stuck with a candidate most Americans thought was too old to run again. Then came the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, from which he emerged with his fist held high in the air, surrounded by Secret Service agents as blood streamed from his ear. That image became instantly iconic, a show of defiance against a would-be assassin. A columnist for The Guardian had the temerity to put into words what many of us were thinking: “Did Donald Trump just win the election?” Yes, went the prevailing answer. In the days after the attempt on Trump’s life, in texts exchanged with Democratic operatives on Capitol Hill and staffers in the Biden administration, I sensed only unmitigated despair. Everyone was glad that Trump had emerged unscathed, but they also recognized how much that one moment had seemingly shifted the entire political landscape. “The presidential contest ended last night,” a Democratic strategist told NBC News. Morale was plunging. Not just electoral morale, mind you, but the morale of people who feared that their work — on green energy, racial equity, Israel-Palestine — was going to be undone by Trump, just as much of Barack Obama’s legacy had partly been after the 2016 election. The shock of a Trump victory in 2016 had come at the very last moment, as the stunning results from Wisconsin and Michigan came in. But as Democrats realized the ship was sinking in July 2024, many became resigned to watching a three-month slow-moving defeat — as Trump coasted to perhaps the easiest presidential victory since Ronald Reagan clobbered Walter Mondale in 1984. Now it is August, the Democratic National Convention is about to commence in Chicago, and the reversal of fortunes since late July could not be more astonishing. As a dispassionate observer who does not vote, I’ve nevertheless watched every Democrat I know wake up as if from a long, frustrating sleep into a sunny reality they did not know could exist. Not since the earliest days of the Obama phenomenon has there been this much energy from mainstream Democrats. We have much to learn about Vice President Kamala Harris, but there is no doubt she has energized the entire party in just a matter of weeks, despite having been a known and not especially well-liked political entity for the last four years. It’s like she fell out of a coconut tree, you might say, to suddenly discover that she has been unburdened by what has been (I’ll stop now). “She’s got an intensity advantage, and I haven’t seen anything like this happen in 30 days in my lifetime,” the Republican pollster Frank Luntz recently said on CNBC. That intensity took a few steps to build. First came the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, and the selection of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as Trump’s running mate. I maintained from the start that he was a bad choice born of arrogance, pushed by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, fringe nationalists and online edgelords (in other words, Peter Thiel). Everything since then has borne out that opinion, and then some. Vance is a serious drag on the Republican ticket. Don’t be surprised if Trump replaces Vance with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whom he should have picked in the first place. Then, of course, came The Swap. Here, I made an incorrect prediction: that Harris would not be seen as a legitimate choice to replace Biden unless she emerged from something resembling a primary. I was wrong. With astonishing speed, Harris got the entire Democratic establishment to back her as Biden’s successor. Third, there was Tim Walz. I found the far-left campaign against Josh Shapiro, the popular and moderate Pennsylvania governor, to be unseemly and frankly laced with antisemitism. At the same time, I am sure that his Minnesota counterpart is the better choice for this moment. Walz offers a better contrast to Harris herself, and his folksy Midwestern charm has been a tonic for our bitter political climate. Plus, his labeling Trump and, in particular, Vance as “weird” in an MSNBC interview may turn out to be the most inspired political branding of the season. He has only extended the enthusiasm for Harris while Vance has continued to drag on Trump. And then there’s Trump himself, who has struggled to define his new opponent while resorting to some of his worst impulses, attacking her racial identity at a summit of Black journalists, then going after Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, the Republican leader of a key state. “Trump Is Looking Like a Loser Again,” went the headline of a column by Gerard Baker of The Wall Street Journal, a conservative who likes Harris as much as I like the Boston Red Sox. In no way would I count out Trump — but it’s simply undeniable that his chances of victory are trending downward. He is doing nothing to help his own chances. And expect to see protests by activists in Chicago. Although some pro-Palestinian activists have said they are willing to give Harris a chance, she is unlikely to budge from her commitment to Israel, which could lead to a damaging internecine spat. Her centrist views on the economy could also frustrate a left that, like the right, is bound to be disappointed by the fact that Harris is not a to-the-barricades progressive. Please don’t read any of this as cheerleading. It is simply true that the Democrats have enjoyed a reversal of fortunes unlike anything I’ve seen in American politics. It may not last, but it is real."
Why Beyoncé's 'Freedom' is the perfect campaign song for Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/beyonce-kamala-harris-freedom-rcna166745,"In the voice-over for Vice President Kamala Harris’ first campaign ad as a 2024 presidential candidate, we heard her lay out her objectives for America — ­ranging from reducing gun violence, poverty and health care costs to codifying reproductive rights — and we see a racially diverse mix of enthusiastic voters, multigenerational families, union workers, the LGBTQ+ community, Harris on the campaign trail and headlines about Donald Trump’s conviction in Manhattan. We also heard a familiar song playing. That song is Beyoncé’s 2016 anthem “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar, which Beyoncé permitted Harris to use as her walk-out song during her first public appearance as a presidential candidate. It’s also the official campaign (and theme) song of Harris’ 2024 presidential bid. With its liberating tone, the song, which was used as a battle cry for many Black Lives Matter demonstrations following the 2020 death of George Floyd, now evokes the aspirational promise of the Democratic Party. Alongside the pounding, warlike drums and fiery rock pulse, Beyoncé’s voice roars, “I’ma keep running ’cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.”Great campaign songs often toe a fine line between galvanizing a political party’s base and aligning with its supporters’ interests and pressing concerns. Great campaign songs are also effective at capturing the vision and policies of the presidential candidates. No one should be surprised that Beyoncé let Harris use “Freedom.” From day one, she has been intentional about using her artistry to advocate for women’s empowerment, sisterhood, community, Black culture and freedom. As a member of Destiny’s Child, her quicksilver and resolute vocals adorned such chart-toppers as “Bills, Bills, Bills,” “Independent Women, Pt. 1” and “Survivor,” articulating the ideals of modern Black women through an infectious, contemporary mix of R&B, pop and hip-hop grooves.On introspective, experimental full-length albums such as 2013’s world-stopping “Beyoncé,” 2016’s culture-defining song cycle “Lemonade,” and her celebratory 2022 love letter to LGBTQ+ culture’s roots in dance music, “Renaissance,” Beyoncé refined her sound and messages to reflect the social zeitgeist as well as her evolution as a woman and cultural observer. Using “Freedom” to amp up excitement for campaign is a sign that Harris understands Beyoncé’s influence on the culture and that her campaign recognizes Beyoncé as a generational icon with a wide appeal among younger demographics. Harris has long devoted her time to addressing the issues facing younger generations, especially younger women. From implementing solutions to help millions curb their crippling student loan debt to stressing the importance of upholding the protections of Roe v. Wade, she is campaigning on a promise to defend the interests and protect the rights and well-being of young people. She has to know what’s at stake if young people aren’t motivated to vote.According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the turnout of young voters ages 18 to 29 saw a significant boost in the 2020 election, rising almost 12 percentage points from 2016. In 2020, 55% of registered voters in this age group cast their ballots, marking the largest turnout in this demographic since 1972. Even so, the fact remains that older voters turn out at the highest rates. In the 2020 election, 74% of voters ages 65 and older participated. There’s been an ongoing debate over whether Harris can effectively win over Gen-Z and younger millennial voters. Megan Thee Stallion performed at her large rally in Atlanta, and celebrities including Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Olivia Rodrigo, Barbra Streisand and Lizzo have expressed support for either Harris or her policies. Some have argued that this embrace of memes, celebrity endorsements and Gen-Z jargon is not enough. By itself, it isn’t. At least it shouldn’t be. Harris still needs to earn the votes of this country’s youngest voters. But she can’t do that without grabbing their attention, and relying on celebrities who support her is not a bad way of doing that.Harris is also fortunate to be the kind candidate and to have the kind of platform that the world’s best musicians want to be associated with. Add to that many artists’ distaste for her opponent. A long list of musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Adele have objected to Trump using their work to promote his campaign. When the former president’s campaign played a video of Celine Dion performing “My Heart Will Go On” at a rally in Montana this month, her team responded, “In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use… And really, THAT song?” Last week, Isaac Hayes Enterprises (the estate of the late musician) announced that it is suing Trump and his campaign for “134 counts [of] copyright infringement for the unauthorized use of the song ‘Hold On I’m Coming’ at campaign rallies from 2022-2024.” Hayes co-wrote the song, which was most famously performed by Sam & Dave.(The Associated Press reports that in 2022, David Porter, another co-writer, wrote “Hell to the NO!” after learning that Trump had used “Hold On, I’m Coming” at an NRA rally. Sam Moore (one half of Sam & Dave) performed “America the Beautiful” at a pre-inauguration concert Trump held in 2017.) But Beyoncé has given Harris the freedom to use one of her most powerful songs. “Freedom, freedom, where are you? / ‘Cause I need freedom, too,” Beyoncé sings. In playing that song, Harris is signaling why her supporters must vote."
This year's DNC will be the opposite of 1968 thanks to a lesson learned the hard way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-walz-dnc-1968-convention-lesson-rcna166958,"1968 was one of the worst years in American history. In the middle of that year was the worst Democratic National Convention in history. In Chicago. When the Democrats convene in the same place this month, their convention will be the opposite of 1968 thanks to the lesson learned the hard way then: Never again.  1968 was a year of death. The death of soldiers. The death of leaders. The death of dreams. 1968 was the deadliest year of the Vietnam War for American soldiers and the families who lost them. 16,899 American soldiers were killed in Vietnam that year, more than double the number of Americans killed in all wars since then. I went to my first military funeral in 1968 and watched a general cry burying his son, my cousin Johnny, a recent West Point graduate who led troops in combat for four months before winning the Silver Star on the day he was killed in action. Everyone knew someone who lost a loved one in Vietnam. We were living in a national death gloom on a scale unknown since then, including the fear of death in the millions of young men who were at or, in my case, approaching the age of eligibility for the draft — with no end of the war in sight. Thousands of those young men with draft cards in their wallets, alongside some of their girlfriends and sisters and peace advocates of all ages, went to Chicago in 1968 to demand an end to the Vietnam War. For them, the stakes at the convention were nothing less than life and death. By the time the anti-war protesters arrived at the convention, one of their candidates was dead. Heroes were hard to come by then, but the peace movement had a few. America’s most inspirational public speaker, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., broke with the president who signed the Civil Rights Act and eloquently opposed Lyndon Johnson’s war. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Sen. Robert Kennedy ran against the war in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries five years after the assassination of his older brother, President John F. Kennedy. On June 5, 1968, immediately after delivering his California primary victory speech, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. So ended the dream of another Kennedy presidency. The peace candidate left standing at the convention was the first candidate with the audacity to challenge the incumbent president in primaries, Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who shocked American politics with a strong showing in the New Hampshire primary against Johnson. Only 12 states had primaries in 1968, so the nomination had to be won at the convention. McCarthy won the most states and the most votes which earned him nothing at the convention. Every night of the convention was increasingly chaotic and violent outside the hall and inside the hall. Protesters were being beaten in the streets by what an investigative commission would later call a “police riot.” Chicago’s Mayor Richard Daley was disgracing himself inside the hall by using his army of convention floor operatives to try to silence, sometimes with fists, any dissent about delivering the nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a supporter of LBJ’s war, who didn’t run in a single primary. CBS’s Dan Rather was shoved to the floor as startled TV viewers watched. Walter Cronkite told the country, “I think we’ve got a bunch of thugs here, if I may be permitted to say so.” The next night, CBS reporter Mike Wallace took a punch to the jaw on the convention floor. When Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, a polished speaker and former Kennedy cabinet member, departed from his prepared remarks at the podium to condemn the “Gestapo tactics” of the Chicago police, we could all read Mayor Daley’s lips on TV shouting, “F--- you, you Jew son of a b----!” The networks turned to lip readers to confirm for us that the mayor said exactly what we thought he said. That night the Chicago police used so much tear gas Humphrey could smell it through the air vents of his hotel suite. The networks cut from live riot coverage to the moment on the convention floor when Humphrey won the nomination at 11:47 p.m. in what became the least important news of the night. So ended the dream of voters being able to stop the war on Election Day with an anti-war candidate. Richard Nixon watched the Democratic convention on TV knowing that no moment at the Republican convention would help him win the presidency more than every moment at the Democratic convention. Nixon, never a popular politician, won in November by less than one percent of the vote. The Democrats changed their rules so that the nomination would be awarded by voters in presidential primaries and they never had a contested convention again. This year, as concerns mounted about President Joe Biden’s position at the top of the ticket, suggestions popped up everywhere for how to find a new nominee if Biden stepped down. Virtually every suggestion included an open convention where, after the candidates campaigned against each other politely on talk shows or something such, the nomination would be decided by a dramatic vote of the delegates with the promise that it would be exciting TV. But every time I came upon the word “exciting” I saw the word “chaos” instead. Betting on reporters who’ve never seen an open convention to describe it as exciting instead of chaos seemed naïve. What if it took as many ballots to get a nominee as it now takes to get a speaker of the House? How weakened would the eventual nominee be by all the angry speeches against them? There wouldn’t have to be violence inside or outside the hall for today’s reporters to quickly reach for the word chaos. Professional Democrats, including convention delegates, can still feel the scar tissue of the 1968 Chicago convention. And they delivered a different outcome this year when, once again, the president dropped out of the race and tried to hand the nomination to his vice president: instant unity, no arguments, no punches thrown. Lesson learned.  "
JD Vance isn’t helping Trump’s ticket. Removing him would be even worse.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 18, 2024, 9:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-isnt-helping-trumps-ticket-removing-even-worse-rcna167006,"Experts often debate about the best approach to vice presidential selection: Try to balance out the presidential candidate’s characteristics, experience, and regional background? Or focus on finding a credible governing partner? But there’s almost implicit agreement on one principle: The vice presidential candidate should not harm the ticket. And it seems a lot easier for a VP pick to bring liability — from lack of proper vetting for scandals to lack of preparation of serve as president or lackluster campaign skills — than to really help the ticket. So far, Donald Trump seems like he may have failed that test with the selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, whose ratings have reportedly officially dipped to the lowest for any running mate in modern history. Vance was the choice of a confident candidate, looking at strong re-election odds after President Joe Biden’s notoriously poor performance during the June 27 debate and some positive media coverage after a July 13 assassination attempt. The driving factors behind Vance’s selection seem to be his recently honed Trumpist credentials, especially his statement about how he would have acted differently from Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice president, on Jan. 6, 2021. But the race has changed since then. Biden is no longer at the top of the Democratic ticket, for one. And Vance looks especially troubling compared to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom more Americans view favorably than unfavorably. Vance hasn’t been able — or hasn’t appeared to try very hard — to distance himself from controversial past statements about gender, abortion and people without children. As a result, there’s been some speculation about Trump replacing him. It feels important to say that the odds of that happening are very slim. But if it were to happen, how would this work exactly? From the standpoint of the formal rules of the Republican Party, it’s fairly straightforward. The rules lay out a similar process for replacing the presidential and vice presidential candidates after the convention; the most likely process would be a special meeting of the standing party committee members. (This is what happened when George McGovern replaced Sen. Thomas Eagleton with Sargent Shriver in 1972.) More complicated is the issue of ballot access — some state deadlines have already passed, and early voting starts in just a few weeks in some states. These are practical issues, and could be resolvable with some effort. Nevertheless, it’s important to get the ballots right. Even though we learned in 2016 that voters really cast their ballots for their states’ slate of electors, the wrong candidate for vice president would be a bad look at best and a potential constitutional confrontation at worst. (If no vice presidential candidate wins a majority of electors, the Senate chooses the vice president.) The informal element of the process would be similar in some ways to replacing the top spot, yet different in crucial aspects. As with replacing the presidential candidate, there would be some serious party coordination needs. Parties, as my co-author William Adler and I find in our work on running mates, play a role in shaping VP choices. Nevertheless, the presidential candidate plays a huge role in narrowing down the selection and making the final choice. This leaves room for all kinds of possibilities as we speculate about what could happen next. Importantly, Trump (or someone) would need to convince Vance to step down before the formal efforts to replace him would even be a realistic possibility. Then comes the question of who would replace Vance on the ticket. Here’s where things get interesting, with possible party jockeying in public and behind the scenes, as well as possible tensions within the campaign and between campaign and party. Some might theorize that Trump should look to politicians from the crucial swing states where the campaign has lost ground — start thumbing through the roster of GOP politicians from Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, for example. He could go back to his original short list and select Doug Burgum or Marco Rubio, both who have sought the presidential nomination and been through some national vetting. He could emphasize bringing someone from an underrepresented group to the ticket — Nikki Haley, Tim Scott or Vivek Ramaswamy (or Rubio) come to mind as possibilities. Ramaswamy, whose energetic RNC speech addressed some of the party’s outreach problems to minority communities, might especially be seen as a natural replacement for Vance. He’s also young and a loyal, dedicated Trump acolyte. But he has never held political office. Or Trump might look at some of the women whose names were floated earlier this year — like Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., to try to match the energy among women in light of Harris’ historic candidacy. These are approaches that Trump could try, if he chose to go the risky route of replacing the vice presidential candidate — which, again, is quite unlikely. And that doesn’t mean that they would even work. Politicians who were passed over on the first round may not want to join a ticket that’s since suffered some setbacks, and no longer seems like such a safe bet for victory. A choice aimed at “targeting” women, Midwesterners or minority voters also might not work. Social science research suggests that these efforts rarely succeed. A main purpose of the vice presidential candidate, beyond avoiding harm or generating negative news cycles, is to highlight the presidential candidate’s judgment and values. Because Trump has already served as president, most people have already made up their minds about how they feel about these factors. Dumping Vance would almost certainly generate a news cycle that would be negative for the former president, casting doubt on his judgment and drawing further attention to his running mate’s missteps and flaws. It’s likely simply too late for Trump to pick someone else. And VP candidate replacements happen so rarely, and are so closely connected to campaign disasters like McGovern’s in 1972, that it would be hard to achieve the quiet, under-the-radar rollout that might have been the wiser strategy in the first place."
"Democrats party in Chicago, the city Republicans most love to hate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-chicago-republicans-crime-rcna166573,"Fed up with the repeated condemnations of their city — condemnations that are regularly uttered by former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party and Fox News — a few enterprising Chicagoans encapsulated their rage on T-shirts last year. “Shut the f--- up about Chicago,” one of those shirts reads. “You don’t live here.” Don’t count on Republicans heeding that advice. Because the city is run by Democrats and because it is wrongly perceived as majority Black and singularly violent, Republicans have used “Chicago” as a kind of code word. Chicago, in their telling, is what you get when Democrats are in charge and Black people have run amok. In an argument that ignores the bright-blue city’s adjacency to bright-red Indiana and its anything-goes gun culture, Republican critics cite Chicago as proof that gun restrictions don’t work. But just as Democrats aren’t letting Republicans define their candidates, their policies or their record, they’re not letting the GOP define the city hosting this week’s Democratic National Convention. Throwing the party’s big party in Chicago is a more polite way of expressing the message on the T-shirts mentioned above. It is a way of saying that Chicago isn’t what Republicans want everybody else to believe it is. Let’s start with the idea of crime, specifically murders. Does Chicago have the most of any American city? Yes. But there are only two cities in the country — New York and Los Angeles — that are bigger than Chicago. In fact, with 2.7 million people, Chicago has more people than 15 states. In December, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., disregarded data that shows that Louisiana has the second-highest firearm death rate in the nation as he maligned Chicago as ""America’s largest outdoor shooting range."" As Jeff Asher, of the data analysis research firm AH Datalytics, said in a phone conversation Thursday, “Chicago has the most of everything only because it has almost the most people. In terms of [crime] rates, Chicago is usually outside of the top 10 in terms of murder rate, violent crime.” “Memphis; St. Louis; New Orleans; Birmingham, Alabama; Detroit,” he said when asked to name the most violent cities in the country. “Detroit is probably going to have the fewest murders since the early ’60s. Still has a high murder rate. New Orleans has seen a 40% reduction in murder relative to 2022. Still has a reasonably high murder rate, so that hasn’t changed.” But the emphasis stays on Chicago. Less than a week into his term as president, Trump tweeted, “If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!” In late 2019, when he finally made his first presidential visit to Chicago, he said of the city, “It’s embarrassing to us as a nation. All over the world, they’re talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison. It’s true.” “I think Chicago has issues,” Asher said, “but it’s also generally following the trends everywhere else. And it’s not the only place with issues.” Like so many other American cities, he said, in Chicago “murder rose substantially in 2020, 2021, and then has been coming down steadily ever since.” Generally speaking, Americans have become awful judges of how bad crime is. There used to be a relationship between the prevalence of crime and the perception of crime, Asher said, “but I don’t think there is anymore. I think people have created in their minds the situation where either crime is going up or the data is wrong.” In the 1990s, how people felt about crime “matched up pretty closely” to how much crime there was. “Ever since then, the share of people that told Gallup that crime is going up has been above 50% regardless of the direction that crime has gone that year.” My intent here is not to misrepresent Chicago as less violent than it is. One wishes Chicago were as safe as the much more populated New York City. But Americans misperceive actual levels of crime in part because Republicans want them to misperceive it. They need to hype crime levels to make the political points they want to make — because the actual data says otherwise. I say I wish Chicago were as safe as New York, but even New York is a crime-ridden hellhole in the Republican imagination. While visiting the city to show support for a former Republican president on trial for 34 felony counts, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., told Fox News, “The streets are filthy, they’re covered with people basically dying on drugs. They can’t even stand up. They’re falling over. There’s so much crime in the city. I can’t comprehend how people live there.” An October report from the Brennan Center for Justice crunched 2020-2022 data from the FBI and other sources and found that the murder rate per 100,000 people is highest in the South (8.0) and lowest in the Northeast (4.5). And that New York (with 5.3 murders per 100,000 people) was far less deadly than Atlanta, where Greene has been an untold number of times and apparently not been killed. Atlanta, according to Brennan, had 33.9 murders per 100,000 people. The Republican animosity for big American cities intensified during Ronald Reagan’s time in the White House, and it seems never to have let up. In the GOP imagination, every big city, especially if it’s run by a Democrat, is terrifying. If Republicans want to proffer Chicago as the epitome of urban America, meaning dangerous and frightening, then it’s important for Democrats to embrace Chicago to show that what happens in our cities matters to them, and that our country can’t succeed if our cities are forsaken. The “Shut the f--- up about Chicago” T-shirts were created by Anthony Hall, the owner of the clothing company Harebrained. Hall says he was inspired after a friend alerted him to a Fox News segment where a correspondent asked people in Naperville, Illinois — an hour’s drive from Chicago — their opinion of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson being sworn into office. That friend, Chicago marketer Matt Lindner, told Block Club Chicago that “Chicago has been the punching bag for people of certain political persuasions.” Chicagoans know the city has problems, he said, “but if you’re simply creating the narrative that it’s a war zone without being constructive about solutions or how there’s good people working on it, then,” well, see the T-shirt."
My common thread with JD Vance’s Mamaw make his remarks cut extra deep,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-mamaw-postmenopausal-female-rcna166666,"In 1984, a boy was born in a small town near Cincinnati and raised amid family chaos. Addiction. Abuse. Absent father. Poverty. His grandmother swooped in to provide consistency for him and his sister. He was grateful for his Mamaw’s steady presence even as she struggled to raise two grandchildren well into her 70s. That boy grew up to be Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, who in his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” credits his grandmother for his success. With a sense of guilt and empathy, he notes that she never got to realize her dream of becoming a lawyer for abused and neglected children. “Mamaw had her dreams but never the opportunity to pursue them,” he writes. He remembers watching her walk around the house cloaked in “weariness she wore like a dark piece of clothing,” and ignoring “whispers from a lot of people to Mamaw that she just needed to take a break and enjoy her golden years.” None of that compassion was evident, though, when Vance went on a podcast in 2020 and chewed the fat about the role that grandmothers play. The podcast host said “the whole purpose of the postmenopausal female” is to help raise grandchildren, and Vance heartily agreed. By agreeing with that, Vance did violence to his grandmother’s memory. The same woman who struggled to raise her own children as a teen mom was called upon to take full responsibility for him and his sister when she was a senior citizen. Due in no small part to sexist gender expectations like those expressed in the podcast and scant public policies to support families, Vance’s Mamaw was trapped in a loop of intense, oppressive caregiving that demands that women take care of some loved ones from the cradle and take care of other loved ones to the grave. Instead of offering caregiving grandmothers empty praise and sexist pigeonholes, Mr. Vance, how about some fundamental policy change? I was a naïve wife and mother of two before I realized how difficult it is to raise kids in this family-unfriendly nation. I could have used access to safe, quality, affordable child care and to universal health care that would have made it easier to switch jobs without fear of losing health insurance. Instead, I was parenting in a world where there’d been a women’s movement, but nothing else had moved. The stress was so intense that I left my job to work part time. The decision was a no-brainer. My children were loved and very much wanted. They didn’t ask to be here, and I owed them my best. But the sacrifice was monumental. According to the Center for American Progress, a woman who is 26 (the average age of first-time mothers in the United States) and earns $44,000 annually will lose a cumulative $707,000 over her career if she stays out of the workforce for five years. That amount includes potential raises, benefits and pensions she forgoes by dropping out of full-time work. Here Vance might ask me: “Where were the grandmothers to help you with your children?” Such a question would not only reflect the sexist values of a bygone era, but it would also ignore the current reality of women’s lives. I wish I could say my children’s grandmothers were knitting booties at home waiting for the chance to fulfill what Vance believes was their life’s purpose. Instead, my mother was 720 miles away, spending her post-menopausal years helping my father keep their small business afloat. My mother-in-law lived two doors away. But she had seven children, four of whom were still in school when I gave birth to her first grandchild. She was busy raising children while managing her husband’s medical practice. It’s a rare woman in her 50s who can afford to leave her job and uproot her life for the benefit of her grandchildren, and society needs to stop assuming that they should. At midlife, I found myself divorced after 25 years of marriage and eager to put my own dreams back on the priority list. After all, the children were launched, and I was not yet a grandmother. But in 2016, both of my parents were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. After trying to support them from afar, as the oldest child and the only girl, I was compelled to move to care for them. According to the Family Caregiver Alliance, caregiving reduces paid work hours for middle-aged women by about 41%. If an older female caregiver steps out of the workforce, the financial impact in terms of lost wages and Social Security benefits for the rest of her life is $324,044. This doesn’t account for the psychological and physical stress caregiving exacts upon women, or the additional out-of-pocket expenses they often expend to support the sick or aging. My dad passed away in 2020. The weekend of his funeral, my daughter moved in with her three kids to escape an abusive marriage. Four years later, the caregiving journey for my parents is over; my mother slipped away peacefully this year at age 90. But now I’m the full-time guardian of my grandchildren. When the youngest graduates from high school, I’ll be 76. But, according to Vance, at least I would have fulfilled the reason for which I was born. I count myself as lucky to have been in the position to give my best to my children, take care of my parents until they drew their last breaths and catch my grandchildren when life dealt them a raw deal. I would have sacrificed everything to support them. In fact, I practically have. At 64, I’ll never be able to make up for the income, savings and retirement benefits I’ve forgone supporting generations of people I love. Instead of relying upon women to provide a lifetime of free care for others, perhaps Vance can honor his Mamaw with policies that expand health insurance for family caregivers, establish a national child care system, provide broader access to mental health services and create caregiver-friendly tax and retirement policies? Until that happens, women will continue to shoulder the cost of providing decades of free care — and, in terms of blood and treasure, paying for it dearly."
Why Kamala Harris is getting the last laugh after Trump’s CNN interview criticism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:26 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 29, 2024, 8:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cnn-interview-rcna168598,"The hype preceding Kamala Harris’ first and utterly unremarkable “sit-down” interview as a 2024 presidential candidate is a reminder that nobody running against Donald Trump is ever graded fairly. Imagine arguing that Harris, an elected district attorney, attorney general of California, U.S. senator and incumbent vice president, should treat an interview with a CNN reporter as a high-stakes affair; that is, that she could say something that made her appear less qualified than Trump. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, apparently believing Trump’s ticket needed even more misogyny, suggested in a social media post Thursday that Harris would be incapable of holding her own. It is as it has ever been since Trump has been on the political stage: We watch to see if anything Trump says isn’t a lie, and we watch to see if other politicians say anything that’s the least bit false. In an ideal world, nobody would have been sitting on the edge of their seats wondering if Harris would sound knowledgeable or prepared for an interview — if only because she could never sound less knowledgeable or less prepared than her opponent so often does. The interest in the CNN sit-down was elevated, though, in large part because the media had made it such a big issue that she hadn’t done such an interview in the first place. And along with the suggestions that a candidate is deliberately avoiding the media come the suggestions that she’s afraid of the media. Harris exhibited no such fear Thursday. She came across as the typical politician — and I mean that in every sense. She directly answered the questions that she thought would benefit her candidacy, and she was deliberately evasive on specifics. To her credit, I think that the American media has wrongly contributed to what I’ll call the fetishization of a president’s first day in office. No, the vice president didn’t give a convincing answer when asked what she’d do “day one,” and yes, CNN’s Dana Bash asked the question again in a bid to try to force her to answer it. But the bigger problem isn’t so much that Harris didn’t give a straight answer; it’s an absurd question — even if it’s one that political journalists have come to think they have to ask. In setting the stage for the interview, recorded at Kim’s Café in Savannah, Georgia, CNN showed a clip of Trump saying of Harris, “She’s not a smart person.” That’s the same tack Vance took in his social media post that likened Harris to a young beauty contestant completely overwhelmed by an interview question. It’s hard to know exactly what part of that attack on Harris’ smarts we should assign to sexism and which part we should assign to racism. But there’s no denying the presence of both. Former President Barack Obama, president of the Harvard Law Review and a “senior lecturer” in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, was one of the most cerebral presidents we’ve seen, and, yet, there were billboards and bumper stickers that, referring to the country where his father was born, read, “Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing its idiot.” But Harris, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem recently pointed out, doesn’t want to get trapped in questions about identity. We saw that when she addressed Bash’s question about Trump’s lying and saying she only recently described herself as Black. She told Bash, “Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.” Nor did she focus on race and sex when asked about the viral photo of her grandniece watching her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. She said she wants to be the president for everybody. Her opponents are going to work hard, though, to reduce her to those elements of her identity. And slyly suggest that because of those elements she’s not up to the task. But they’re the ones seemingly not up to the task, seeing as how they set a bar so low that she couldn’t help but sail right over it. In response to the interview, Trump described it as “BORING!!!” He wasn’t wrong about that. But I think Harris is banking on voters’ choosing boring over the drama — no, let’s be real and call it the chaos — that Trump inevitably brings."
I’m a combat veteran. Here’s why Trump’s Arlington stunt was so insulting.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-arlington-national-cemetery-grave-photo-rcna168767,"Serving in a unit like the 101st Airborne Division can feel like a job. It’s a normal, everyday thing. Even in combat. It’s not until after you leave a famous unit like that — after you leave the Army, in fact — that you realize it is a privilege to lead and serve alongside such soldiers. It’s not until much later, among the regular people at the office, that you realize how unlikely it is that anyone around you would ever grab three guys and come running if you were pinned down or out of ammo. In the Army, you take those things for granted because everybody does it. They do it. They don’t question it. They don’t all survive. I survived and I’m old now. Not truly old. I’m 46. But old in the Army sense. I’m no longer carved out of wood. My left hamstring groans at the thought of running more than a mile. Doctors have taken an interest in my colon. But I realize this is a privilege. It’s a gift. Being old, I mean. Aging out. For once, I’m finally aware of the privilege in the moment. I am old. But I have friends who are still in their 20s. Friends who should be in their 40s. Some of them are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. That is what makes Arlington a special place. And for those of us who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, Section 60 — the burial site of hundreds of service members killed in those wars — is the inner sanctum. It is the most sacred plot among more than 600 hallowed acres. When I lived in Northern Virginia during Barack Obama’s administration, I avoided Section 60 studiously. It was too much, and still too close. There was always that looming sense that it could’ve been me. Maybe it should’ve been me. So I didn’t visit until I was about to move back to Dallas. An Army buddy told me I had to go before I left D.C. So I did. Finally. All of this is to say that, to combat veterans, Arlington National Cemetery has the same power that all holy places have. And that is why Donald Trump’s recent behavior is so repulsive. Trump was so eager to use Arlington’s Section 60 as a backdrop for a campaign event this week that he may have broken federal laws against politicizing the burial ground to do it. Trump’s staff also shoved aside a cemetery official trying to stop them. He even posed for a photograph over a U.S. Marine’s gravesite, grinning and giving a thumbs-up. The moment was jaw-droppingly crass and vulgar, as all of Trump’s are. It defiled sacred ground. But of course, Trump’s disregard for military tradition and his disdain for military service members is well documented. This incident was only the latest in a long line. Trump began his adult life dodging the draft for Vietnam. Someone else went in his place. Maybe that person survived. Or maybe they’re buried at Arlington with thousands of other Vietnam veterans. 'Whatever the outcome, the thought has never troubled Trump. He later told Howard Stern that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases was “my personal Vietnam.” When those comments resurfaced during his first run for president, his supporters shrugged them off. “It’s a joke!” they said. “He’s a showman!” If it had only ended there. In 2015, responding to criticism from Sen. John McCain, a former POW, Trump claimed, “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” However one feels about the Vietnam War, few Americans have given more for their country than John McCain. That didn’t matter to Trump. A year later, after Trump proposed the first version of his “Muslim ban,” the parents of Army officer Humayun Khan took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Khan is buried at Arlington, having been killed in Iraq in 2004. His parents gave an impassioned plea to voters, laying out how service members of all faiths had sacrificed their lives in America’s wars. They denounced Trump’s attempt to single out Muslims. He responded by spending days attacking the grieving Gold Star family. General Mark Milley told The Atlantic that when he invited a wounded, wheelchair-bound soldier to sing “God Bless America” at Milley’s welcoming ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, Trump admonished him. “Why do you bring people like that here?” Trump asked, according to Milley. “No one wants to see that, the wounded.” On a trip to France in 2018, Trump declined a scheduled visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where more than 2,200 U.S. service members are buried. “Why should I go to that cemetery?” he asked staff members. “It’s filled with losers.” This horrific statement was confirmed by Trump’s then-chief of staff, John Kelly, a former Marine general whose own son was killed in Afghanistan and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Kelly also confirmed that in another conversation on the same trip, Trump called the Marines who died at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. And just a few weeks ago, Trump told an audience that the Congressional Medal of Freedom he’d awarded to Republican donor Miriam Adelson was “much better” than the Medal of Honor. Trump said the civilian award was superior because Medal of Honor recipients are “either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets or they are dead.” These are not one-off statements by a rhetorically reckless buffoon. This man harbors deep resentment toward the military and those who’ve sacrificed in service. Even when he poses with a family — as he did at Arlington this week — he only does so to enhance his campaign or his political prospects. Trump’s use for the military and our dead extends only as far as it suits him. All Americans should keep this front of mind as we head into the fall. In particular, veterans should remember that Donald Trump’s behavior at Arlington National Cemetery this week epitomizes not only how he is a menace to the United States, but how he is an enemy of everything we fought for."
Donald Trump's disrespectful Arlington photo-op should not come as a shock,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-arlington-photo-military-jd-vance-rcna168853,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 28 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes."" If there’s one thing we know about Donald Trump, it’s that he’s going to be exactly who he is — all the time, every day, no matter what. Nothing ever really seems to stick to him politically. Trump was just indicted all over again by another federal grand jury and he’s celebrating an endorsement from a suspected whale decapitator, but there is a scandal that has the former president and his aides scrambling for cover. It has to do with a bizarre photo op he did on Monday at Arlington National Cemetery. Trump can be seen grinning and giving the camera a thumbs-up over the grave of a Marine killed in Afghanistan. That appearance was off-putting enough by itself. But then, NPR reported that Trump campaign staff at Arlington had gotten into an altercation with a worker at the cemetery over their filming among the graves of the dead. The Trump campaign’s top spokesperson downplayed the incident in a statement to NBC News: “For whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony.” But the worker had a good reason, Arlington National Cemetery suggested, telling NBC News that a report has been filed on the incident and adding in a statement: Trump’s co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, told NBC News that Trump went to the cemetery to honor Gold Star families not to film a political campaign ad and Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio tried to play it off, saying it wasn’t a political ad and there “just happened to be a camera there.” There just happened to be a camera? Trump went to a military cemetery to film a video reminding viewers of the U.S. deaths during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, blaming his successor for them without mentioning that Trump tied his successor’s hands by agreeing to a withdrawal timeline set by the Taliban. But that’s not a political ad, right? But Trump wasn’t the only politician capitalizing off of that Arlington visit. He was accompanied by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah. Cox used photos of the event to solicit donations in a campaign email — a violation of federal law and something the governor now acknowledges was a mistake. Trump’s team, however, isn’t admitting any mistakes. Instead, they’ve got Vance, the member of the Republican ticket with some military experience, responding on the campaign trail. Vance chastised the media for turning the altercation “into a national news story” and noted that Trump was invited by the family of the fallen marine: ""They wanted Donald Trump there, and thank God that we have a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them.” It’s true Trump was invited … but not by all the families of all the 400,000 veterans and dependents buried at Arlington — who didn’t and can’t consent to being used as props by a few other bereaved families. Beyond Vance disparaging someone who works at Arlington National Cemetery for enforcing the rules, is Trump really “a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them?” Donald “I don’t like losers, I like people that weren’t captured” Trump? The Donald Trump who spent much of his first presidential campaign attacking the parents of an American Army officer who died in Iraq in 2004? The Donald Trump who, as president, fumbled the name of a fallen soldier in a condolence call to his widow then bickered with her and knocked her in interviews?  The Donald Trump, who according to his chief of staff — a retired four-star Marine general — refused to pay his respects at a veterans cemetery in Europe, saying, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” And who, on that same trip, called the more than 1,800 Marines who died at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. Or was it the Donald Trump who reportedly hated being filmed or photographed with wounded veterans? At Army General Mark Milley’s welcoming ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 2019, the general had chosen a combat-wounded soldier, Luis Avila, to sing “God Bless America” at the ceremony. Milley claimed that afterward, the president told him, “Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.”  Less than two weeks ago, Trump used war-wearied American service members as a punchline to talk up one of his biggest political donors. Recalling the moment Miriam Adelson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Trump told the crowd: So you could be forgiven for looking at all of this and thinking that Trump only has respect for the most revered American institutions — the military, the justice system, the free elections — only when they’re working for him.

The interview comes after the vice president faced intense criticism for not formally sitting down with the media since entering the presidential race.  The political operative in me gets what Harris is doing. She’s spending her time on the campaign trail, making her case to voters. Why not push off the first big interview for as long as you can? On the other hand, as a citizen — and as someone who loves journalism and believes in transparency — I can acknowledge it’s not the best look. I’m not saying she has to do these huge prime-time interviews with well-known anchors but, why not sit down for an interview with a local journalist? She’s traveling around the country, hitting swing states — she should take advantage of that. If she’s on the road in Georgia, this is the perfect opportunity to sit down with a journalist there.  Harris has to show the American people she’s accessible and she can think on her feet. This is just an unforced error on her campaign’s part. It makes her look like she is too protected, too hesitant. Certainly, Harris can give an interview — after all, she’s the vice president of the United States."
"RFK Jr. says his endorsement of Trump is a ‘really difficult issue’ for his wife, actor Cheryl Hines",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 2:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-wife-cheryl-hines-trump-endorsement-rcna168858,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, is not on board with his support for Donald Trump. Speaking with TMZ, Kennedy said he had endorsed the former president against his wife’s wishes, calling it a “really difficult issue” for her. “This is the opposite of what she would want to do,” he said. “She went along with it because she loves me and she wanted to be supportive of me, but it was not something that she ever encouraged, I would say.” Kennedy said his wife had encouraged him — “out of compassion” — to accept an invitation to meet with Trump after the July assassination attempt. He said she then attended a meeting he had with Trump to make sure that no “hasty decisions” were made. “Her trepidation about this and discomfort with this ... were the dominant feelings,” said Kennedy, who suspended his independent bid for president last week after initially seeking the Democratic nomination. “She’s a lifelong Democrat and the idea of me supporting Donald Trump as president was just ... something that she would have never imagined, that she never wanted in her life.” Hines had released a statement on X after her husband left the race to thank those who worked on his campaign, but the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star made no mention of his support for Trump. Hines has had to distance herself from her husband’s political stances before, including when he brought up the Holocaust at an anti-vaccine rally. She also has faced criticism from her peers over Kennedy, with “The West Wing” star Bradley Whitford calling her out last week for staying silent about her husband’s support for Trump. Kennedy told TMZ that he “had to suppress some strong feelings” about Whitford’s comments, which he called “a template for bullying.” Hines’ disdain for Trump had been clear long before her husband dropped out of the race. Earlier this year, when a Variety reporter asked Kennedy whether he would accept an offer to be Trump’s running mate, he pointed at Hines and said: “I don’t think that my marriage would survive it.” Hines responded: “I think he’s right.”"
Nebraska Supreme Court to decide on laws allowing those with felony convictions to vote,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/nebraska-felony-conviction-voting-appeal-rcna168863,"With all the voting rights litigation mounting in courts ahead of the 2024 election, another important case to watch is unfolding in Nebraska. The state Supreme Court just heard arguments over whether people with felony convictions can vote.     Continuing a well-known theme, the case stems from Republican court efforts to seek political advantage over Democrats at the ballot box.  The case had a more bipartisan origin, when state lawmakers passed legislation in April to allow people with felony convictions to vote after they’ve completed their sentences. The new law built on a 2005 law that let people with felony convictions vote two years after they’ve completed their sentences.     But just before the new law was set to take effect last month, Nebraska’s Republican attorney general, Mike Hilgers, opined that both laws are unconstitutional, reasoning that only the state pardons board, not the Legislature, can restore voting rights.  And who’s on that pardons board? That would be Hilgers, Republican Secretary of State Bob Evnen and the state’s Republican governor, Jim Pillen, who didn’t veto the new law but nonetheless expressed constitutional concerns and encouraged Hilgers and Evnen to “promptly” look into it. Backed by Hilgers’ legal opinion, Evnen told election officials not to register people with felony convictions to vote if they hadn’t been pardoned. The court heard oral argument Wednesday, and its decision carries vast implications. The American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the case on behalf of would-be voters, told the state top court in a filing ahead of the hearing that The implications of the court’s impending ruling could be national: While Nebraska has historically voted Republican, like Maine it doesn’t use a winner-take-all system for its five Electoral College votes. Rather, the winner of the popular vote gets two and then the other three are split among its congressional districts. That led Joe Biden to pick up one of them in 2020, from the competitive Omaha-area district, which Barack Obama also won in 2008.

Harris sends letter to HBCU students as her college voter push continues,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 1:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-hbcu-letter-election-rcna168874,"Ahead of a planned college campus tour in battleground states, Vice President Kamala Harris penned a letter to students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on Wednesday, encouraging them to vote and laying out the stakes of this year’s elections.  The Democratic presidential nominee released her letter as an ad through Watch The Yard, which publishes content related to Black colleges and universities, Black Greek organizations and the Black collegiate experience. An HBCU graduate in her own right, the vice president has spent a lot of time on college campuses mobilizing voters over the last few years. In September 2023, she went on a “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” to promote reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ equality and freedom from book bans. She also appeared on ESPN during a bowl game for her alma mater, Howard University, last winter to tout the value of HBCUs. And she was back at Howard earlier this month hyping up students. The bonds she built with college voters then seem to have sowed the seeds for the surge in young voter support she’s seen as Democrats’ presidential nominee. So it follows that Harris and her team are making even more concerted efforts to get college students to the polls. They recently announced a “back to school"" campaign to engage young voters across 150 campuses in battleground states. Her letter to HBCU students this week is more proof of how crucial the Harris-Walz campaign thinks young, college-going voters will be to their election bid this fall. In the letter, Harris said her time at Howard had a “profound impact” on her and said HBCUs are where Black youths are “constantly reminded you are young, gifted, and Black.” She said college is “when I started to become politically engaged” and where she “learned that progress in our country happens when young people fight for it.” Harris said college students’ record turnout in 2020 is the reason she’s vice president today, and she declared “fundamental freedoms” are at stake this election, citing voting rights, marriage equality and bodily autonomy under threat from anti-abortion lawmakers.  “Your vote has never mattered more,” she wrote. “I know that when young people fight for progress, it changes the course of our nation. I believe in you. I am inspired by you. And I am rooting for you.” Both the Harris campaign and its allies, and the Trump campaign and its allies, are taking diverging approaches to college voters this year. While Harris and Trump both speak about the need for young voters to turn out, Trump, tellingly, is the only candidate in the race whose allies have openly promoted efforts to make it harder for college students to vote."

The vaccination campaign is due to start on Sunday, said Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s senior official for the region.” * The U.S. economy: “The U.S. economy grew faster in the second quarter of 2024 than first reported, suggesting there was little sign of a slowdown through the first six months of the year.

The Supreme Court made Jack Smith’s case much harder. His new indictment proves it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-indictment-jack-smith-supreme-court-rcna168667,"In the wake of the Supreme Court's stunning decision on presidential immunity, legal experts had a variety of predictions of what would happen next in special counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case. But once Smith's office advised Washington, D.C., federal judge Tanya Chutkan earlier this month that it needed more time to ""assess the new precedent ... including through consultation with other Department of Justice components,"" I realized one reason Smith could need more time was to supersede, or replace, his own indictment to resolve the Supreme Court's clearest concerns. And on Tuesday, Smith did exactly that. Others — including my colleagues Jordan Rubin and Hayes Brown — have written about the changes in the new indictment, both big and small, and what's likely to happen next in the litigation. But assuming the stripped-down indictment can survive both judicial review and November's election (if Trump wins, we can assume his Department of Justice will put an end to his federal criminal cases), what really interests me is Smith's removal from the indictment of multiple alleged conversations between Trump and executive branch officials and how those deletions have complicated his case at trial. The charges against Trump — all four of which remain — necessitate showing not only that Trump falsely claimed there was outcome-determinative fraud in the 2020 presidential election and that he had won, but that he knew these claims were false at the time he made them and conspired to change the election outcome. The original indictment alleged that the sources of Trump's knowledge included senior Department of Justice leaders, including then-Attorney General Bill Barr and his successor, then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, as well as senior White House lawyers, namely then-White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy Pat Philbin. That document quotes Philbin as having told Trump, ""[T]here is no world, there is no option in which you do not leave the White House [o]n January 20th."" In the new indictment, however, Smith has eliminated any and all references to conversations in which DOJ leaders, White House staff, and agencies within the intelligence community allegedly informed Trump that one or more claims about voter fraud were unproven and/or false — or simply that he had lost the election period. It's no secret why Smith did this. Under the Supreme Court's immunity decision last month, Trump's communications with executive branch aides are either part of his core constitutional powers, as the court held with respect to his interactions with DOJ leaders, or at the very least, within the outer perimeter of his official duties so that they are presumably immune both from prosecution and as evidence even as to his unofficial conduct. But now, the case won't include some of what seemed to be the most damning proof that Trump knew he lost. The conversations through which Barr, Rosen and Rosen's then-acting deputy, Rich Donoghue, disabused Trump of his false claim that votes cast through voting machines had been ""switched"" from him to Biden in multiple, contested states? Gone. The time Barr also told Trump there was no evidence of a ""suspicious vote dump"" in Detroit? Gone. How about when Rosen and Donoghue separately told Trump that the claim there had been 200,000-plus more votes than voters in Pennsylvania was also untrue? Cut. Or what of Trump telling then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley in early January 2021 that ""it’s too late for us"" to take action on an ""overseas national security issue"" and they should ""give that to the next guy?"" Nowhere to be found. Then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe's assuring Trump that there was no outcome-determinative foreign interference in the election? Like it never happened.  The superseding indictment is a reflection of a weird, dual reality for Smith and his team: In order to save their case, they also had to jettison some of their best proof. The question now is whether what's left is powerful enough to prevail. My guess is yes, in part because some of the most important witnesses are still important in GOP politics and therefore, all the more credible if they tell the truth. Indeed, without testimony from official Trump World, those who directly communicated with Trump about his failure to win come from two camps: state officials who refused to do his bidding and his own campaign staff. (The Supreme Court’s opinion suggests Trump’s discussions with both state officials and his campaign staff constitute unofficial, personal acts that do not qualify for immunity.) Consider, for example, two events that the new indictment alleges went down on Dec. 8, 2020. First, the indictment notes that a ""Senior Campaign Advisor — who spoke with the Defendant on a daily basis and had informed him on multiple occasions that various fraud claims were untrue,"" dismissively described those fraud claims in an email as ""just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership"" that unsurprisingly had resulted in more than 30 court losses to date. Those details are hardly new, but they could carry even greater weight going forward given their source: once and current Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is perhaps even more prominent within the inner circle today than he was in 2020. The new indictment also alleges that Trump called Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr and asked him to join the so-called ""original jurisdiction"" lawsuit that Texas had filed in the Supreme Court. But Carr declined, telling Trump, according to the indictment, ""that officials had investigated various claims of election fraud in the state and were not seeing evidence to support them."" And Carr, who defeated a Trump-endorsed opponent to win re-election in 2022, remains unbowed, at least so far, refusing to reopen an investigation of the 2020 election in Georgia's Fulton County despite a directive from the Georgia Election Board. I can't imagine Miller or Carr would necessarily welcome testifying in a Trump trial. But I also can't envision the Supreme Court ruling their testimony is ultimately off-limits under the contours of the immunity decision. The special counsel and those weighing in at the Justice Department understand this. And even as they recover from their Supreme Court loss, they are playing the long game.    "
I’m a childfree teacher. JD Vance thinks that means I’m ‘brainwashing’ students.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-childless-teacher-brainwash-randi-weingarten-rcna168805,"In recently resurfaced comments, Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance asserted that childfree teachers “brainwash” and “destroy” the minds of children. As an educator, I hope women everywhere, in every profession, are listening. During a 2021 leadership forum hosted by the Center for Christian Virtue, Vance was asked how he’d handle issues with schools while senator. In his answer, he took aim at Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, saying, “You know, so many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they’re people without kids, trying to brainwash the minds of our children.” “If she wants to brainwash and destroy the mind of children,” he added, “she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.” To be clear, Weingarten is stepmother to two daughters and has publicly described herself as “a mother by marriage.” But her family status is irrelevant to her capacity to lead the nation’s teachers.  I began my career as a middle school English teacher in New Jersey. When I was studying for licensure, I was required to take university and state exams focused on content knowledge and best practices, all with a foundation in child psychology and the science of learning. I gained experience designing lesson plans, assessments and rubrics that account for the myriad learning styles that populate classrooms across this country each year. At no time during my path to teaching was I questioned about the status of my womb and whether gestation would enhance my ability to work with children and their families. When I became a teacher, my students and I read books together. I taught them to analyze text and write essays across several genres. In my classroom, students learned about the art of informed argumentation and how — in the words of Plato — opinion is the lowest form of knowledge. They also learned new vocabulary and grammar and everything else that one might expect of a classroom in which literacy development is front and center. I like to think that what my students learned while in my care helped set them up to pursue success in their chosen professions. When I met my students’ parents to talk about their child’s progress, at no time was I questioned about my reproductive status, or how that status related to my ability to educate their children. All parents simply want to know that the person standing at the front of the room is competent in their chosen profession and cares about their child as a whole person. I now teach at the college level, in a teacher preparation program. My students are some of our nation’s future teachers. My curriculum includes the nuts and bolts of teaching and has been adapted to account for the issues facing schools, classrooms and students today. We work on how to not only create lesson plans, but also build inclusive classroom communities where all children feel safe and cared for, and where parents can feel confident knowing that their children are in good hands. It doesn’t even occur to me to wonder about my students’ reproductive organs or their future goals for family planning. Why? Because I’m not weird. A teacher’s willingness to be a mother, or a desire to remain childfree, has absolutely no bearing on their capacity to care for the children who will some day occupy a seat in their classroom. Also, not all of my students have wombs. Which leads me to my next point: It’s no accident that Vance speaks this way about a female-dominated profession. He has a well-deserved reputation for demeaning women and their work at nearly every turn. Just as he denounced childfree women who have cats, and said nothing of the childfree men who also have cats, so too does he also vilify teachers who do not have children, and says nothing of the fact that not all teachers have wombs. Perhaps next, it’s women in any profession with only one or two children who meet his disapproval. Vance has shown us that, indeed, there is no bottom, no misogynistic low for which he will not strive. It’s fitting that Vance’s comments have resurfaced as a new school year begins. As I type this, all teachers — regardless of whether they have children — are currently digging into their own pockets for supplies that experience and wisdom tells them their new students will need. I personally know teachers who keep drawers stocked with nonperishable food for students to access, no questions asked. Every day, my own social media feed is full of teachers posting links to their classroom wish lists, pleading for assistance that they can’t get anywhere else. Many of the folks I describe here are childfree, but they care and want to do a good job for other peoples’ children, which is why they go into teaching to begin with. It goes without saying that the Republican Party has long had an axe to grind for educators. For years, GOP lawmakers like Vance and their allies have lobbed misinformed attacks against us and the work we do. Most recently, the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 proposes dismantling the Department of Education, which — not coincidentally — is the entity that funds public schools. But Vance’s comments are not really about teachers. He has made it clear to American women: There is nothing we can do outside of raising children and grandchildren that meets his approval. And all coming from a man who can’t even seem to order doughnuts in a way that isn’t cringe-inducing."
Gov. Greg Abbott's brag about a mass voter purge in Texas is not what it seems,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-voter-roll-purge-greg-abbott-rcna168815,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week that more than 1 million people have been removed from the state's voter rolls over the past three years, touting the removals as part of an effort to protect voting rights and prevent voter fraud — an already illegal and exceedingly rare occurrence that Republicans have made a centerpiece of their attacks on immigration. In a statement on Monday, the Republican governor attributed the mass purge of ineligible voters from state records — which he said included “noncitizens, deceased voters, and people who moved to another state” — to election legislation he signed in 2021. “Illegal voting in Texas will never be tolerated,” Abbott said. “We will continue to actively safeguard Texans’ sacred right to vote while also aggressively protecting our elections from illegal voting.” But his statement doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Election experts have said that such removals are simply routine voter roll maintenance (not to mention a requirement under federal law) and warned that Abbott's remarks could reinforce distrust in the election process. (“A spokesman for Mr. Abbott referred questions to the secretary of state’s office,” The New York Times reported.) A coalition of voting rights groups in the state have also raised concerns that eligible voters may have been wrongly flagged as noncitizens and removed from voter rolls — which is already happening in other states, as NBC News reported. Abbott's claim that he is protecting voter rights is also suspect, given that Texas Republicans have been accused of creating unnecessary burdens for nonwhite and disabled voters by limiting access to the ballot box, especially in blue pockets of the state. Just last week, state Attorney General Ken Paxton ordered raids on the homes of prominent Latino Democrats and members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), a nonpartisan Latino civil rights groups. Paxton claimed that the operation is part of an ""election integrity investigation,"" but his office did not explain why specific homes were targeted. LULAC said that it had not been informed of the details of the allegations against any of its members. The group has asked the U.S. Justice Department to open a probe into Paxton's office for potentially violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
Why JD Vance heard boos while appealing to firefighters’ union,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-heard-boos-firefighters-union-walz-election-2024-rcna168855,"It’s no secret that both the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets would love to receive a 2024 endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters, which is meeting this week in Boston. It’s why Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz addressed the labor union on Wednesday and received a warm welcome. A day later, his Republican counterpart’s reception was noticeably frostier. NBC News reported: I realize there’s a degree of subjectivity in such matters, but the booing sounded pretty robust to me. A Washington Post report added that the GOP vice presidential nominee was booed yet again during the same appearance after he referred to the Republican Party as “the party of the American worker.” It’s not too surprising that much of the audience in Boston knew better. As a New York Times report summarized just last week, Vance’s running mate has a record that trails after him like cans tied to a bumper: “[T]he Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board under Mr. Trump generally took a deregulatory approach to worker issues and union protections. His administration argued that employers should be able to prevent workers from bringing class action lawsuits, and sought funding cuts for workplace safety programs. His deputy labor secretary once worked as a lobbyist to prevent the federal minimum wage from applying to the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth where some workers earned less than $1 an hour.” An Associated Press report last year came to a similar conclusion: “[U]nion leaders say Trump’s record in the White House speaks for itself. Union leaders have said his first term was far from worker-friendly, citing unfavorable rulings from the nation’s top labor board and the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as unfulfilled promises of automotive jobs.” It was around this same time that the former president suggested UAW union members shouldn’t pay their union dues. That anti-labor rhetoric was hardly unusual. Just two weeks ago Trump participated in an online event with conspiratorial billionaire Elon Musk, whom the Republican candidate praised for taking a hardline with employees. “They go on strike,” the former president said. “I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, ‘That’s OK. You’re all gone. You’re all gone. So every one of you is gone,’ and you are the greatest.” The New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg soon followed with a column on this, with a headline that read, “Trump Is No Longer Even Pretending to Champion the Working Class.” With this in mind, if Vance was surprised to be booed, he shouldn’t have been."

5th Circuit sides with nonviolent marijuana user in Second Amendment appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 10:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/5th-circuit-nonviolent-marijuana-user-second-amendment-rcna168773,"We’ve seen some absurd gun rulings recently, including a Trump-appointed Kansas judge’s decision dismissing machine-gun charges under the Second Amendment and Supreme Court precedent. A new ruling out of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — which has handed down its share of wacky opinions on all sorts of issues, including guns — shows that the Supreme Court’s firearms jurisprudence, however illogical it is, can lead to a more sensible result. That ruling came Wednesday in the federal case of Paola Connelly, described by the 5th Circuit panel as “a non-violent, marijuana smoking gunowner.” One of the laws she was charged with violating in Texas was 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3), for allegedly possessing firearms and ammunition as an unlawful user of a controlled substance. The three-judge panel summarized the facts this way: To figure out whether her Second Amendment rights were infringed upon, the panel had to decide, under recent Supreme Court precedent, whether the law “is consistent with our history and tradition of firearms regulation.” The panel concluded that history and tradition may support “some limits on a presently intoxicated person’s right to carry a weapon,” but not “disarming a sober person based solely on past substance usage.” So the 5th Circuit agreed with Connelly’s challenge as it applied to her case specifically (what’s called an “as-applied” challenge) while rejecting her challenge to the law itself (what’s called a “facial” challenge). “Just as there is no historical justification for disarming citizens of sound mind, there is no historical justification for disarming a sober citizen not presently under an impairing influence,” Judge Kurt Engelhardt wrote for the panel. The Trump appointee was joined by Judges Jerry Smith and Irma Carrillo Ramirez, who are Reagan and Biden appointees, respectively. Government prosecutors had analogized drug use to historical restrictions on the mentally ill, but the appeals court rejected that comparison, reasoning that: “While intoxicated, she may be comparable to a severely mentally ill person whom the Founders would disarm. But, while sober, she is like a repeat alcohol user between periods of intoxication, whom the Founders would not disarm.”  The court likewise rejected the government’s reliance on the historical disarming of “dangerous” people: While true and seemingly supporting a logical result here, such an observation highlights the absurdity of the analysis in these cases in modern times. It’s an analysis that the likes of Hunter Biden will want to harness in his own case, after he was found guilty in Delaware federal court in June on multiple counts, including the 922(g)(3) charge. Biden’s case falls under a different appeals court, and it would take another Supreme Court ruling to set a national standard. In the high court’s most recent Second Amendment ruling this past term, United States v. Rahimi, the court upheld gun restrictions on people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. The ruling suggested that the court isn’t prepared to take its 2022 Bruen precedent, which laid out the historical analysis test, as far as it can go. The drug-related issue is one of multiple important questions raised by recent Supreme Court rulings, but as the Rahimi case showed, it will be up to the justices to handle each specific issue as it comes to them.

In remarks at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Vance cited the deaths of 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, blaming the vice president for not having investigated the withdrawal or firing anyone. “Sometimes mistakes happen — that’s just the nature of government, the nature of military service. But to have those 13 Americans lose their lives and not fire a single person is disgraceful,” he said. “Kamala Harris is disgraceful.” “She wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up?” he added. “She can — she can go to hell.” Vance's comments are not just disrespectful — although they follow the example that Trump has maintained throughout his political career — they're also inaccurate. As The Washington Post pointed out, the criticism from the Harris' campaign spokesperson was merely to call the incident “pretty sad” but “not surprising coming from the Trump team” on CNN on Wednesday, and Harris herself has not said anything about it in public. Even as Vance has bristled at the criticism, accusing the Harris campaign of “trying to make a massive political issue” out of the incident and blaming the media for having “turned it into a national news story,” the Trump campaign's own indignant response to the incident has kept the story in the headlines. Rather than admitting it had defied federal laws that bar political activity at gravesites in Arlington, the campaign released a video that included the grave of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a combat veteran who died in 2020, without his family's permission. Marckesano's sister told The New York Times that the Trump campaign did not adhere to visitation rules, saying, ""We hope those visiting this sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected accordingly."" In addition to the scandal of politicking at the cemetery, a Trump aide pushed a cemetery employee out of the way so that the campaign could take photos and video, NBC News reported Wednesday, citing two Defense Department officials. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the employee a “liar” in response. What's more, Cheung and Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita have disparaged the employee in deeply personal terms, suggesting she had a “mental health episode.” The employee initially filed an incident report with military officials but later declined to press charges, fearing retaliation from Trump supporters, according to the Times."
"The U.S. manufacturing story JD Vance wants to be true, but isn’t",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 9:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-manufacturing-story-jd-vance-wants-true-isnt-rcna168822,"During his latest appearance on “Meet the Press,” Sen. JD Vance eagerly boasted to NBC News’ Kristen Welker that Donald Trump brought “manufacturing jobs back to our country” during his term. Moments later, the Republican vice presidential nominee went into more detail. “Because if you go back to the Trump presidency, we had 12,000 factories that were built during Donald Trump’s presidency,” the Ohio senator declared. For those keeping an eye on Vance’s rhetoric, the comments were familiar: He made the identical claim, nearly word for word, a week earlier on “Fox News Sunday.” What’s more, it’s not just the senator: Trump himself has repeatedly made the same boast, including in his final State of the Union address before losing his re-election bid. So, is it true? The Washington Post published a very helpful fact-check report. Quite right. For the purposes of data analysis, the Labor Department counts “factories” as businesses that “transform materials or substances into new products.” In other words, if you opened a bakery, that’s a “factory.” If you knit cute little frogs and sell them on your porch, that’s a “factory,” too. It’s why Vance’s claim garnered the dreaded “Four Pinocchios” assessment in the Post’s report. And while that assessment seemed more than fair given the circumstances, we can go a bit further and note that those looking for an administration with more legitimate grounds to boast about American manufacturing shouldn’t look to Trump; they should look to his successor. CNBC reported last week: In fact, the aforementioned Post article noted that if Vance wants to brag about the creation of nearly 18,000 additional “manufacturing establishments” under Trump, that same number would be nearly 39,000 under Biden. As The New York Times’ Paul Krugman summarized in a column in April, “President Biden appears to be presiding over the kind of manufacturing surge Trump had promised. ... [T]he fact is that Biden is actually doing something Trump boasted about but never achieved: promoting a significant revival in U.S. manufacturing.”"

Why Trump should avoid relitigating his infamous ‘dictator’ comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-avoid-relitigating-infamous-dictator-comments-rcna168798,"Donald Trump covered a fair amount of ground in his latest interview with Phil McGraw (better known as “Dr. Phil”), but one unexpected part of their conversation touched on notorious comments the former president made late last year, when the Republican candidate talked about becoming a “dictator.” A Fox News report summarized: “And I said ‘one day,’ because I wanna do the energy and I wanna strengthen the border, one day, and it was said with a chuckle, the audience laughed, I laughed, we all laughed,” he added. “But they take it and they cut it, and then they cut it, and it says ‘I wanna be a dictator.’ These are very dishonest people that we’re dealing with. Very dishonest people. Bad people.”When the television personality — the host, not the candidate — asked whether the comments had been taken out of context, the former president replied, “All you have to do is watch it.” If Trump wants to relitigate the controversy, that’s fine, but he might not like where this ends up. The controversy began in early December 2023, during an on-air interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The host, a close ally to the former president, prompted Trump to say he wouldn’t abuse his powers, but the GOP candidate replied, “Except for Day One.” When the host seemed surprised, Trump added, while pointing to Hannity, “He’s going crazy. Except for Day One.”Offered an opportunity to explain himself, Trump suggested that he’d use dictatorial powers to “close the border” and approve increased oil drilling. When Hannity again tried to help his pal, the GOP frontrunner doubled down. “I love this guy,” Trump said, referring to Hannity. “He says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said: ‘No, no, no — other than Day One.’ We’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.” As the video of the exchange makes clear, the context doesn’t much help. Republican officials insisted soon after that the former president was kidding. That defense proved unsustainable: In the weeks that followed, Trump repeated the line over and over and over again.In other words, this wasn’t just a single “joke” in a single interview; the GOP candidate, on multiple occasions, spoke publicly about his intention to serve as a temporary American dictator. I can appreciate why the former president, months later, wants to downplay the significance of his own rhetoric, but Trump said what he was quoted saying.

Pennsylvania Senate candidate made a pretty bad geographical mistake,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/dave-mccormick-confuses-philadelphia-pennsylvania-mississippi-rcna168787,"Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick tried to stoke anti-immigrant vitriol on social media Wednesday — but faceplanted in the process. McCormick's campaign reposted a tweet from a right-wing account on X about an undocumented immigrant accused of a crime in Philadelphia, adding its own commentary blasting his opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for their supposed ""open border policies."" But the story was about Philadelphia, Mississippi -- not the City of Brotherly Love. Casey's team wasted no time, with spokeswoman Maddy McDaniel noting the mistake and adding a little snark to boot. McCormick's team deleted the tweet and shared another one in its place featuring news headlines framing immigrants as threats to Pennsylvania. But unfortunately for him, the flub managed to highlight his weak point. Like other Republican Senate candidates this year, he’s been called out for being uber-wealthy and spending ample time living outside the state where he’s running for office. McCormick rents and frequently visits a multimillion-dollar mansion in Connecticut, where he also ran a hedge fund. So the cop confusion — in addition to exposing his campaign's bigoted arguments — isn’t helping him beat the carpetbagger allegations."
Don’t fall for Mark Zuckerberg’s Trump-friendly suck-up,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/mark-zuckerberg-letter-jim-jordan-biden-administration-rcna168708,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg threw some red meat to the MAGA crowd on Tuesday. And based on some of the headlines alone, one could be forgiven for believing, at first glance, that Zuckerberg’s allegation of having been “repeatedly pressured” by the Biden administration to remove social media content that conservatives have obsessed over was, well, rooted in fact and principle rather than politics. That’s why I’ve appreciated the outlets that framed Zuckerberg’s letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan properly: as a rhetorical gift — or mere groveling — to Republicans at a key moment in a critical election. For context, Republicans have spent the past few years crowing about purported censorship and anti-conservative bias by the government and social media companies. And after all that time, including several House hearings and closed-door interviews, they’ve got nothing to show for it. In fact, all they’ve proved is that content moderation is a difficult task that is — and this is crucial — fundamentally left to social media companies to handle on their own. But Zuckerberg’s letter nonetheless aligned with conservatives’ claims. He showed contrition for not having been “more outspoken” about the “government pressure” he claims his companies faced from the White House in 2021 to remove certain content related to Covid-19, some of which he portrayed as “humor and satire.” But he then acknowledged that the decision about what content to allow was Meta’s, saying he feels strongly that his companies, including Facebook and Instagram, “should not compromise” their own standards. He also said that Meta shouldn’t have “demoted” a news story about the Biden family and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Republicans often point to this action as proof of anti-conservative bias, despite the fact that the guidance came from the Justice Department during the Trump administration — not exactly a bastion of liberalism. Zuckerberg also wrote that he won’t be making financial contributions toward boosting the country’s electoral infrastructure — as he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did in 2020 — in order to “be neutral.” Republicans have falsely said these grants unfairly aided Democrats, and Zuckerberg essentially cowed to them. But let’s keep it real: The Meta CEO has seemed far from “neutral” this election cycle. Zuckerberg has sucked up to Donald Trump, saying that seeing the former president “get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” He has made it harder to track the spread of misinformation on his platforms, and his company has also hired a former Project 2025 employee. Disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz wrote a great thread on X in which she made the case that Zuckerberg’s letter is all about self-preservation … and copying Elon Musk’s fealty to conservatives. Check out Jankowicz’s full thread here."
Trump’s online tantrum targets Harris with crude sexual remark,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 7:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-tantrum-kamala-harris-crude-sexual-remark-election-2024-rcna168793,"Even those who’ve grown accustomed to Donald Trump’s tantrums were taken aback by his latest online antics. An Associated Press report summarized: The former president’s timing could’ve been better. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released a new ad this week that argued, among other things, that Trump would seek revenge against his perceived foes in a prospective second term. It was against that backdrop that the Republican nominee used his social media platform to promote: But in case that wasn’t quite enough, a New York Times report highlighted what was arguably the most offensive item in the GOP candidate’s avalanche of ugly nonsense. The Times’ report added that the “repost was the second time in 10 days that the former president shared content from his personal account making sexually oriented attacks on Ms. Harris. Though he has a history of making crass insults about his opponents, the reposts signal Mr. Trump’s willingness to continue to shatter longstanding norms of political speech.” It’s worth emphasizing that in each of these instances, it wasn’t Trump who personally created the offensive online content. But that hardly makes the circumstances any better: The former president apparently saw these ugly messages and deemed them worthy of amplifying to his vast online audience. What’s more, his willingness to target Harris with a crude sexual remark dovetails with related rhetoric Fox News host Jesse Watters, who told viewers this week that the Democratic nominee, if elected, will “get paralyzed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her.” One of his co-hosts at the time, Jeanine Pirro, urged him to ""take it back."" (Watters denied that his remark was intended to suggest “anything of a sexual nature.”) Trump boasted this week that he’d be “great for women” if voters return him to the White House. There’s fresh evidence to the contrary."
Jim Jordan targets daughter of judge from Trump’s hush money case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 6:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-targets-daughter-judge-trumps-hush-money-case-rcna168760,"As Donald Trump’s recent criminal trial drew closer, the former president lashed out at a variety of people across the legal system, including likely witnesses in his hush-money-to-a-porn-star case. It led Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the proceedings, to impose a gag order on the Republican to help protect the integrity of the process. Trump, who has an affinity for going after the family members of his perceived foes, responded by going after the judge’s daughter — publicly and repeatedly. The GOP candidate’s allies, including House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Donald Trump Jr., soon followed down the same path. Four months later, the party is still at it. The Hill reported: As things stand, Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee’s far-right and conspiratorial chairman, wants the company’s CEO both to give a deposition and sign an affidavit that Authentic Campaigns was not in communication with Merchan. To be sure, to know the Ohio Republican is to know how irresponsible he is — I made the case last fall that Jordan is the single worst member of Congress — but even by his standards, these latest antics are tough to defend. The underlying conspiracy theory is that the judge in the Trump case might have somehow been in league with his daughter and her partisan campaign efforts. It’s a difficult idea to take seriously. As my MSNBC colleague Lisa Rubin explained, “The House Judiciary Committee has been told plainly that the digital strategy firm with which Judge Merchan’s daughter works has not done any work for the Biden or Harris campaigns this cycle and that she herself does not work with any relevant political clients. They’ve also been told about the death threats to her and the firm’s founder. Yet today, they subpoenaed the firm, as if it, as opposed to the committee or Trump himself, has engaged in misconduct.” What’s more, Authentic Campaigns’ founder, Mike Nellis, has explained to Jordan, in writing, “Authentic had no role, involvement, or influence whatsoever in those judicial proceedings,” Nellis wrote, claiming that his company has had no contracts with Biden for President, Harris for President or the Democratic National Committee since January 1, 2023. A report in The New Republic went on to note, “Nellis called Trump’s claims that Loren Merchan had raised tens of millions off of Trump’s trial ‘unequivocally false.’ He also lambasted the committee for ‘using valuable time and taxpayer dollars to perpetuate a false right-wing conspiracy theory,’ calling it a ‘disgraceful misuse of power.’” There’s no reason to believe this Republican crusade will end anytime soon, but it certainly should."
The Trump-Vance campaign is in (another) crisis of its own making,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/jd-vance-childless-women-teachers-insults-rcna168686,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 28 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is making headlines yet again after another one of his rants about childless women resurfaced. This time, Donald Trump’s running mate turned his ire to educators — attacking Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, during a Center for Christian Virtue leadership forum in 2021: Let me just say, as a person who has not birthed a child from my own womb, I take grave offense to these comments. I don’t know what children Vance himself has birthed — it’s my understanding that it was his wife who had the children — but it seems the senator just can’t help himself from opening his mouth and disparaging large swaths of the American public. Most Americans probably don’t agree with the idea that if you don’t have children, you don’t have a stake in this country’s future.  Obviously, this isn’t the first time Vance has attacked women without biological children and every time another one of these rants is unearthed, further damage is done to the Trump-Vance ticket.   This all goes back to the importance of vetting in a presidential campaign. I recently spoke to former Attorney General Eric Holder, who ran the vetting process for the Harris-Walz campaign. During that conversation, I asked him if he was sure his team got everything and that no stone was left unturned. Holder told me he combed through the internet and watched hours of videos of the top contenders.   So, I just have to wonder: What was the vetting process like for Vance? Because this is simply insane.

The former president, despite his awful record related to respecting U.S. troops and veterans, appeared eager on Monday to exploit the third anniversary of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghans. As a result, the Republican nominee attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was quickly followed by a thumbs-up photo-op at a gravestone in Section 60 of the cemetery, where many service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. At that point, the story was already problematic. On Tuesday, however, the matter took a turn for the worse amid reports of an “incident” involving Trump aides and someone who worked at the cemetery. A day later, the controversy continued to intensify. NBC News reported: Republicans might’ve hoped this scandal would be a one-day story. I have some bad news for them. It’s a story with a surprising number of moving parts, so let’s summarize where things stand. Where will the controversy go next? Watch this space."
A 12-foot statue of Rep. John Lewis stands where Confederate monument used to be,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 1:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/john-lewis-statue-confederate-monument-georgia-courthouse-rcna167027,"A bronze statue of the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis has been erected outside the DeKalb County Courthouse in Georgia, replacing a Confederate monument that stood there for 112 years. Standing 12 feet tall, the statue of Lewis was created by sculptor Basil Watson. It was installed on Friday and will be officially unveiled on Aug. 24. An obelisk commemorating the Confederacy had been on the site from 1908 to 2020. For years, the Beacon Hill Black Alliance for Human Rights, a local group advocating for Black residents in Decatur, had campaigned for the obelisk’s removal, but state law prevented the local government from doing so. In 2019, the group successfully pushed for a plaque to be placed nearby to provide context for the monument. The plaque read: As racial justice protests swept the country in 2020 and local governments and institutions in the South reassessed their tributes to the Confederacy, a DeKalb County judge ordered the obelisk’s removal, saying it had “become a public nuisance.” More than 100 Confederate monuments were removed that year, a study found. A task force created shortly after was assigned to oversee replacing the Confederate monument with one honoring Lewis. A leader of the Civil Rights Movement, Lewis represented the Atlanta area in the House from the time he was first elected in 1986. In an interview with The Washington Post one month before his death, he told Black Lives Matter protesters, “You must be able and prepared to give until you cannot give any more.” Lewis died in July 2020 at 80 years old after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, he was one of the most prominent members of the House and the longest-serving member of the Congressional Black Caucus."
JD Vance points to ‘Gangs of New York’ to back up claim that immigration leads to crime,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 11:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-gangs-of-new-york-deportation-crime-rcna167012,"Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, defended his past comments on immigration by pointing to the 2002 Martin Scorsese movie “Gangs of New York” as an example of immigration leading to higher crime rates. At a campaign appearance at the Milwaukee Police Association on Friday, Vance was asked about his comments in 2021 in which he claimed past waves of immigration led to increased crime, and if he thought mass deportations — a major part of the Trump-Vance campaign platform — would have addressed those issues. The Ohio senator responded by referencing the 2002 film in which an Irish man, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, exacts revenge for his father’s death by infiltrating a violent anti-immigrant gang in the mid-19th century. “Has anybody ever seen the movie ‘Gangs of New York’? That’s what I’m talking about,” Vance said. “We know that when we have these massive ethnic enclaves form in our country, it can sometimes lead to higher crime rates.” He later added: “What happens when you have massive amounts of illegal immigration, it actually starts to create ethnic conflict, it creates higher crime rates. We’ve certainly seen that over the last few years.” Vance’s reference to “Gangs of New York” as evidence for his racist assertion about immigrants calls into question his comprehension of the movie. As Washington Post columnist Philip Bump pointed out on X, “the most brutal, vicious killer in that movie is the nativist who loathes immigrants.” But Vance’s claim is wrong about the real world as well: A slew of studies have shown that there is no significant link between immigration and crime. In fact, research has repeatedly shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Michael Light, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has published a paper on the subject, told Reuters in April, “Of course, foreign-born individuals have committed crimes. But do foreign-born individuals commit crime at a disproportionately higher rate than native-born individuals? The answer is pretty conclusively no.” Yet cases of violent crime committed by migrants gain widespread national attention, in no small part due to fearmongering about migrants taking jobs from Americans and committing crimes — one of Trump’s long-standing claims. Vance has struggled greatly to boost Trump’s candidacy. Although many of his past remarks on women have led to particularly intense backlash as they resurface, Vance has also made several comments in recent weeks — including on Friday — that have done very little to help the situation or improve his popularity. Polls indicate that he has not made a good impression on Americans so far, with his unfavorable ratings increasing by more than 9% since he was chosen as the GOP nominee’s running mate."
House Oversight Chair James Comer opens investigation into Tim Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 9:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/james-comer-tim-walz-china-house-oversight-rcna167001,"After many failed attempts to advance their impeachment probe into President Joe Biden, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are shifting to a new target: Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz. Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., on Friday announced an investigation into Walz’s ties with China, asking FBI Director Christopher Wray for information about the Minnesota Democrat’s dealings with the country. Comer wrote in his letter: Comer also claimed that Walz has had “problematic engagement” with Chinese “entities” that is antithetical to the effort to “identify and defeat CCP unrestricted warfare against America.” A spokesperson for Walz told The Washington Post, “Republicans are twisting basic facts and desperately lying to distract from the Trump-Vance agenda: praising dictators, and sending American jobs to China.” Walz’s personal relationship to China is well-documented. He spent a year teaching English in Foshan in southern China, arriving shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre. For nearly a decade into the early 2000s, he and his wife, Gwen Walz, arranged educational visits to China for high school students. Walz has said that he’s traveled to the country around 30 times, including for his honeymoon. Yet Walz has taken positions that would not have endeared him to the Chinese government. As a member of Congress, he met with Tibetan leaders and Chinese dissidents, and he served on a congressional commission that tracks human rights abuses in China. In 2017, he co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act; Jeffrey Ngo, a senior policy and research fellow at the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, credited its passage years later to Walz’s early support. Despite interest from the Chinese public in Walz’s history with their country, some experts on Chinese politics have said it’s unlikely that the relationship between Washington, D.C., and Beijing would ease even if he and Harris take the White House. Still, Walz’s approach to U.S. relations with China is arguably more nuanced than many American politicians’. “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,” Walz said in a 2016 interview. As Donald Trump and his campaign struggle to find an effective point of attack against Walz, Republicans are seizing on an opportunity to portray the governor’s history with China as something suspicious. With the Oversight Committee’s investigation, Comer, who as committee chair has a history of partisan investigations into Trump opponents, now takes it up a notch."
I’m a cancer survivor. Nassau County’s mask ban is a threat to my life.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 7:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nassau-county-bans-masks-endangers-vulnerable-residents-rcna166981,"On Thursday, officials in Nassau County, New York, where I live, signed a mask ban into law, one of the first of its kind in the country. And while to most healthy adults it doesn’t mean much, to those with serious health conditions, like me, it makes getting out into the world a lot harder. The ban was touted by lawmakers as a public safety measure after reported antisemitic incidents and protests at various New York universities, many involving people wearing masks. Those who violate the new law face a misdemeanor charge punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. And while there are exemptions for people with religious and medical reasons, it’s not dealing with the law that I’m afraid of. It’s dealing with the “citizen cops” of the world who will be using their discretion to enforce it. I was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in February 2023. It’s a fast-growing type of blood cancer. I underwent more than five rounds of chemotherapy, and the following July, thanks to an amazingly generous donor, I had a stem cell transplant, something I knew nothing about until I got sick. I was given some of the most powerful chemotherapies to kill my old immune system and any remaining cancer cells. Then I was given my donor’s stem cells to help build a brand-new immune system. There are a lot of risks that come along with the transplant, especially in the early stages as the stem cells are engrafting and you have no immune system. The first 100 days are the riskiest, and you must watch everything from what you eat to how it’s prepared, and most of all the people around you. Your body is starting from scratch, so you have almost no immunities. Any vaccinations you’ve had over your lifetime have been wiped out. For the last year since my transplant, my immune system has slowly been getting stronger. But building a new immune system takes years, and I have a long way to go. So, wearing my face mask whenever I go out is essential. That brings me back to the new law. I wear a medic alert bracelet and would hope that showing it to the police, should it ever become an issue, would be enough. But that’s not guaranteed, because anyone can just order one. Would I be forced to show up in court to prove my medical condition to a judge? And what cost and time could that take, all to protect my health? And what about my family or people who act as caregivers, who don’t technically have medical conditions of their own, but still wear masks to protect me? Would there be an exemption for them? Most of all, I worry about those who have strong feelings against masks. As we know, many people read headlines and not always the full story. And just reading most of the headlines, all someone will know is that there’s a mask ban in Nassau County. Even at the height of my illness, with no hair and really looking like I had cancer, I still got comments like “Covid is over” or “that’s not protecting you.” And while the few comments hurt, especially while I was battling for my life, I could shake them off. I had a bigger fight ahead of me. Now, healthier with hair again and 43 years old, the comments continue. But I worry that in this current political climate and with the new law, it may not end at that. People can’t see my disability from the outside. It’s been hard to get back out in the world, as many can relate to after going through a global pandemic. Even being as careful as I am and just starting to let my guard down a little in outdoor settings, I caught Covid. And it took my body and immune system down hard. Luckily, I’m recovering and back to wearing my mask diligently, even outdoors. I want to be able to return to my normal life. And go out with friends, see a Broadway show, and one day get back to my office in the city. But now with New York City considering passing its own mask ban, I don’t know when I would feel safe enough to do that. Is this law really protecting the masses?"
University of Florida students expose ex-President Ben Sasse's alleged spending spree,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ben-sasse-university-of-florida-expenses-desantis-rcna166943,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 16 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Remember Ben Sasse? The Republican senator from Nebraska was first elected back in 2014. He made a show of not voting for Donald Trump in 2016 and fashioned himself as something of a Trump critic within the party.  Despite that, during his time in the Senate, he voted for the then-president’s agenda anyway — passing his tax cuts and voting to declare a “national emergency” so Trump could divert money from the military to build his border wall. Sasse voted against hearing from witnesses in Trump’s first impeachment and was among the 52 Republican senators who acquitted the ex-president. When he faced a primary challenge in 2020, Sasse even scored an endorsement from Trump, the man he once compared to the white supremacist David Duke. The senator went on to win re-election. But, less than two years into his second term, he resigned to take a job as president of the University of Florida. Then, in July, just 18 months after taking that job, Sasse announced his resignation. He cited his wife’s ongoing medical struggles, including a recent epilepsy diagnosis.  On Monday, the university’s student newspaper, The Independent Florida Alligator, published a report about Sasse’s short tenure as UF president.  According to documents obtained by the Alligator, which have not been seen or independently verified by NBC News, Sasse hired a number of his old Senate staffers and allies to highly paid positions at the university. Some even worked “remotely” from Washington, D.C.  The paper also reported that spending by the office of the president more than tripled during Sasse’s first year at the University of Florida. According to the Alligator, the school’s previous president, Kent Fuchs, spent $5.6 million during his final year with the university. In Sasse’s first year as president, he spent $17.3 million. Travel spending also reportedly skyrocketed under Sasse. Fuch’s yearly average travel spending was just $28,000. Sasse’s office spent more than 20x that amount, totaling $633,000 in his first fiscal year with the school. NBC News reached out to the University of Florida but has not heard back. The university told the Alligator that “Sasse’s budget expansion went through the ‘appropriate approval process.’” On Friday, in a statement posted to X, Sasse responded to the report, saying it was “not true” and that there was no “inappropriate spending"" during his time as president: The chief financial officer for the state of Florida has now called on the University of Florida to conduct an investigation into what he referred to as Sasse’s “exorbitant spending.” The DeSantis administration also says it’s been talking with the university’s leadership about it. “We take the stewardship of state funds very seriously and have already been in discussions with leadership at the university and with the (state university system’s) Board of Governors to look into the matter,” DeSantis spokesperson Bryan Griffin said in a statement.

Why Kamala Harris' DNC will be different,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-democratic-convention-different-rcna166960,"I spent the day in Chicago on Thursday at the United Center, where the Democratic National Convention will be held next week. And while there will still be lots of speeches and plenty of balloons, I can already tell the event is going to feel different from past conventions. Here are three examples: This November, Arizona voters will decide on a constitutional amendment known as Proposition 139 that would ensure abortion care access up until fetal viability, or around the 24th week of pregnancy. And the proposition already has a lot of support within the state. Over 577,000 signatures were collected to put it on the ballot, the most ever for an Arizona initiative. According to a CBS poll from May, 65% of likely Arizona voters already say they support abortion being kept legal in all or most cases. Proposition 139 could also have a big impact on voter turnout. As Donald Trump brags about overturning Roe, this initiative has the potential to energize Democratic voters, with consequences for the presidential race as well as Arizona’s pivotal Senate contest between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake. Moore has been a powerhouse in Democratic politics for decades. She served as the director of White House political affairs under President Bill Clinton, was a key adviser to Biden during the historic Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, and played a pivotal role in securing Harris’ spot on Biden’s 2020 ticket. Now, Moore is taking on another critical role: managing this year’s Democratic National Convention in her hometown. A Chicago native, Moore got her start in politics as an organizer for the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign. She later became a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. As chair of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Moore brings decades of experience and deep roots. My sit-down interview with her will air this Sunday. Best known for her role as Kate Harper, deputy national security advisor on “The West Wing,” Mary McCormack is an accomplished actor, producer and dedicated social justice advocate. Recently, she co-authored the book “What’s Next,” which she describes as “a love letter to The West Wing, the people behind it, and the fans who cherished it.” We’re thrilled to have her join us on the show this Sunday, alongside Martin Sheen. What show are you bingeing right now? “Veep” on HBO. What’s the last book you read? “Devil in White City” by Eric Larsen. What time do you wake up on the weekends? Too early. 7 a.m. How do you take your coffee? With a little bit of cream."
Elon Musk was right to tell E.U. regulators to buzz off,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-x-trump-eu-regulators-censorship-rcna166619,"At least a million people listened to Elon Musk’s conversation with former President Donald Trump live on X this past Monday. A private citizen engaging a powerful politician in a dialogue is a critical element of American free speech. Unlike most of the rest of the world, our system is built on the belief that more nonviolent speech — the good, the bad and the ugly — is the way we settle our differences and make decisions in our democracy. And whatever your politics, this is a good and normal thing — freedom is messy and such conversations are protected by the Constitution, no matter how truthful, misleading, hateful or valuable the conversation was to listeners. Americans should celebrate our expansive view of expression and encourage more of these conversations in our society. But that’s not how Thierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for internal markets felt. Prior to the interview, Breton sent Musk a letter (which he also posted on X) in which he felt “compelled to remind” Musk that large American tech companies are required to comply with a series of rules and regulations under the sprawling auspices of the Digital Services Act (DSA). Right after making a perfunctory aside to say that free expression is important, Breton warned that X is responsible for failing to take appropriate “mitigation measures … regarding the amplification of harmful content.” To be clear: “mitigation measures” means removing, demoting, limiting how content can be shared or searched for, or otherwise suppressing speech that “promotes hatred, disorder, incitement to violence, or certain instances of disinformation” as it is “considered illegal, according to national and/or EU law.” Breton essentially threatened X with legal action if it failed to censor the Trump conversation to the satisfaction of E.U. bureaucrats. This is a full-throated attack on free speech in an American election. While Musk has occasionally been an inconsistent champion of free speech rights, he was clearly right to move ahead with his interview. How American businesses react to European threats will shape how everyone engages with the online world in the future. It is worth reading Breton’s letter for yourself to understand just how dangerous and brazen this act of attempted censorship by the E.U. is. It’s also a helpful demonstration of how the edicts put out by authorities in Brussels don’t just stay in Europe — they can have major implications for how American tech companies operate, what kinds of speech are allowed online and even how election campaigns are run in the U.S. The E.U., via Breton, argued for the widespread suppression of a major American political discussion on X because they assert it may be illegal in E.U. member countries. While social media companies can and often do “geoblock” content so that it can’t be viewed in certain countries in response to legal demands from authorities, the idea that X users would not be able to tune in to a discussion with an American presidential candidate — because the E.U. says so — is more akin to the Great Firewall of China or other totalitarian efforts to limit what users can find online. But Breton did not stop there, as he helpfully reminded Musk that X is already being prosecuted under the DSA for not sufficiently following E.U. rules. And since this interview with Trump was livestreamed to users in the E.U., Brussels was “monitoring” for content that might “incite violence, hate, and racism.” Thus, “any negative impact of illegal content ... may be relevant in the context of the ongoing proceedings.” Nothing says “do what we want” quite like “and if you don’t, we will use it against you in our court of law where we are the judge, the jury, and the executioner and can penalize you by seizing up to 6% of your global sales.” U.S. citizens and American companies are increasingly affected by the rules written in Brussels — the so-called “Brussels effect.” Every company has to decide if their new product or new content moderation policy complies with a vast array of E.U. laws. Many companies will decide to simply create products and policies that comport with E.U. rules, even when offered to Americans. For example, the recent massive IT outage was so widespread in part because of an E.U. requirement that forced Microsoft to give CrowdStrike broad access to Windows. Other companies will deal with this through the costly complication of having significantly different products and business practices for different regions or by launching only some of their products in some locations. For example, in the past month, Meta and Apple both announced that they will not be releasing some of their new features in the E.U. because of concerns over the DSA. The censorial threat from Breton clearly extends the Brussels effect into American speech and elections. This is a demand from the E.U. to suppress core political speech regarding a U.S. election under penalty of law that could have major implications for Musk, X, Trump’s candidacy, American voters and Europeans who want to observe or be part of the conversation. It is worth remembering that such censorship is a double-edged sword. Consider this entirely plausible hypothetical: E.U. right-wing parties further build on their electoral gains and win a majority in the next E.U. election. They could easily turn the E.U.’s censorship arsenal against American progressives — issuing such warnings to social media companies when Democratic politicians speak online, declaring pro-Palestinian activists to be terrorists, or censoring pro-immigration groups as a threat to Europe. Rather than let American companies, users and expression be abused by E.U. diktats, the American government should be diplomatically pushing back to protect its citizens and their rights. And as evidenced by large tech companies already withholding their newest products from the E.U., it also may be only a matter of time before these companies simply walk away from Europe and its crippling and censorial regulations."

Why arresting Matthew Perry's alleged drug suppliers won't solve anything,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/matthew-perry-drug-charges-ketamine-death-rcna166959,"If you’ve ever seen a newborn bird or mouse, their skin is so thin it’s translucent. It’s difficult to imagine the vulnerability of such a creature, so new to the world. They need constant protection. Any exposure might kill them. When the drugs are gone, addicts have no skin. We are that vulnerable. Our eyes stay shut tight, as even the sunlight hurts. If Matthew Perry was like me, and I think he was, he couldn’t survive the world without help. He was just as vulnerable. As I read the contents of his toxicology report, I thought, He just hurt too much. We don’t feel vulnerable to drugs, but to feeling. We can’t stand it after being numb so long. On Thursday, news broke that five people, including Perry’s assistant and doctors, were charged with providing him the ketamine that led to his accidental overdose in 2023. “They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great danger to Mr. Perry,” proclaimed U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada. “But they did it anyways. In the end, these defendants were more interested in profiting off of Mr. Perry than caring for his well being.” It enraged me. I understand why charging these people may seem like a good idea. Text messages between two of the doctors indeed show a deep callousness toward Perry, whom they refer to as “a moron” as they speculate about their potential payday. But the false narratives surrounding addiction in our nation keep us sick. Arresting Perry’s suppliers is not a solution to addiction. It’s smoke and mirrors; a PR tactic meant to convince Americans our government is doing something about the problem. The truth is addiction is a terrible and mysterious disorder of the brain. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Heath Ledger, Prince, Whitney Houston and Matthew Perry did not survive it. Inexplicably, I did — so far. I’ve been off heroin for many years. But if I were to overdose tomorrow, the Drug Enforcement Administration would not be dispatched to investigate. I am not in the public eye and don’t have a fan base. Law enforcement doesn’t need to prove to anyone they’re doing something about my death. I’d be just one more statistic. I also can’t imagine any dealer considering a career change because of these arrests. The market for drugs is like any other, a question of supply and demand. If the five people who helped Perry procure drugs hadn’t come through, he would have found five others who would. He had the money to do so. Not everyone does. Addiction is a medical issue, not a moral one. What does “justice” look like? Arresting a doctor here or a personal assistant there? This sort of targeted prosecution is the flimsiest of Band-Aids. It implies the matter has been closed, and it enables society to bypass our responsibility — both to Perry and to each other. How do we convince the American people to invest in evidence-based drug treatments for addicts when other patients can’t get the basic health coverage they need? France cut heroin overdoses by almost 80%, a stunning success rate. But it has health care for all and centers devoted to not just getting addicts off drugs, but also to providing therapy and job training. There’s another aspect of this tragedy that is difficult to convey, and even more difficult to accept. And that is the notion of what is and isn’t help. I’ve been dope sick before, and it’s a hell I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Perry asked his longtime live-in assistant for relief; according to court documents, the assistant administered three injections of ketamine between 8:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on the day of the actor’s death. I can’t imagine Perry wanting that assistant punished for fulfilling his requests. (And of course, now we’ll never be able to ask.) I don’t expect everyone to understand an impulse that isn’t rational. But for addicts, help is often only one thing: more of what kills us. If we lived in a nation that recognized addiction as the disorder of the brain it is proven to be; if we provided medical support not just to addicts, but to all Americans; and if we finally gave up the yoke of puritanism and accepted the medical science surrounding addiction treatment, I might say: Go ahead. Arrest the dealers. But we do not live in such a nation. When our government cracked down on doctors for overprescribing with no other solutions in place, some addicts looked for relief on the streets. Some killed themselves. People in chronic pain were stranded. Illegal fentanyl killed hundreds of thousands. Should Kamala Harris become our next president, I hope she has the wherewithal to rewrite our addiction policy. In the meantime, the men and women who fed Perry’s addiction will go to jail — probably. Perry’s assistant has already pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death. The public’s thirst for revenge may be slaked temporarily. But nothing else will change."
Why Kimberly Cheatle’s journey from Secret Service director to protectee isn’t shocking,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 6:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kimberly-cheatle-protected-by-secret-service-rcna166980,"Tonight, NBC News’ Kelly O’Donnell reported that former U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has become U.S. Secret Service protectee Kimberly Cheatle. That’s because Cheatle, who resigned from her post on July 23, has become the target of unspecified, but presumably credible and significant, threats in the wake of the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and the Secret Service’s failure to prevent it. But as shocking as it is to see a former Secret Service director need the protection of her own former agency, it’s much less surprising when one considers the overall threat environment facing those whom Trump loyalists perceive as a danger to him — or them. After all, we learned earlier this week that the daughter of Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw Trump’s New York hush money trial, and her business partner have each been subjected to death threats and harassment, and that law enforcement has advised the daughter and her family to leave their home for their own safety. Further, in an interview with my NBC News colleague Ken Dilanian last month, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted that the Justice Department has brought 400 cases over the last two years alone dealing with threats against federal and state judges, federal and state prosecutors, federal and state legislators, and federal, state and local law enforcement officers. Of course, those are just the cases federal law enforcement has brought, not the totality of the threats. And several of those cases concern targeted people who, simply for doing their jobs, have raised Trump supporters’ ire. They become part of the online stew of conspiracy theories, misogyny, white supremacy and MAGA devotion that can catalyze grievances into threats — or worse. Take Spencer Gear, a 32-year-old Nevada man indicted last month. The Justice Department alleges that from November 2023 through July 2024, Gear made threats to injure or kill 11 federal or state officials, including five federal judges in Washington, D.C., and Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over both of E. Jean Carroll’s defamation trials against Trump. According to that indictment, Gear also directed threats, via a June 3 voicemail, at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the 34-count felony hush money case against Trump, as well as against Merchan. To be fair, neither the fact of Gear’s indictment nor the identities of his alleged targets is new. But the transcript of Gear’s bail hearing, which MSNBC has obtained, includes the government’s description of how resolute, methodical and unafraid those making the threats can be, even when warned by federal law enforcement, as officials say Gear was, that the types of messages he had been leaving for officials were not protected by the First Amendment. According to that transcript, prosecutors say days after a Manhattan jury returned its verdict in the hush money case, Gear left a voicemail message at Bragg’s Harlem office in which he claimed, “We’re at war now,” and then, referencing Bragg and Merchan, warned, “You’re dead men, we’re going to kill you ... we’re going to round you up, and we’re going to put you before our own court, and then we’re going to f---ing execute you.” Prosecutors played that voicemail for the court in arguing that Gear should not be free pending trial. Gear was equally bold even when the FBI came to arrest him, authorities say, initially refusing to leave his house and cutting his hand while throwing back a drone the agency flew into the house. By the time FBI was able to conduct a search, agents found not only “multiple firearms throughout the house,” but also a “tactical vest that had a significant amount of ammunition on it” and “fresh blood — as if he had been handling that tactical vest.” And although he left his home without violence, he told the FBI, “You can smile today because I chose a different path. You’re not the enemy, but you work for them. This organization is not constitutional. I hope you guys understand that.” We obviously don’t — and likely won’t — know the nature of the threats to Cheatle. But if even one of the people making those threats is as unrepentant and potentially prepared as authorities say Spencer Gear was, her rapid transformation from political appointee to guardee is perfectly understandable."
RFK Jr. clearly has something Trump wants,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-seems-desperate-rfk-jrs-endorsement-harris-care-less-rcna166949,"I’ve long wondered what erstwhile Democrat Robert F Kennedy Jr. — now an independent — is after with his MAGA-friendly presidential campaign. I’ve thought: “Does he simply want to help Donald Trump win? Does he want to seek retribution, alongside his antivax buddies, against liberals for daring to try to prevent mass death during the Covid pandemic?” A new report from The Washington Post seems to have landed on a rather simple answer: power and ambition.  Apparently, Kennedy, through an intermediary, sought a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to see if she’d be willing to offer him a role in her potential administration in exchange for his endorsement.  The Harris campaign’s response? Essentially: “boy, bye.” Per the Post:  Kennedy said in response to the report that he had reached out to all the candidates, but never asked the Harris campaign for a Cabinet position. As the Post noted, the cold shoulder Kennedy reportedly received from the Harris campaign was markedly different from the response he received from Trump’s campaign regarding a similar offer. Weeks earlier, Kennedy and Trump spoke directly about the idea of Kennedy endorsing Trump in exchange for a Cabinet position or advisory role in a potential Trump White House. Portions of one of their discussions were even posted online. And though no agreement seems to have been reached, the fact the chats occurred at all highlights a pretty clear contrast. Team Trump seems thirsty for Kennedy’s endorsement, or for him to leave the race at least, and Team Harris doesn’t seem to care either way. Recent polling data show why that may be. As my colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, Harris’ entry into the presidential race has attracted independent and third party voters who’d been considering Kennedy when President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee. On the other hand, Kennedy’s ongoing presence in the race only seems to hurt Trump. So even if they were to meet, Harris could reasonably ask Kennedy: “Why do I need your endorsement when your ‘supporters’ are already flocking to me?” Trump seems acutely aware that Kennedy’s campaign, which has been imploding as of late, seems to be pulling from his support. That would explain his public attack on conspiratorial podcaster Joe Rogan after Rogan praised Kennedy’s campaign. I’d argue all of this puts Kennedy in a prime position to extract some kind of concession from Trump down the line. He clearly has something Trump wants, whether that’s a suspension of his campaign or a full-on endorsement. And Trump has shown shameless deference to people willing who aid his campaign in any way."

Leaked videos show how Trump’s allies plan to equate abortion with murder,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 1:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-training-videos-abortion-trump-rcna166924,"The more that Donald Trump and his campaign try to distance themselves from the authoritarian ambitions of Project 2025, the more revelations emerge about how tightly linked they are. Videos of the Project’s Presidential Administration Academy, recently obtained by the investigative reporting outlet ProPublica, provide even more damning evidence of how former Trump administration officials plan to carry out their agenda in a possible second term — and how abortion is one of their key targets. ProPublica published 14 previously secret videos produced by the Heritage Foundation to train future administration appointees. Two of these videos in particular show that despite Trump’s gaslighting of the public that he has “moderated” on abortion, his Project 2025 allies are plotting multiple ways to attack it. Project 2025 lays out multiple anti-abortion plans, including revoking Food and Drug Administration approval of the abortion medication mifepristone and using the Comstock Act as a means of instituting a national abortion ban by criminally prosecuting the sale of abortion pills through the mail. These videos show how Trump’s allies also plan to radically reshape the federal government to elevate anti-abortion activists and even equate abortion with murder. In the section “Coalition Building,” Paul Teller, a former special assistant to the president and a senior aide in the Office of the Vice President, and Sarah Makin, a former deputy assistant to the president and former director of outreach in the Office of the Vice President, discuss the importance of building relationships with outside advocacy groups to advance the administration’s agenda, particularly on “pro-life” issues. Makin highlighted her role in planning a Rose Garden event during which Trump addressed the annual March for Life remotely. For optimal “optics,” she reached out to “an umbrella organization for pregnancy centers” to arrange a group of people to stand behind Trump. She lauded that “we had moms and their babies, babies who’d been rescued from abortion by these pregnancy centers come and stand behind the president.” (The comments start around the 11:15 mark.) Pregnancy centers, sometimes called crisis pregnancy centers, are “facilities that represent themselves as legitimate reproductive health care clinics providing care for pregnant people but actually aim to dissuade people from accessing certain types of reproductive health care, including abortion care and even contraceptive options,” according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. They often use “false and misleading information, emotional manipulation, and delays.” In the segment titled “Left-Wing Code Words and Language,” Katie Sullivan, former acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, and Bethany Kozma, deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration, devoted more than 45 minutes to vilifying Democratic programs to combat climate change, promote equity and advance LGBTQ and reproductive rights as a diabolical leftist plot to control peoples’ lives, akin to rule under Stalin or Hitler. The pair discussed their experiences as “part of a coordinated effort in the Trump administration focused on trying to take back hijacked language and definitions across the United States government.” The left, Kozma claimed, “got very creative years ago and started using different words to make abortion sound a little less like murder,” using instead phrases like sexual and reproductive health or reproductive rights. Sullivan added, “it’s incredible how the left is able to make killing children and babies a ‘pro’ movement."" Sullivan promised the video would teach trainees “how to identify the left’s progressive language,” “how to scrutinize career staff compositions for dangerous language,” and “how to combat their manipulative efforts, ensuring clarity of definition and conservative intention.” Sullivan also said that “you can do this in any role at any level of seniority.” Although Trump pandered to the anti-abortion movement during his first term, and stacked the Supreme Court with the conservative majority that overturned Roe, it’s clear he is now terrified that the Dobbs decision is an albatross around his neck — and that all the attention on Project 2025 is a perpetual reminder of his allies’ radical goals. Last month, Trump clumsily tried to claim in a Truth Social post, “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it” and “I have nothing to do with them.” But Trump can’t beat the truth with misdirection. At least 140 Project 2025 contributors, including those featured in the training videos, previously worked in his administration. In 2022, Trump flew to a Heritage Foundation conference on the organization’s private plane, with the organization’s president, Kevin Roberts, to deliver a speech. In the speech, Trump said, “They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.” Rolling Stone reported that just before publishing his bogus denial on Truth Social, “Trump had been privately — and very bitterly — complaining about the abortion policies laid out in the lengthy Project 2025 manifesto, and trashing the Project 2025-linked ‘lunatics’ who keep demanding unpopular abortion bans and restrictions.” Trump is keenly aware of polling data showing that, as public awareness of Project 2025 has skyrocketed, voters have recoiled from it. Trump can try to run, but he can’t hide from his closest allies’ plans to turn America into a dystopia where abortion is criminalized, and his loyalists wield power to police and censor even any discussion of it at the highest levels of government."
Oklahoma doesn't want to execute Richard Glossip. The Supreme Court might force it anyway.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 1:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/richard-glossip-execution-supreme-court-oklahoma-death-row-rcna166928,"A brief filed at the Supreme Court this week argues that a state court decision ordering an execution “was riddled with errors from start to finish.” Notably, that brief wasn’t filed by the death row prisoner, Richard Glossip, but by the state of Oklahoma, which, in a remarkable turn of events, is practically begging not to execute him. The state has admitted prosecutorial misconduct in keeping key evidence from the jury in securing Glossip’s conviction. But the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals didn’t think much of the government’s plea, instead reasoning in April of last year that the admission “cannot overcome the limitations on successive post-conviction review.”  Glossip, who has maintained his innocence, then asked the justices to stay to his execution. With the state supporting his request, the high court did so in May of last year. Yet, instead of summarily ordering a new trial like the state asked for — “so that justice can be done in this case,” the state said — the Supreme Court appointed a third party to defend the state court ruling. It’s not unprecedented for the court to appoint a third party to argue an abandoned position, but the implications of the justices potentially upholding the state court ruling here are extraordinary. “The [Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals] had no valid basis to order Oklahoma to execute Richard Glossip over the objection of the State’s chief law officer,” the state argued in its latest brief to the justices. In another notable feature of the case, Oklahoma is represented by top conservative Supreme Court lawyer Paul Clement, who’s also representing former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in his bid to move his Georgia state criminal charges to federal court.  “When the prosecution takes the extraordinary step of confessing error in criminal cases, courts are obliged to take the confession seriously, not apply procedural obstacles the State has waived,” Oklahoma’s brief said, adding: “That is particularly true in capital cases, and doubly so when the confessed error involves prosecutorial misconduct.” The oral argument is set for Oct. 9, during the first week of the court’s upcoming term. The hearing may provide a sense of where the court stands, ahead of a ruling expected by July 2025. In yet another noteworthy aspect of the dispute, Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case, presumably because he previously sat on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Oklahoma and thus some of Glossip’s prior litigation. While Gorsuch has sided with certain criminal defendants in cases where his Republican-appointed colleagues haven’t, he has routinely ruled against capital defendants.

Judge suspended after putting a teen in handcuffs for sleeping in court during a field trip,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/detroit-judge-teen-handcuffs-sleeping-kenneth-king-rcna166921,"A judge in Detroit has been suspended after he ordered a teenage girl to be handcuffed and threatened her with jail after she fell asleep in his courtroom during a field trip. District Court Judge Kenneth King was temporarily removed from the docket after an internal investigation and will “undergo the necessary training to address the underlying issues that contributed to this incident,” Chief Judge William McConico said in a statement Thursday. The 15-year-old girl was in King's courtroom Tuesday as part of a group trip organized by the Greening of Detroit, a local nonprofit organization, to help young people learn about the judicial process. A now-deleted YouTube video showed the girl falling asleep between hearings, when King yelled at her and ordered her to be put in handcuffs and to change into a Wayne County Jail jumpsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported. Colleen Robar, a representative for the Greening of Detroit, said in a statement Tuesday that the judge “chose to make an example of a 15-year-old girl in front of her peers,” calling his punishment “unacceptable.” The girl’s mother told NBC News that her daughter was tired because they don’t have permanent housing and that they had arrived late at the place they were staying the night before the trip. She told the Free Press: “My daughter is hurt. She is feeling scared.”  King’s excessively punitive reaction to the teen falling asleep has been widely condemned. He told WXYZ-TV on Tuesday that he was not so much “disturbed” by her falling asleep but by her “whole attitude and her whole disposition.” “That’s not something that normally happens. But I felt compelled to do it because I didn’t like the child’s attitude,” King told the local outlet. “I haven’t been disrespected like that in a very long time.”"
Trump's New Jersey news conference was just another act of self-sabotage,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 11:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-economy-message-republicans-inflation-rcna166935,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 15 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" On Thursday, Donald Trump held a news conference at his New Jersey golf club. The event was somewhat of a do-over for Trump's 90-minute rambling speech in North Carolina on Wednesday, where he was supposed to tout his economic proposals. The campaign did its best to set the scene — laying out a spread of groceries and posters claiming to show the “Price Increases since Kamala Harris took office.” That was the message Republicans and aides wanted Trump to stick to. Instead, what you saw was a man who is incapable and completely uninterested in staying on message.  It was Trump being Trump. It wasn’t as much a news conference as it was a rambling stream of grievances, insults, fabrications and gibberish. And that’s pretty much all we’ve gotten from Trump over the last few weeks. I don’t see any indication that’s going to change. The campaign is trying desperately to make him talk about the economy but Trump just can’t bring himself to do it. It's also worth noting that, for a guy who’s supposed to be a successful businessman, his ignorance of basic economics is kind of jaw-dropping. I’m interested to hear, whether on the record or off the record, the reaction from Republicans. I wonder if they saw that performance Thursday and thought: What are we going to do with this guy? Do we really want to put him back in the Oval Office? Where is he taking us?  Well, I think that’s pretty clear by now."
"To scare voters, Trump is making up claims about migrants finding jobs",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 11:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-immigration-rhetoric-crime-rcna166930,"Donald Trump held another meandering press event on Thursday, filled with all kinds of dubious claims.  One claim that's earned him particular criticism was his allegation that more than 100 percent of new job creation has gone to immigrants. That immigrants are purportedly siphoning jobs away from nonimmigrant Americans — which is demonstrably false, by the way — has become a common refrain in his 2024 campaign. The latest iteration was outlandish, even by his standards: Journalists have already debunked right-wing misinformation attributing job growth under the Biden administration entirely to immigrants getting jobs. Mathematically, though, Trump's statement is not even possible — another sign of Trump’s ongoing struggle with grade school-level concepts. And it’s also a sign of desperation. Trump launched his political career with a speech full of bigoted lies about immigrants — whom he painted broadly as rapists and ne’er-do-wells — being sent to the United States. I'd argue his racist and xenophobic portrayals of immigrants have gotten even more surreal since then, particularly in the current election cycle. This year, Trump has called migrants “animals” and “not people” in speeches, accusing them of ""poisoning the blood of our country.” In recent speeches, he’s routinely referred to serial killer Hannibal Lecter, attempting to associate the fictional character — who was held in a mental asylum — with immigrants who seek asylum in the U.S. So his made-up stat about immigrants somehow accounting for more than 100 percent of job growth is yet another tale he’s telling to sow fear and hate toward immigrants.  It’s noteworthy that Trump’s increasingly dehumanizing xenophobia comes as actual data about immigration and crime also shows him to be increasingly wrong. Border crossings decreased for the fifth consecutive month in July, reaching the lowest level recorded since fall of 2020, when Trump was president. In fact, the number of border crossings has been so low that NBC News reports Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has struggled to find enough immigrants to use in his cruel publicity stunt of busing asylum-seekers across the country. And violent crime, which Trump associates with immigration — despite data that shows immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born citizens — has declined at ""historic"" rates under the Biden-Harris administration.  This data exposes how Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric has been increasingly disconnected from reality of late. The facts simply aren’t on Trump’s side when it comes to the nightmarish scenes he paints for the public. To quote Trump-aligned rapper French Montana, “when the hate don’t work, they start telling lies.”"
This tech founder launched an elite VC firm after being told venture capital was ‘a young man’s game’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 11:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/tech-founder-launched-elite-vc-firm-told-venture-capital-was-young-man-rcna166934,"If you ask Silicon Valley tech veteran Miriam Rivera about the greatest influence on her path to success, the answer might surprise you: “Sesame Street.” Born to Puerto Rican parents in upstate New York, Rivera relied on Headstart and the iconic PBS show to learn English. “I spoke Spanish first,” she told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. “Sesame Street was really one of the ways that my parents helped me learn English and get ready for school.” Today, she sits on the Sesame’s board of directors, but that’s not her primary job. After receiving a JD-MBA from Stanford University, Rivera joined Google in 2001 as the tech giant’s second attorney, moving up the ranks as vice president and deputy general counsel before leaving in 2006. Now, she is the cofounder and CEO of Ulu Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm that specializes in early-stage investment of startups that might appear to be longshots but are ultimately very profitable. Rivera, 60, made Forbes and Know Your Value’s 4th annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list this month, for her accomplishments in the investment category. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. Since she founded the VC firm in 2008 with her husband Clint Korver, Ulu Ventures has consistently punched above its weight, managing $400 million in assets with a portfolio that includes ten current or recently-exited unicorns, including data startup Palantir, Guild Education, and fintech company, SoFi. They key to the firm’s success — and its primary focus — has been strategically funding founders from underrepresented backgrounds. “We did that by identifying talented people who were trying to pursue really big markets and also many of them want to do something that supports a positive social end,” Rivera told McGrath. “We looked particularly for teams that had diverse members, because there’s a lot of data that showed in public companies, diverse board members could actually generate greater profitability, and that’s what has turned out over the last 15 years to also be true of startup companies.” Rivera’s intuitive investment philosophy stems from her own family’s journey, watching her mother and father build a life from scratch. “My parents started off as migrant farmworkers, they moved from Puerto Rico to Florida, then they would work the crops between Florida and New York State,” she told McGrath. “A lot of the times lawyers have the worst hours of anyone … they say that they’re even worse than doctors these days. And my sense of that is nobody really works as hard as migrant farmworkers — so I knew that I was really blessed to be able to do the kind of work that I have done, both as an attorney and as a venture capitalist.” Rivera’s goal of seeding underdog startups and turning them into unicorns speaks to the persistent underrepresentation of women, especially women of color, in venture capital, where women-led companies still only receive about 2 percent of VC dollars. “Obviously women represent over 50 percent of the population [and] over 60 percent of the educated population in the United States,” she said. “That’s an example of how extreme the change is needed in terms of trying to increase representation in business. And it’s not going to happen with people who are opposed to investing in the most educated and the best.” It’s a bias Rivera knows all too well on her path to becoming a VC founder. “When I first started to raise capital for Ulu Ventures, I asked an experienced venture capitalist for a referral to a limited partner, which is an investor who invests professionally in venture firms,” she told McGrath. “And he told me that venture capital was a young man’s game — I was really left astounded because I’d served on a board with this person, but he dismissed me out of hand.” It wasn’t the first time Rivera overcame bias. Years earlier, she experienced similar discrimination as a new mother when she cofounder her first company. “I had my daughter on Friday, I went back to work on Monday, and a few months later I was told that by a director, if it were his grandchild, he’d prefer the mother to stay home,” she recalled. “I was asked to leave my firm and that’s partly because a new set of venture capitalists were coming in, and they did not want a husband-wife team — my husband and I were cofounders at the time of this startup — I certainly felt that it was a bias against working women, and certainly marital status bias.” Today, her resilience and persistence has paid off. Ulu Ventures is one of the largest, if not the largest, Latina-led firms in the country. Rivera considers the company her greatest over 50 achievement and has this to advice for women looking to succeed in the industry. “I think it’s really important for people to identify a place where they will be given a fair shot, and to find the right investors and the right supporters,” she said. “If you don’t do that, I don’t think you can build a great career.”"

Mary McCord: Although I could do without the heat, honestly, so that’s the only good thing. Andrew Weissmann: So I’m in the mountains where it’s in the 50s at night and it’s in the 70s during the day. And this is like a hill station where pre-air conditioning people would come up here to cool off. And you know what? It works. Mary McCord: Yeah, I’m surprised it still works though, because a lot of places that don’t have air conditioning are now realizing that doesn’t work anymore. Well, I’m the opposite. I’m in North Carolina on Topsail Island. Actually, today is pretty temperate, but it has been hot. Andrew Weissmann: So I don’t think we’ve mentioned who we are. So if you are a new listener -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- which we love to “Prosecuting Donald Trump,” I am Andrew Weissmann and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Mary McCord: Good morning. Andrew Weissmann: So before we get started, I wanted to mention to people something that we at “Prosecuting Donald Trump” and the fabulous team here started actually this past Monday, is that there is a new way to listen to our podcast. If you want ad free listening, you can always get the existing weekly Prosecuting Donald Trump podcast for free. So don’t worry about that. But MSNBC, they’re rolling out this special subscription offering on Apple Podcasts.

And you’ll also get the same thing with respect to other MSNBC original podcasts like “How to Win” and “Why Is This Happening?” And you’ll also get those podcasts ad free. Mary McCord: And speaking of all of that, we have a new bonus episode that is out and available now. I think it came out yesterday for premium subscribers. And in that new bonus episode, which we recorded last week, my colleague at Georgetown Law, Steve Vladeck, and a real constitutional law expert and Supreme Court expert, perhaps more importantly, he joined us to talk about President Biden’s proposed Supreme Court reforms, as well as just other issues having to do with Supreme Court reform. Andrew Weissmann: So if you’re interested, consider subscribing to MSNBC Premium. That’s what it’s called, MSNBC Premium on Apple Podcasts right from your phone or whatever device you’re listening on, so you don’t miss anything. So, Mary, what are we going to talk about today for free? Mary McCord: Right. That’s right. We have really a potpourri today. I mean, we are going to start off with the biggest news probably since last week, which was Jack Smith filing in the January 6th case in D.C., filing a motion to extend the time to file that joint status report, which would have been due last Friday, August the 9th, and saying, we need more time to propose the court’s next steps. And we’ll talk a little bit about the ramifications of that, why that might have happened, et cetera. And then we’ll kind of hit everything else going on. We have got a change in the schedule in the Manhattan case due to Mr. Trump filing a second renewed recusal motion with Judge Merchan and Judge Merchan rejiggering some of the scheduling to accommodate ruling on that before he rules on a motion to just overturn the verdict or vacate the verdict of the jury based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. We’ll give a slight update in what’s going on in Georgia and also the Florida appeal schedule. And then we’re going to get to listener questions again. So that’ll be quite amazing, two weeks in a row to hit some listener questions, and hopefully we’ll be able to keep doing that for a while. Andrew Weissmann: I love it. So should we turn first to the Jack Smith filing? It was a joint filing. In other words, both sides agreed to it, but it clearly was the impetus was Jack Smith saying, I need three more weeks, and the judge granted that. So the schedule got put off. And I thought it might be a good thing to start with what exactly Jack Smith said, because it is useful to start with what is the stated reason? Because knowing these people, like don’t think too hard. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: They give the reason. They tell the judge a couple of things that I found really interesting. They said, just to be clear, the special counsel is a part of the Department of Justice and that means that the Department of Justice has equities and can weigh in and that the special counsel has to consult with various other parts of the department. In this situation, it’s about the Supreme Court immunity decision, which has huge ramifications for all sorts of parts of the department, the criminal division, the national security division, the tax division, the environmental division. Mary McCord: Civil rights division. I mean, one of the charged crimes is a civil rights crime. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Civil rights and the civil division. I mean, there’s a number of parts of the department, and they just said that is a process that we have got to engage in. A little note to self is, although this is coming in the D.C. case, it kind of is like a backhanded swipe and reminder to how wrong Judge Cannon is, because it’s saying the special counsel, you might think that we’re totally independent and as she wrote, a private actor who’s been given these powers. And this basically says, we’re not a private actor. We’re embedded in the Department of Justice. I have to say, I’ve said this repeatedly, but when I was in Special Counsel Mueller’s team, I’ve never been more compliant with all of the DOJ rules. And we could not bring, as we talked about before, Mary. I would have needed your permission to bring national security division charges, the Foreign Agents Registration Act charges. We needed tax division authority. So he basically said, we just need time for that consultation process to be completed and that should take three weeks. Donald Trump, of course, agreed because it’s delay. I should also point out just so people understand, Jack Smith, this is, I think, the first time he has actually sought a delay and I think almost any case. I mean, he has been very, very sort of pressing and opposing delays in all sorts of cases. And so with a joint application like this, Judge Chutkan, it was not surprising that she would grant it. Mary McCord: Right. And in fact, what she did is she granted, and this was the request, that the joint status report that was supposed to be due August 9th is now due August 30th. That was the date proposed by Jack Smith, again, in a joint filing. So Mr. Trump’s attorneys agreed to that. And the status conference that was scheduled for August 16th, which would be this Friday, this is where we had expected that she would actually then talk to the parties about their filing that was due last Friday, originally due last Friday. That has now been postponed till September 5th. You may recall as well that when she required the parties to file a joint status report agreeing to things, if possible, on August 9th, she said, you know, you can note any disagreements. And we kind of chuckled about that last week, thinking, oh, you think there’ll be any disagreements? Because there’s been almost always disagreements between the special counsel’s team and Mr. Trump’s team when it’s come to both scheduling and substance, I’d say, but they were able to agree, obviously, on this motion for an extension. So the same thing would apply when they do file on August 30th. Again, if there are disagreements about what is going to happen going forward. Remember, this is the proposal for how should Judge Chutkan implement the Supreme Court’s immunity decision? How should she decide what’s official and what’s unofficial other than the one thing that the Supreme Court already told her was official and absolutely immune, and that is Mr. Trump’s communications with his own Department of Justice while he was the president. Everything else is up to her to make decisions about. And so, she needs kind of a plan of action. Are we going to have legal briefings? Are we going to have a factual evidentiary hearing or what some people have called a mini trial? And then if we’re doing all those things, what are going to be the dates for those things? So you can imagine that there could be disagreements about not only the approach in terms of legal briefs, factual development, but also the dates. And I can tell you right now, I suspect that Mr. Trump, even if things had not been put off the way they now have been for three weeks, would be arguing that there should be no evidentiary hearing at all before the election because it’s just getting too close to the election. So we will see. And then she will take these things up now on September 5th and either make a scheduling order on September 5th or someday after that, after she hears from the parties. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. And it’ll be interesting, as we’ve noted, whether Donald Trump says, in addition, that there are legal issues that should be decided sort of unrelated for the immunity. Mary McCord: Before the fact. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yes, hundred percent. Andrew Weissmann: Such as the appointment of the special counsel, the issue that Judge Cannon ruled on, as we pointed out, the D.C. Circuit has already ruled on that, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t sort of anticipate this heading up to the Supreme Court as a reason for further delay. The other thing I would keep an eye out for is as we get closer and closer to the election, there’ll be more warranted pressure on the department not to be taking action that could be viewed as political or influencing the election. It’s the so-called 60 or 90 day rule of the department. But what I’m keeping my eye out for is something that Jack Smith said about a month or so ago, which is that there’s nothing that really precludes him from continuing post-election and pre-January 20th from going forward. So I’m going to be interested, depending on what happens in the election, particularly if Kamala Harris were to win, the idea of having the judge at least tentatively schedule something during that interim period. In other words, post-election, but pre-January 20th, so that time period isn’t lost. Obviously, it is a much more precarious thing to take that position if Donald Trump were to win the presidential election, because that’s the period where he would be in a transition and there’s a lot of work to do. And so I think it would be hard-pressed for the court to necessarily go forward with that. I don’t know what you were thinking or what you’re sort of looking for, Mary. Mary McCord: Well, I agree. I think if Trump were to win, it would just be really tough to see the department, you know, going hard and fast to try to get things done before inauguration. And I actually don’t think it could all get done before the inauguration anyway, I mean -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. That’s a practical matter. Mary McCord: -- as a practical matter, very little could get done. And I think, you know, I think there’s a sequencing here, too, because before you can get to it, assuming there’s some aspect of proceedings now that might require factual development. Remember, the Supreme Court said in the immunity decision that with respect to two areas of conduct for which Mr. Trump is charged, there is some factual development required. And that has to do with the pressure on state legislators and state legislatures to basically support the alternate or fraudulent slate of electors for Mr. Trump, who was not certified the victor in those swing states. That pressure on them required some factual development. And also the January 6th events themselves that involved the rally at the Ellipse, really Mr. Trump calling on his supporters to march on the Capitol, calling on them to pressure Mike Pence to count the false electoral slates. All of that, the court said, require some factual development. But there’s still some sequencing here because one part of the Supreme Court’s decision was even for unofficial acts, let’s assume that that fraudulent elector scheme and the allegations regarding January 6th itself are unofficial. Let’s assume Judge Chutkan can determine that. The court, of course, ruled that you can’t use official act evidence to prove unofficial acts. So in terms of the briefing that has to still happen, I think there’s going to be a lot of argument not only about legally what’s official and unofficial for purposes of Mr. Trump being charged with those things, but then there’s going to be a lot of argument about what can even be admitted as evidence with respect to even things that there’s a better argument are unofficial. So it is complicated and I do think that’s also probably part of the delay. I mean, I realize they had something like close to 40 days to come up with a proposal about how to go forward, but I do think that part is also complicated. Most of the reason, though, like you said, Andrew, was what was stated in the motion. The government continues to assess the new precedent set forth last month in the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. United States. And that’s where you and I have been there. And I would say also, in my view, it’s not just the consultation with Criminal Division and Civil Rights and National Security and Civil and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and the Office of the Attorney General. But also my guess is that you could have some internal disputes between the trial team that may be wanting to go faster and the department leadership that is concerned about all these other equities and the precedent they’re establishing and how things that might get decided in this case will impact, which is part of the consultation, which will implicate things like the Civil Rights Division enforcement of civil rights laws like the one that Mr. Trump is charged with, conspiracy to violate voters’ civil rights by overturning the will of the voters. And it’s not uncommon in my experience, back when I was at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, before I went to main Justice, that on those cases where we did have to run things up the flagpole and consult at the highest levels, trial prosecutors are oftentimes pushing to go faster and harder than some of the leadership components in main Justice. I don’t know if that’s your experience, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: Totally. One thousand percent agree. Is it time for an anecdote? Mary McCord: Yes, absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: I was the chief of the criminal division in the Eastern District of New York. Mary, I know you were the chief of the criminal division in D.C. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So one of the things you do is you field lots and lots of intractable problems. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: But there was an ongoing trial. They were in the middle of jury selection and an interesting legal issue came up and the trial team came to my office and it raised a really interesting issue that the judge had raised. And we brought in a very senior, very experienced appellate lawyer into the conversation. She was relatively new to the office, not new to doing appellate work. And so we’re debating this and we’re trying to figure out a way forward. And she said, well, this is great. We’ll research it and we can get back to you in three weeks. And I -- three weeks. Mary McCord: How about tomorrow morning? Andrew Weissmann: No, I was like, we have about three minutes. The trial team is here on a break at lunch. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: They’re going back to court with a jury and a judge who need the answer now. And the appellate lawyer was looking at me like I had like seven heads. And I was like, no, no, no, no, no. Sometimes the necessity to just make a decision -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- is just there. Mary McCord: That is supportable based on your legal training, but maybe you haven’t fully, fully researched, yes. Andrew Weissmann: I used to say at times when I was there, when I was at the head of the criminal division in the Eastern District of New York, it was true when I was at the FBI, whereas the general counsel, sometimes you can get time and it’s important to remember that. But other times it’s the best decision you can make in eight minutes. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: You had 30,000 employees. You had ongoing searches in the field. People had imminent questions. And sometimes you just have to make an answer and have to give a decision. This is one where you could ask for more time and they did. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And there are those important equities. However, I have to say, Mary, I have been the beneficiary in my life of wonderful supervisors. And when Robert Mueller was the head of the FBI, he would, where he saw the need for a decision, he would say, okay, we are going to have a decision on X date. Mary McCord: X date, yes. Andrew Weissmann: And you’re going to plan your lives accordingly, backwards from that. And so, especially with the department where it can be very cumbersome and it’s like moving an oil tanker -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and it’s not as nimble as a little speed boat. It takes somebody like the Bob Mueller approach of stop playing with your food. That was one of his standard -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- phrases to drive something forward. So anyway. Mary McCord: I’m going to stick up for some appellate people because, you know, I was deputy chief appellate before I was chief of criminal. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: And I called my day job being the person to consult with the people in trial and I would drop everything when they would call from trial. And then my night job was actually doing our appellate work. So that was my day. Andrew Weissmann: And, yes, there is nothing better than an appellate lawyer who gets it and can really help you make those decisions that are kind of on the fly and have that deep knowledge. Anyway, Mary. Mary McCord: So, before we break, I do want to say another thing that I at least think that the Department of Justice should be considering, and that is going ahead and indicting the unindicted co-conspirators. As listeners may remember, the indictment charging Donald Trump charges six other co-conspirators, unnamed, but we can fairly easily determine who they are just from the descriptions of them, such as an attorney who spread false claims about election fraud, Rudy Giuliani, an attorney who developed a plan to use Mike Pence to overturn the election results, John Eastman, et cetera. They were not actually indicted. But when you actually call somebody an unindicted co-conspirator, as opposed to just not using that term, when you use that in an indictment, that means the department thinks there is evidence that would support an indictment or else you would not call them a co-conspirator. Andrew Weissmann: Although not necessarily proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Mary McCord: That’s right. Nope, nope, nope. Andrew Weissmann: It could just be by preponderance. Mary McCord: An indictment is about probable cause anyway, right? My point is they’re cautious, wouldn’t you agree, in using that term, unindicted co-conspirator? Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Mary McCord: And so as this case is definitely not going to trial anytime soon, to my mind, it would make sense to consider going ahead and bringing charges against everyone just for purposes of accountability and because things are going to take longer now than they maybe otherwise would have if we hadn’t had this detour to the Supreme Court. And all of that, though, also is going to depend in many ways on the results of the election, because just as we’ve discussed before, that if Mr. Trump wins, he can order his Department of Justice to dismiss the case against him. He can also order it dismissed against others and has, you know, essentially already suggested he would do that with respect to some of the January 6th attackers, also has dangled pardons. So whether this case moves forward depends on a lot of things beyond even just with the legal briefing and factual development in district court lead to. Andrew Weissmann: Well, as you know, Mary, I violently agree with you, but that’s a great segue. So we’re going to take a break, but that’s the reason it’s a good segue is because we’re going to talk about the schedule in New York, in Florida, but in Georgia as well, where there is a big overlap between those federal unindicted co-conspirators and the state Georgia case where those people are indicted defendants. But there’s a precarious position of that case as we’ll get to right after the break. So stay tuned. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. You know, one thing we didn’t just talk about in this sort of opening segment was comments by the current Democratic presidential candidate now. You know, the appropriateness or inappropriateness of commenting on any of these criminal prosecutions. We know that President Biden, generally speaking, with only a few sort of like very small comments, avoided it. And that’s what we’re seeing with Vice President Harris right now, too. In fact, I think we’ve now seen at least, I think, two examples, maybe more of her being at a rally and having people in the crowd start to say something like, lock him up, lock him up. And she has really shut that down. She said, that’s for the courts, right? We’re here to win an election in November. And Andrew and I just thought it would be appropriate to talk for a minute about why that is, why she doesn’t talk more directly about the pending criminal cases. Andrew Weissmann: Sure. And I thought this is important for people because they obviously could look at Donald Trump and his example and be like, well, why isn’t she doing it? Now, that kind of answers itself. Mary McCord: Right, it does. Andrew Weissmann: But it goes back to what you said about President Biden. When he was running and then when he took office, he was very much saying the White House stays out of who gets prosecuted, who doesn’t get prosecuted and commenting on pending criminal matters. If anything, if you were to talk about them, you can jeopardize that criminal matter. It can be raised by the defense in the criminal case to the judge as to why it’s unfair, why there’s bias, why there’s undue pressure on the prosecutors. And so it’s both sort of practical, but also it’s a different philosophy as to how the White House should be and should not be involved. And remember, Vice President Harris is the vice president. So she is at the head of the White House, but for one person. And so she is acting accordingly. And so what you will see is I think she is being very careful about talking about matters that have concluded, where there has been a jury finding or a judge’s finding. So she will talk about a finding of sexual assault. She will talk about a finding of fraud. She will talk about a finding of student fraud. So things that have been found and concluded where she’s not weighing in on a pending matter. And with respect to the pending matters, so the January 6th case, the Georgia case, the Mar-a-Lago case, you do not see her doing that. You see her saying, as you said, Mary, you know what, we’re going to let the courts deal with that. Our job is beating him at the ballot box. And without getting into who you should vote for, which, you know, Mary, you and I really try to studiously avoid. Obviously, we have our views and we have what we think are principles. I think it’s important to note that from our training as former DOJ people, it’s really understandable and it’s more consistent with what we understand to be the proper role of the White House officials in dealing with pending matters. Is that sort of fair in your take as well? Mary McCord: Oh, yes. And part of that is, again, you know, that independence between the Department of Justice and the White House is critical for people to have faith in the prosecutions that the department brings. And it’s something that Donald Trump has tried to eviscerate both by his own wanting to influence, if he’s elected again, the Department of Justice, not influence, but direct it outright. But also his accusations that this current Department of Justice has been weaponized against him and against the J6 attackers and others. And so all the more reason it’s important to keep that separation. But again, this is not constitutionally required. The president is the head of the executive branch. You know, right now, President Biden could direct Merrick Garland to do various prosecutions against various people and drop others. But we, you know, historically and as a matter of norms and adherence to the rule of law and wanting to have the population feel comfortable and that they can rely on the integrity of our governmental institutions, that hasn’t happened. And that includes political commentary during a campaign, not using current ongoing prosecutions as part of that. Now, I want to also note people might have said, well, wait, I thought Mar-a-Lago was dismissed. You called it pending. Well, it’s pending because it’s pending appeal. And in fact, that’s one of the dates coming up. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: The government’s brief in its appeal of Judge Cannon’s dismissal of the Mar-a-Lago case on the grounds that Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed, that brief is due August 27th so we will be able to talk about it in a couple of weeks. Andrew Weissmann: Do you want to briefly talk about the Georgia schedule and what happened there? And then we can go to Manhattan where there’s more to talk about. Mary McCord: Sure. So folks probably know that the Georgia, Fani Willis, that is a state prosecution of Mr. Trump and so many co-conspirators for RICO violations, state law RICO violations, as well as many, many other alleged crimes. That case has been on hold now for many months and it’s on hold pending an appeal by defendants there, Mike Roman, but others have joined that, of the trial court’s not to disqualify Fani Willis on the grounds of an actual conflict. And that was based on her relationship with the special attorney, special prosecutor she had appointed, Nathan Wade. The trial court there found there was no actual conflict of interest, but did find that there was an appearance of impropriety and therefore ordered Fani Willis to either get off of the case, she and her entire team, or Nathan Wade to get off of the case. He promptly resigned and that is what is up on appeal. The argument is being made that actually the trial court judge erred there and should have found an actual conflict, or even if he just found impropriety, should have ordered her disqualified, and that’s what’s currently being briefed. Ms. Willis filed her response just in the last week. It’s a lengthy response. It goes back through the trial court’s factual findings. And, you know, listeners may remember, in terms of whether there was any actual conflict, some of this had to do with when the relationship started, that romantic relationship started. Was it before she appointed him or was it after she appointed him? That was left unresolved by the trial court. But he did find that there really wasn’t any evidence of an actual conflict that she had hired him for her own financial gain, which again goes back, for those who need the reminder, because we have so many cases, was based on these trips that they took together and whether he had paid for them and she had benefited because she was getting to go places like Aruba and Bahamas, et cetera. And the trial court essentially found there was a lot of splitting of expenses here. She paid for some things. He paid for some things. She reimbursed him for certain things. And so there’s no actual conflict. It’s kind of sad to me that this dispute is what is delaying this case on the merits, right? We’ve got important and significant accusations here and whether, you know, each defendant is entitled to due process of law. But this is a very lengthy delay and I believe the appellate court is not actually going to hear it until December, hear argument until December. Andrew Weissmann: I agree with you. I mean, it makes our judicial system compared to other nations look like a laughingstock. The idea as to whether they went Dutch -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- completely 100 percent, that that issue is going to delay holding people legally accountable one way or the other, just to be clear -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- in connection with election interference, in connection with the presidential election, it made it really, I hate to be so flippant, it’s a joke -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- that that would be the issue. Mary McCord: Because when you think about it, Andrew, if the court doesn’t hear this till December, by the time they rule, we’ll be really pushing a year since this issue came up. Andrew Weissmann: By contrast, New York is chugging along. And that is an example of the legal system, I think, working where there has been a trial already. It has been concluded. There is the typical process of post-trial motions. There’s been a little bit of a delay, but not in the date, the September 18th date that the judge set for either a sentencing or some proceeding consistent with his rulings before then. But it could easily be, and I think it will be, a sentencing. That September 18th date, that is still there. What got delayed a bit is there was a motion made, it’s the third one, by Donald Trump to recuse the judge, this time based on the fact that Kamala Harris is now the Democratic nominee. And so there is briefing that happened on that. And the judge said he’s going to issue a decision sometime this week. So what he also said is in connection with the immunity motion, he put that off by a few days as well so that will be decided on September 16th. Mary McCord: But I think it’s also important for folks to know this was requested by Mr. Trump’s team. So when you said the third recusal, that’s because early on in the case, they sought Judge Merchan’s recusal based on his daughter working for a political consulting firm that had had Biden and Harris as clients at various times and had other clients. The judge had denied that, but he had sought the advice of the Judicial Advisory Commission or whatever it is called, something like that in New York, which had said there’s no actual conflict. This is your daughter’s business. Your daughter can engage in her business without it, meaning that you have a conflict. Then there was a first renewed motion for recusal, I think in April of this year, which he denied. So this is now a second renewed motion for recusal, which is why we’re up to three. And the only thing that’s renewed about this is, oh, now Vice President Harris is now the presidential nominee for the Democratic ticket and so that makes this all so much worse. But Mr. Trump’s attorneys did say, will you decide this before you go on to decide immunity? Because obviously they want to have Judge Merchan recuse. They want to see if they can probably take that up to the First Division, which has already denied the appellate First Division in New York, which has already denied an appeal from the first denial of the first recusal motion. I realize that’s a lot of use of the word denial in there. Andrew Weissmann: Denied, denied, denied. Mary McCord: Denied, denied, denied. Right. But at any rate, they’d like to have a different judge on this case. And so they’re trying again. And so Judge Merchan has accommodated by saying, I’ll decide this recusal motion first. I’ll decide it this week. That means I’ll be pushing off my decision on your motion to vacate the jury’s verdict based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. That’s one we talked about extensively a couple of episodes ago. And that decision I’ll make September 16th. And then I want to get to the point where you were just going to when I rudely interrupted you, because I think this is very interesting. He says, please note, this is in Judge Merchan’s letter ruling for the parties and for everyone. The court appearance scheduled for September 18th, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., remains unchanged. We will proceed on that date and time to the imposition of sentence or other proceedings as appropriate. Please keep these dates in mind if you still wish to file a pre-sentence recommendation. And the reason this is so interesting to me is, remember, other proceedings as appropriate could be that if he thinks after he reads all of the briefing on the immunity argument, and actually since we had a last episode, we’ve had the Trump reply brief filed, which doesn’t make any more, frankly, plausible arguments than the ones we discussed about his opening brief. There are some arguments there, but it doesn’t make anything new or different, frankly, other than sort of rehashing what’s already been said. The other proceedings could be if he thinks there needs to be a hearing on some of the evidence that was admitted at trial and whether that was official X evidence that shouldn’t have been admitted, a hearing on anything else. But what’s really interesting is he’s saying, otherwise we’re going to sentencing. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Mary McCord: So if you want to file a sentencing memo, you’ve got to file it. My expectation, Andrew, here’s what I’m expecting, is they’re going to come in, Trump’s attorneys and say, we shouldn’t have to file any sentencing recommendation until we know what your decision is on immunity. What do you think? Andrew Weissmann: So first, I was going to say the body that issued the ethics opinion is the Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics. Mary McCord: Thank you. Andrew Weissmann: It’s a New York body. And so they had already approved this. So just to be clear, everyone should understand, that’s sort of the recusal issue. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It is really frivolous because, as the state said, it’s been litigated already. It’s been decided. There’s nothing new. In fact, Donald Trump had already brought up the Kamala Harris facts -- Mary McCord: Yes. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- so that is something that people should really, I think, not be that concerned about given the prior rulings and the judicial opinions and the appellate rulings. On the issue of immunity, I do think that what is going to happen is there’s now a very short window between the date -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that the judge said he’s going to issue his decision, which is the 16th of September, and the date on which sentencing may occur, which is the 18th. I think that Donald Trump on the 16th is going to be filing all sorts of legal briefs -- Mary McCord: Yup. Andrew Weissmann: -- in New York, and up to and including and be ready to go to the Supreme Court -- Mary McCord: The Supreme Court, yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- trying to stay the sentencing saying that the judge got the immunity issue wrong and there should be a stay of that case and there should be no imposition of sentence. Mary McCord: Of course, you’re assuming that the judge decides a particular way on the immunity issue. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. And so I do think that there is going to be this flurry on the 16th -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- by Donald Trump. Just to be clear on that, I don’t blame a defense lawyer, as long as the arguments are made in good faith. That’s what their job is. Mary McCord: I agree. Andrew Weissmann: But I think everyone should be ready for that as the next step. I also just wanted to say, with respect to their reply brief, one of the reasons that I think that’s so clear is their reply brief, I think, is beautifully written. It, to me, was written by a Supreme Court appellate lawyer. It reads sort of very differently than the trial briefs that I read below. And so it suggests to me that they’re very much thinking about the audience for this going forward. I also thought there were some interesting references. And one thing that I thought was -- Mary McCord: The part about the redaction? Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: Yes. I did too. I was hoping we could talk about that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So there clearly was some evidence, and it’s redacted, meaning that it’s blacked out, referring to evidence heard by the grand jury, not the trial jury, but the grand jury. So clearly there was some evidence related to conversations that Donald Trump appears to have had with some advisor or person while he was president. And so the argument is that that’s official act evidence, and it came before the grand jury and so it tainted the grand jury process. As we talked about in prior shows, it’s a strained argument, but here, at least, there seems to be some evidentiary evidence. It doesn’t seem particularly major. It obviously was not something that came out at trial, because then there wouldn’t be a reason to really redact it in the same way. I did want to say one thing that I thought was really curious. And this is going to be super in the weeds, but I think it might be, Mary, maybe something that really goes to and it appeals to your appellate heart, which is on page six of the brief, the Trump team wants to argue why there was good cause for their not raising this issue. They say they did raise it sufficiently -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- but they also say there was good cause for not raising it. And they cite to a case that says that good cause is shown where there is an intervening Supreme Court decision, and this is their term, upends established decisional law. So when you have new law from the Supreme Court that upends established decisional law, and they say, this is a quote, page six, quote, “that is exactly what happened here.” What I loved about that is, that’s not their argument in the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Their argument in the Supreme Court was like, this is established, and this is implicit, and blah, blah, blah. I mean, this was the Biden administration argument, the Michael Dreeben argument. But I just thought it was just like, what a flip flop on that. Mary McCord: No, I noticed the same thing and paused on that. Andrew Weissmann: I’m learning from you. This is like my appellate antenna are up. Mary McCord: I guess I would generally agree with you. This is written a little bit better. I just don’t think there’s a lot new in here except the revelations from the redacted portion. There have been redacted portions on the original motion and on the D.A. Bragg’s opposition that showed us there had been someone who had testified in the grand jury that had given testimony that Trump is now claiming was official acts testimony and should not have been admitted, even if it was in support of unofficial acts under the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. And that because of that, it tainted even the indictment. So the whole case couldn’t go forward. That’s how this is coming up in this motions, just so that people understand. And I kept thinking, I wonder who that was who testified, and I wonder what they testified about because it’s all redacted. And the reason it’s redacted is grand jury proceedings are secret, generally speaking, and it might have been there were protective orders there or something. I’m not sure. But this is the first time we see, and I think this was probably purposeful, that in the reply, they refer to the person who testified as a White House advisor. And that is the first time we’ve seen that. It’s not just somebody else who maybe was a privy, let’s say, to conversations in the White House who testified about it. They actually call this person a White House advisor. So that’s somewhat revealing and I’m sure there’s lots of speculation about who that was. But the legal implications of this, I think, are, again, we’re back to the fallout from that Supreme Court immunity decision, right? First, you’re at the January 6 case and what’s official and what’s unofficial. Now we’re at the Manhattan case. I think most of us feel like the charges there is all about unofficial conduct. But now it’s about what evidence came in and supported those charges. And now it’s about what evidence came in just at the grand jury in support of the indictment. Because according to Mr. Trump, if the indictment was based on things that were official acts, then you can’t continue with this. So lots of fallout, lots of fallout. It continues. Andrew Weissmann: So, should we take another break and move on to listener questions? Mary McCord: Yes. We should. Andrew Weissmann: Sounds great. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Hey, Mary, listener question time. So this is a question we get a bunch. It relates to something we’re just talking about. And the question from Kathy is, can you please try to explain to us why committing a crime would be considered an official act by a president? But that is a great question because there’s so much common sense. So can you please try to explain to us why committing a crime -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- would be considered an official act by a president? There’s other related things like who decides it, but that’s such a great question because, just so the listener understands, Judge Henderson in the D.C. Circuit basically asked a really similar question. Mary McCord: Yes, that’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, what’s the answer, Mary? Mary McCord: So I mean, it’s really because the Supreme Court told us it could be. That’s the bottom line. Andrew Weissmann: Wait, this is like because I told you so. Mary McCord: Yeah, exactly. Andrew Weissmann: Because it’s, wait, wait, because it’s my house. Mary McCord: Yeah, it’s kind of how it feels, right, like right now in the Supreme Court. So, you know, what the Supreme Court is doing here, remember, this is an immunity decision. It’s not a decision saying that things are not crimes, but it’s saying that there are certain actions and conduct that a president can take. Well, first of all, two categories here. Some things are committed exclusively to the president because they are core constitutional functions of the presidency, and for that, a president is absolutely immune for prosecution, even if the execution of those functions technically violates a criminal law. And one of the problems with that part of the decision is they define these core constitutional functions extremely broadly and going well beyond what the words of the constitution says. Remember, even Michael Dreeben, arguing for the special counsel in the Supreme Court, admitted there would be some things that a president couldn’t be prosecuted for, things like the pardon power that is in the constitution. It’s given to the president. So even though we feel, I think most people would feel like there could be a misuse of that pardon power in a way that potentially could be criminal, that’s something there’s immunity for. Other types of things that are explicitly in the constitution, the president is immune from. But the Supreme Court went farther and said within the outer perimeter of a president’s official acts, there is presumptive immunity from prosecution and a prosecution can only go forward for those things if the government proves that it would pose no dangers to the functions and authority of a president by doing that prosecution. So, okay, that’s my long-winded response about what the Supreme Court said. What does that really mean? What it means is that within certain things, and the Supreme Court told us one of these things, when the president talks to his department of justice, his attorney general, deputy attorney general, assistant attorney generals about investigations and prosecutions, even if he is doing that to try to urge a sham investigation, they use those very words because that’s the allegations of this indictment, that would be immune because it’s within the presidential’s constitutional functions to communicate with his own executive branch. There are other things they didn’t decide would be immune, but the principle remains. If it’s something that’s within this outer perimeter of a president’s official acts, which could involve things like his communications with his own vice president, for example, that’s one of the issues, could potentially even involve things like pressure on state legislators because he’s telling them, communicating to them, I think there was fraud in the election, even if it was bogus, even if it was unsupported, these are the things that the Supreme Court is saying he may, not conclusively, but he may be immune from depending on whether prosecution would pose any danger to the authority and functions of the president. So it is a difficult decision to square with rule of law and the very basis for why we have a criminal code in the United States and in the individual states, which is to, you know, create a deterrent as well as punishment for behavior that society through its laws and statutes has decided is not lawful and is illegal and is deserving of, you know, accountability and holding people accountable. And so it’s not enough to say, and this is the Supreme Court being very clear, it’s not enough to say this behavior violates a criminal statute. It’s got to be behavior that the president is not immune from prosecution for. Andrew Weissmann: Two very, very quick points. One is that the Supreme Court said for the lower court in deciding what is official presidential conduct versus unofficial presidential conduct cannot consider whether it is illegal conduct. And they can’t consider that. Mary McCord: Or the motive behind it either, right? Andrew Weissmann: Also the motive. Mary McCord: The corrupt motive. Andrew Weissmann: One answer to Kathy is that in making a decision between what is official conduct by the president and unofficial, the courts explicitly said you cannot consider whether Congress has rendered that conduct illegal. And the second point is I actually wrote a piece for “Just Security” very much on this issue in case you really want to be nerdy because although I understand this when it gets to true core conduct -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- that’s committed to the president, such as the pardon power. When you’re dealing with other broader actions by the president, for instance, and I’m not going to go through my entire piece for “Just Security,” don’t worry. But if the president is acting pursuant to a congressional statute that gives the president authority to act -- Mary McCord: That’s not his core constitutional powers, and it’s not -- Andrew Weissmann: And also, what would stop Congress from saying, we’re going to give you these powers, but we’re also going to make it a crime if you do X, Y, and Z with them? I mean, in other words, you make that contingent. Mary McCord: They can’t put parameters on it, right? They can’t put requirements on it. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: That just seems nonsensical. And that’s what I wrote about. And it’s possible that that will get narrowed later, and especially if this composition of the Supreme Court changes. Anyway, Kathy, thank you so much for that. It’s such a great, great question. Mary McCord: And to her last part of her question, which is, will this eventually go back to the Supreme Court for them to decide? It certainly could. It depends on what Judge Chutkan does. And then it depends on who wins this election, because the whole case could be over or it could not be over after the election. Okay, let’s go on to one more, which is a great question, particularly given some recent statements made by Mr. Trump. This is from Lauren in Australia. Should Trump lose and decide he doesn’t want to be Defendant Trump anymore? What is stopping him from fleeing the country to, say, Russia, Belarus, or Venezuela and escaping justice that way? Is there anything your criminal justice system can do to prevent that? Andrew Weissmann: So I love that this is from Lauren in Australia. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So welcome, international crowd. I love it. This is very topical, as you said, Mary, because I believe yesterday, Donald Trump, in his discussions with Elon Musk, talked about going to Venezuela to escape prosecution and asking or inviting Mr. Musk to visit. And even if that was facetious, and I’m not saying it is, it’s somewhat remarkable to me when I use the word somewhat, that is facetious. It is remarkable that somebody who used to be the head of our government would be joking about something like that. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: I don’t know about you, but I’ve had defendants flee on me, not very often. It’s not fun. So the process of giving bail is the process by which after a defendant is charged and brought to court, the judge decides whether they can be released and under what conditions they can be released. And it can include things as draconian as home confinement with an ankle bracelet. It can more typically include putting up money or real properties and having co-signers, that is people close to you, who would lose assets and be hurt if you were to flee. And a judge makes that decision after hearing from the pre-sentence people, the defense, the government as to what to do. Sometimes a person is released just on what’s called ROR, on their own recognizance, because the idea is that they’re not a risk of flight or a danger to the community and so you don’t need bail restrictions. So those are ways that the court oversees that process to reduce the risk that somebody would flee. It’s an interesting area because there’s a lot of people who are doing a lot of research on people who are detained rather than being released unnecessarily and there’s a lot of effort and reforms on how bail should be accorded. Obviously, a lot of judges don’t want to be in the position where they’ve released somebody and they flee or something really bad happens, for instance, they were to commit some egregious crime. And so there is a concern about over-deterrence here, sort of over-correcting and there’s a lot of research going on with that. But there are ways to try and prevent people from taking that step. Mary McCord: Can I add two points? Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, absolutely. Mary McCord: One is, one of the common ones is a restriction on travel, including turning in your passport. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Mary McCord: And I know early on in Mr. Trump’s cases, the government did not ask for restrictions on travel or turning in a passport. And I think partly that’s because he was campaigning and, you know, there are times when defendants, I’ve had this happen in many cases of mine, where they’re not allowed to travel outside their state unless they get permission from the court and things like that. So that is one way. I’ve had cases also where the court has made them turn in their passport. So that’s one way to do it here. This is a different circumstance, although that could change. Conditions of release can be modified. The second is a shameless just plug because of work I do in my day job, unrelated to my “Prosecuting Donald Trump” job. One of the things that ICAP does is brings cash bail reform, class action litigation, saying you should not be holding a person solely on cash bail who cannot afford to pay. So if the only reason they’re being detained pretrial is solely because they can’t afford to pay cash bail, whereas another person who could commit the same crime and has the same criminal history could be released if they can pay cash bail, that’s, in our view, an equal protection violation. So to your point, and we’ve drawn upon a lot of the work of researchers, it doesn’t actually prevent recidivism or anything like that. What it does is oftentimes hurt people, particularly people charged with, you know, nonviolent crimes who then potentially are evicted because they can’t pay their mortgage, because they can’t go to work, because they’re detained, et cetera. And we’ve had prosecutors, including former Department of Justice officials and state prosecutors, both, you know, Republicans and Democrats, all come together many times to say that kind of inequity is not constitutional and is not a good policy. So anyway, my shameless plug. Andrew Weissmann: Final comment, just to foot stomp on something you said, Mary, which is that if Donald Trump were to lose the election, and even if he weren’t, but I think particularly if he were to lose, there is nothing that prevents the government from asking the court to reconsider and change the bail conditions to say, you cannot travel, you have to turn over all passports that you have and -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- to tighten up the restrictions, because at that point, you will have a relatively elderly man facing significant criminal exposure in state and federal court and wanting to prevent that. I should note that this is not the first time Donald Trump has talked about going overseas. He earlier in the campaign talked about going to France and sitting in the south of France, rather than being here in the United States, subject to legal accountability. So it’s something to my mind, it’s clearly something on his mind. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So we’ll stay tuned on that. But these were excellent questions. Mary, it was so fun to talk to you and I know it’s time for you to get back to your day job. Mary McCord: Actually, it’s time for me get to my family vacation.

Trump says civilian Medal of Freedom is 'much better' than Medal of Honor,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-service-members-military-medal-of-honor-rcna166891,"Donald Trump appeared to denigrate service members who were injured or killed in the line of duty once again, as he likened a civilian award to a “better” version of the Medal of Honor at a campaign event on Thursday. At an event on antisemitism at his Bedminster golf club, the former president and presidential candidate was introduced by Miriam Adelson, a powerful financial force in Republican politics and the widow of the late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. As he took the mic, the former president spoke highly of the couple and recalled awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, an act that sparked criticism at the time that Trump was rewarding a donor for their financial support. “That’s the highest award you can get as a civilian. It’s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version,” Trump said, referring to the Medal of Honor, a military award. “It’s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump said. “She gets it, and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal, but she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she got it for — and that’s through committees and everything else.” The GOP presidential nominee's off-the-cuff comments on Thursday follow a pattern of insulting veterans and service members, even as he claims to be a fierce supporter of the military. He has called military leaders “some of the dumbest people I’ve ever met in my life” and minimized potentially traumatic brain injuries among service members. In 2015, he infamously attacked Sen. John McCain for being detained in a North Vietnamese prison, saying he liked ""people who weren’t captured."" He also picked a personal fight with family members of a U.S. soldier who died while serving in Iraq. Trump has also long disputed a report from The Atlantic that he called service members who died in wars “losers” and “suckers,” though his former White House chief of staff John Kelly has confirmed some aspects of it."
Trump's immunity remark could be vindicated by the Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-new-york-sentencing-supreme-court-rcna166886,"Donald Trump kept the fact-checkers busy with his latest public remarks on Thursday. But one of his statements, regarding the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, is worth scrutinizing. Indeed, the statement may turn out to have some truth to it — not due to Trump’s honesty, but rather due to the vague and sweeping nature of the ruling itself. Standing outside of his New Jersey golf club, the GOP presidential nominee said, “As you know, the Supreme Court ruled recently on immunity, and I’m immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with.” Yes, the Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity recently (July 1, to be exact). So far, so good. But that he’s “immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with” is not what the court said in the federal election interference appeal. Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion said that there’s no immunity for unofficial acts, that there’s at least presumptive immunity for official acts, and that there’s absolute immunity for exercising the president’s “core constitutional powers.”   What does all that mean in practice? No one knows precisely, perhaps not even the Republican-appointed majority that laid out that new standard. The high court sent the case back to the trial court to figure it out “in the first instance.” So the extent that Trump’s immunity extends to the acts for which he's being prosecuted is yet to be determined. And whatever U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan decides in the first instance could wind up being vetted by the justices again before that trial can go forward. Of course, if Trump wins the election in November, then this may become legally moot, should he order the DOJ to withdraw his two federal criminal cases. (Special counsel Jack Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the federal classified documents case.) Both the timing and convoluted substance of the Supreme Court ruling, then, could amount to an effective grant of immunity to Trump if he’s able to crush his case before the Roberts Court even articulates more clearly the scope of that immunity. In fact, the ruling’s full effect isn’t even known in his New York criminal fraud case, where he wasn’t charged with official acts and was found guilty before the immunity ruling came out. The issue there stems from another odd feature of Roberts’ ruling, which curbs the use of official acts as evidence to prove guilt of unofficial acts — a point Trump’s lawyers have cited in an attempt to overturn his guilty verdicts prior to sentencing. Judge Juan Merchan in New York is set to rule on Trump’s immunity claim on Sept. 16 and sentence him on Sept. 18 if the immunity issue doesn’t stand in the way. But if Merchan rejects the immunity claim, Trump’s lawyers have signaled their intention to appeal immediately before any sentencing can happen — perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court. In all of Trump’s criminal cases, then, the extent of his immunity is a fact that only a Supreme Court majority can know.

The 7 things Democrats need to do ASAP if they win in November,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 8:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrat-to-do-if-win-november-election-rcna166613,"We've all been there. The electrical outlet in the kitchen that no longer works, the squeaky floorboard, the oily spot on the wall in the basement. You put them on the to-do list and then ... never get around to them. Democrats in Congress have a similar list, but the consequences of their inaction could be much more dramatic: legislative stalemates, democratic backsliding and even economic collapse. It's been clear for a few years that American democracy is in need of repair. While it's tempting to dream about dramatic changes to the Constitution, such as eliminating the Electoral College or reforming the Supreme Court, the reality is that many of the most-needed changes are relatively small and straightforward. In fact, like a homeowner who's avoiding fixing the hallway light as they dream about adding a deck, the fact that these repairs are so mundane is a bit of an obstacle. No one runs for office on updating a dusty old statute. It's much more exciting to propose a constitutional amendment, even if that idea is going nowhere. But checking off some items on this to-do list would help prevent a future catastrophe. Here are seven simple things that Democrats should do: End the filibuster. If Democrats maintain control of the Senate, the first thing they need to do is end the absurd 60-vote threshold to pass laws. They already did away with the filibuster for confirming most federal judges in 2013, and Republicans followed suit in 2017 for Supreme Court justices. It doesn't make sense that passing a law would take more votes than giving someone a lifetime appointment to a job that they can then use to undermine those laws. End the debt ceiling. Even if Democrats win big in November, the odds are high that Republicans will win back a congressional chamber in two years. We've all seen what happens next: Republicans refuse to vote for a routine raising of the debt ceiling, leading to a needless legislative standoff that threatens the world economy. It's long past time to scrap this arbitrary limit, which has just encouraged hostage-taking and pointless brinkmanship. Automatically raise the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage is set by Congress, which only gets around to increasing it every few years. Lawmakers last raised it in 2009, which means it's actually been decreasing in value as inflation has eaten away at it, especially since the pandemic. Social Security benefits are automatically increased each year based on the cost of living. The minimum wage should be as well. Repeal the Comstock Act. This 1873 anti-obscenity law hasn’t been enforced in decades, but recently some conservative activists have sought to revive it to restrict access to abortion medication or even emergency contraception. While this idea hasn’t been tested in courts and certainly won’t be attempted by a Democratic White House, lawmakers should repeal this antiquated law and take that option off the table for good. Limit temporary Cabinet appointments. As president, Donald Trump took advantage of the process for naming acting Cabinet secretaries to circumvent Congress' constitutional role to ""advise and consent"" on appointments. Some of these appointees would not have been confirmed if they had been put up for a vote. Others clearly viewed the temporary appointment as an audition, making them much less likely to stand up to the president. Congress should reform the Vacancies Act. Protect civil servants. Trump also sought new ways to fire people in his administration, signing an executive order in 2020 that would have allowed him to dismiss tens of thousands of federal workers and replace them with loyalists. (One former Republican staffer memorably called those potential replacements “an army of suck-ups."") President Joe Biden repealed that order and sought to add new protections for civil servants, but Congress should pass a law definitively putting this idea to rest. Limit national emergencies. The law allowing presidents to declare national emergencies is in need of updating. Already poorly drafted, it has been reinterpreted and limited by court rulings that allow emergencies to be endlessly renewed. (One issued during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979 is still in place.) Lawmakers from both parties are interested in giving Congress more power to end a national emergency. The list doesn't end here, of course. Congress will also need to consider more serious reforms, including updating voting rights laws, continuing to fight climate change and codifying abortion rights, to mention a few big-ticket items. Those efforts will require serious debate about the best approach and will likely take time and political will to muscle them through. The to-do list, meantime, is much simpler. If Congress makes most of these fixes, voters will hardly notice them. There will be no ribbon-cutting ceremony for updating an old law and no celebratory campaign ads for preventing a future catastrophe. But that can also be a reason for doing them since voters are also unlikely to get upset about them. And one day, when the storm clouds start gathering, they'll be thankful that they got around to fixing that hole in the roof."
Kamala Harris isn’t just listening to workers. She’s sounding like them.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 7:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-walz-campaign-workers-movements-rcna166623,"With its rallies that pack arenas, Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has harnessed an energy that many have compared to Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Polls in battleground states indicate that the dynamics of the presidential race have fundamentally shifted, but skeptics question if the good vibes can last once the vice president starts to detail policy. Is this burst of excitement, they ask, just the momentary enthusiasm of voters surprised by an unexpected transition? When we pay attention to what Harris and Walz have already said, though, it’s clear they have tapped the energy of worker-driven movements that want to create an economy that works for all of us. The good vibes and the economic vision of this campaign are, in fact, deeply connected. A case in point: The concluding line in Harris’ stump speech last week was echoed by cheering crowds in arenas across the nation. “When we fight, we win!” For those of us who have been supporting low-wage worker movements over the past decade, the slogan is familiar. It’s been a standard rallying cry since McDonald’s workers first organized the Fight for 15 in 2013. Since then, it has been used by service worker unions who have organized everyone from Waffle House servers to Dollar General clerks, Amazon warehouse workers, and graduate student workers on university campuses. “When we fight, we win!” as a slogan gives voice to the frustrations of the 135 million poor and low-income Americans who know that, even when they work two and three low-wage jobs, it’s impossible to get ahead. Not in an economy that has tilted to more explicitly favor billionaires over the past half-century. But “When we fight, we win!” also expresses the agency of working people who’ve stood up to their bosses and their anti-union culture in so-called “right to work” states like North Carolina to assert their power and win better wages and working conditions. Here in North Carolina, where Harris is expected to roll out her economic agenda today, we mobilized the same agency through “Moral Mondays,” which, like the McDonald’s workers’ fight, also began in 2013. When we hear Harris say, “We’re not going back!” we hear an echo of our movement’s cry: “Forward together, not one step back!” Based in Durham, the Union of Southern Service Workers has worked in recent years to unite a coalition of low-wage workers who have often been pitted against one another along racial and ideological lines. Black, white and brown workers have challenged the politics of division while also refusing the typical framing of left versus right and liberal versus conservative. There’s nothing “far left” or radical, they insist, about the people deemed “essential” during the pandemic insisting that they should earn enough from a week’s work to take care of themselves and their families. Despite the Senate’s refusal to raise the minimum wage during the Biden administration, the direct action of low-wage worker unions has helped lift 13 million Americans out of low-wage jobs over just the past two years. Service worker unions have harnessed the anger and disappointment that drive so many low-income Americans away from politics, but these workers aren’t just driven by feelings. As they have organized, they have also made proposals about practical changes that could make a difference in their lives. Harris and Walz have already demonstrated that they are listening to organized labor. In Detroit, they met with the United Auto Workers at their union hall and thanked their president, Shawn Fain, who had been on television the weekend before lobbying Harris to choose Walz as her running mate. The UAW understood him to be the most pro-union among her finalists. In Las Vegas, Harris promised to champion a proposed tax exemption for tips alongside her fight to raise the federal minimum wage. On Tuesday, Walz spoke to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and pledged that a Harris-Walz administration would expand the pro-worker policies he has enacted in Minnesota to every state. Republican candidate Donald Trump, who tries to frame his divisive populism as “pro-worker,” claimed Harris stole the “no tax for tips” idea from him. But the concept, which has been developed as a policy proposal by Nevada’s two Democratic senators, originated with the Culinary Workers Union 226. Other tipped workers have advocated for One Fair Wage and won campaigns at the state level to eliminate subminimum wages for tipped workers. The details of policy matter, for sure, but this much is clear: The Harris-Walz campaign is listening to workers as it crafts its economic agenda. And it is already speaking the language of workers movements. In our work to organize poor and low-income Americans through the Poor People’s Campaign, we’ve seen how politicians who embrace the language of fusion movements for economic justice have the power to both tap into the moral concerns that drive millions of Americans and multiply the energy of grassroots organizing. In our new book “White Poverty,” we use data from the past three decades of U.S. elections to argue that infrequent, eligible low-income voters represent the largest potential swing vote in 2024. As we witness the groundswell of enthusiasm for the Harris-Walz ticket, we see more than good vibes. This is a campaign that has already tapped into the hopes of working people who, for decades, haven’t had a fair shot and is promising an agenda that could inspire them to show up for races down the ticket. We look forward to hearing the details, but we can already celebrate what low-income people across the nation see: A worker’s vision for the economy is already at the heart of this campaign."
Trump likes to act tough. Harris is proving her strength.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-tough-guy-act-crime-immigration-rcna166804,"Donald Trump is obsessed with toughness. He praises foreign despots for being strong, calls for police to be rough with suspects and uses blue-collar workers as props at his rallies. But Trump’s tough-guy persona is an act, and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is calling him out on it. Her campaign and its allies are leaning into Harris’ background as a prosecutor, her advocacy in the Senate and her time as vice president to tout her strength. And they’re contrasting this with Trump’s empty rhetoric and record of failure to show that she’s actually the stronger, tougher candidate. Nowhere is this fight more clear than on immigration. During a rambling and glitch-delayed conversation with billionaire Elon Musk this week, Trump leaned into his usual attacks, falsely accusing Harris of serving as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” For starters, that was never her title — and I should know, since I was working for her at the time. I served as Harris’ chief spokesperson when the president asked her to lead diplomatic efforts to tackle the “root causes” of migration. The vice president led these talks with our partners in Mexico and Central America, focusing on new strategies to expand economic opportunities in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. So, who is stronger: the candidate who complains about border crossings before, during and after his presidency or the one who looks to figure out why they’re happening and work with foreign leaders to address the issue? But her record goes even further back. In a Harris-Walz campaign ad titled “Tougher,” a narrator lists her record as a border-state prosecutor. Harris held drug cartels accountable and jailed transnational gang members. The campaign ad also highlights her support for a bipartisan deal deemed the “toughest border control bill in decades.” The ad ends by declaring: “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” Voters should know the truth: Trump’s weaknesses as a leader are part of the reason why Harris can play offense here. Trump sank a conservative-led border deal in hopes it would help him during the presidential election. He prioritizes fearmongering over welcoming tough solutions to fix our nation’s broken immigration system. Another major issue for the “toughness” question is crime, and again, Harris comes out on top. As the vice president has been saying on the campaign trail: As a former prosecutor, she knows Trump’s type. Her campaign has used that experience to frame her as tough on crime and highlight Trump’s own criminal record. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of an elaborate scheme to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. By contrast, Harris is a seasoned prosecutor who convinced juries to convict fraudsters. While Trump works to distort Harris’ record on crime, his supporters embrace his criminality. At his rallies, the MAGA faithful hold up signs with his mug shot with the words “Never Surrender.” Trump also vows to pardon criminals who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The so-called party of law and order wants these violent criminals to run free. Which of these two candidates is tough on crime? Candidates also prove their strength by how they choose to campaign. Sometimes it is about what you show voters, not what you tell them. Trump is holding fewer events this campaign, spending his time on late-night social media attacks and whining about how unfair everything is. Harris is vigorously barnstorming swing states and focusing on voters’ concerns. During her short time at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has managed to define herself before Trump and other Republicans have landed on an effective countermessage. This battle to control the narrative is playing out before one of Harris’ biggest opportunities to sell herself to the American people: next week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Democrats can use this moment in the spotlight to drill down on the stark differences between a Harris presidency and a second Trump term. It is also an opportunity to elevate Harris’ proven track record and counter Trump’s playbook of lies and half-truths. The next 80 days won’t be easy. But I’ve seen the vice president in action, and I believe she’s tough enough to handle them. She is meeting the moment and prepared for the task at hand. After all, running for president is tough — and so is Kamala Harris.

A secret video shows Project 2025 is still at the heart of a potential second Trump term,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-executive-orders-rcna166767,"In one of the least convincing performances this election season, former President Donald Trump has been trying to put daylight between himself and Project 2025, a 920-page manifesto for the next GOP president to follow. He has insisted that he has never heard of the head of the Heritage Foundation, which has spearheaded the conservative initiative. He not only has heard of him — he also flew on a private plane with him in 2022. Trump’s campaign has tried to divert the public’s focus to the much less detailed, but still extreme, official Republican Party platform, and Trump’s frustration with being linked with the retrograde policies was so great that the head of the project was forced to step down. His campaign then issued a statement welcoming what it called reports of the group’s “demise.” But one of the people who would almost certainly be tapped to implement Project 2025 should Trump win is apparently unconcerned. In a newly released video from a British journalism nonprofit organization, Russell Vought makes it clear that it’s full steam ahead. They’re stilling plan to make their dystopia vision for America a reality. Vought admitted as much in a conversation secretly recorded in a Washington hotel room last month. Unbeknownst to him, the two men he was meeting with were an undercover journalist and a paid actor from the United Kingdom’s Centre for Climate Reporting pretending to be relatives of a wealthy American donor. In the extremely candid chat that followed, as reported by CNN, Vought revealed just how much Project 2025 legwork has already been done: What a perfect summary of the danger of Project 2025 and why the prospect of a second Trump administration shouldn’t be taken lightly. For months after Trump’s January 2017 inauguration, there was absolute chaos as his inexperienced staff struggled to work the levers of power. The executive order to put his promised “Muslim travel ban” into effect was quickly enjoined in federal court, prompting numerous rewrites to pass legal muster. It took three tries before the Supreme Court allowed a much-revised version to be put into place in 2018. Vought’s claim that he and his team are drafting policy documents now speaks volumes about how different January 2025 could be. Vought’s is a name that longtime readers will recognize. He served in the Trump administration, rising to become the head of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Since then, he and other MAGA B-listers have joined forces at the Center for Renewing America, feeding Republicans in Congress some of their most unpopular ideas and least effective strategies. As such, Vought has been a rising figure among what can be generously described as the Trumpist intelligentsia. Accordingly, Vought was tapped to write Project 2025’s chapter on transforming the Executive Office of the Presidency, which laid out his vision for consolidating power in political appointees and away from career officials. He was also the policy chief for the Republican National Committee’s platform committee, further enmeshing himself and his ideas in the fabric of the GOP’s ideology. Even more concerning is that Vought intends to keep his group’s efforts hidden from view until after the election. Another CCR journalist spoke with Micah Meadowcroft, the Center for Renewing America’s research director, who bragged about the clandestine methods being used to get the drafts into the Trump team’s hands: This “second phase” of Project 2025 is what takes the document from being a set of wonky recommendations to an actual blueprint for what the next four years could look like. It’s how Trump triggers the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. It’s how he transforms the Justice Department into his own personal weapon for revenge. And it’s how the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court is given the cover to say it was all done legally. It’s also why Trump is so eager to distance himself from the initiative, as the document’s drafters and overseers readily admit. If enough voters look closely enough at what he intends to do, then there’s a chance for opposition to those actions to take root. We’ve already seen Trump scramble since Democrats began hammering Project 2025 into the public consciousness. It’s ironic that so many Republicans are now trying to say that the only way for Trump to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris is through a focus on policy over personal attacks. If that were the case, then we’d see them embracing and promoting Project 2025 and Vought’s work. Instead, they realize that remaining secretive gives them their best chance at executing their extreme ideas."
I wanted to impeach Oklahoma’s school chief last year. Now some Republicans do too.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 5:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/oklahoma-bible-public-school-mandate-rcna166602,"If ever there was a time to cue up “Ya Got Trouble” from “The Music Man,” it’s now. You might remember the slick con artist who duped a whole town into buying band instruments while scheming to run off with their money. But Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters isn’t a swindler peddling trombones — he’s a self-serving politician on a Christian nationalist crusade to dismantle public education. If the Republican supermajority in the Oklahoma Legislature doesn’t rein him in, he’ll destroy the entire public education system. Walters has consistently put his own political ambitions and divisive cultural wars ahead of the needs of students and teachers. His tenure has been defined by unconstitutional initiatives, reckless mismanagement of taxpayer dollars and a relentless focus on self-promotion. One of Walters’ more alarming moves, his push to mandate Bible instruction in every 5th through 12th grade public school classroom, went into effect with the start of school this week. That move isn’t about education but about using public schools to advance his ideological agenda. Thankfully, most large school districts have refused to implement Walters’ mandated Bible instruction citing doubts about its constitutionality. Indeed, Walters has shown little regard for the Constitution, ignoring the separation of church and state in his quest to reshape Oklahoma’s education system in his own image. His handling of taxpayer dollars has been equally troubling. Take, for example, the funds allocated for emergency asthma inhalers in schools. Walters has let those funds sit unused for over a year. In a letter to the state’s attorney general, he said he wants clarity on how to distribute the money, but he also questioned whether the money allocated to the foundation to provide the inhalers — named for a 16-year-old who died of an asthma attack —  would mean the state is showing preferential treatment to a single vendor. In short, he’s choosing to play politics instead of protecting Oklahoma’s students. That’s not just irresponsible; it’s potentially life-threatening. Democrats aren’t the only ones who are fed up. Recently, 26 Republican state representatives, almost a third of those in the state House, signed a letter demanding an investigation into Walters’ conduct. Written by Rep. Mark McBride, the letter highlights bipartisan concern over the chaos he’s caused. It also expresses unease “about the budget performance, spending priorities, and transparency” of Walters’ office and describes his treatment of state lawmakers from both parties as “unprofessional, beneath the dignity of a statewide elected official, and … contrary to the best interests of the taxpayers and students of Oklahoma.” The Republicans’ letter says Walters has failed to “comply with legislative budgetary directives,” failed to “turn over complete information surrounding the expenditure of state funds for travel,” failed to meet the requirements of the Open Records Act — “which resulted in the Attorney General threatening civil and criminal action” — and defied the “Legislature’s appropriations authority by refusing to execute required funding for critical asthma inhalers.” They say those complaints are “a non-exhaustive list of recent actions” from Walters. That significant percentage of Republicans demanding an investigation might not be enough. House Speaker Charles McCall has said he’ll only consider such a request if 51 of the 81 Republicans in the chamber sign onto the letter. Walters has dismissed his Republican critics as “moderate Republicans.” In a post on X, he wrote, “Ending porn in schools. Driving woke indoctrination out of the classroom.  Demanding accountability. The left and union lackeys call for an investigation and impeachment.  I will never stop standing for parents!” In a news release in which he accuses Walters of “gaslighting,” Oklahoma Republican state Rep. Nick Archer says “multiple elected officials have made reasonable requests regarding [Walter's] use of taxpayer funds and asked that he address critical education issues. Instead, he deflects accountability by referring to Republican legislators as ‘moderate’ individuals who are promoting ‘porn in schools.’” After pointing out that the Oklahoma Legislature is “widely considered one of the most conservative in the country,” Archer writes, “Let me be clear: neither porn nor Ryan Walters belong in Oklahoma schools.” Following his push for Bible instruction in public schools, Walters  championed the establishment of St. Isadora, which would have become the nation’s first publicly funded religious school if the Oklahoma Supreme Court hadn’t ruled against it. A year ago, when I first called for Walters’ impeachment, some dismissed it as partisan politics. But now, as the letter from Republican lawmakers illustrates, even members of his own party are beginning to see the damage he’s done and are calling for the same. Walters has consistently put his political ambitions above the needs of Oklahoma’s students, and the consequences have been disastrous. Much attention has been given to Project 2025 agenda, a far-right blueprint designed to reshape American government. But, under Walters’ supervision, Oklahoma is already serving as a testing ground for policies that aim to weaken public institutions and impose ideological agendas. What’s happening here could happen nationwide if we don’t take action. Among the many lawsuits naming Walters as a defendant, one stands out because, in that case, a judge granted a student a protection order preventing Walters from disclosing their identity. The student’s lawyers say Walters and his administration had previously done just that at a public meeting. The student is challenging the state’s discriminatory policy against altering gender designations in school records, and Walters publicly identifying them highlights how his aggressive stance on “radical gender theory” not only contradicts legal protections but also jeopardizes the safety of students. In addition to all the above, under Walters’ leadership, Oklahoma’s student performance metrics have declined, and one study ranked our state's education system the second-worst in the country. Meanwhile, monthly State Board of Education meetings have turned into battlegrounds, with parents, teachers and concerned citizens showing up in protest.  Walters has prioritized his ambitions over the well-being of the people he’s supposed to serve, weaponized religion, mismanaged public funds, and disrespected teachers and administrators across the state. The governor had to issue an executive order to force Walters to stop using taxpayer dollars to pay a PR firm tasked with making Walters look good.   Oklahoma is a test case for a far-right agenda that could rapidly spread to other states, turning public education systems across the country into battlegrounds for ideological wars. His mandate that students read the Bible shouldn’t be viewed in a vacuum. It’s a part of a much more comprehensive plan to erode the separation of church and state all over."

Donald Trump was right: The economy does do better under Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-donald-trump-economy-inflation-rcna166795,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 14 episode of ""The ReidOut."" In a 2004 interview with CNN, Donald Trump said, “The economy does better under the Democrats.”  The 2024 Republican nominee for president wasn’t wrong. And now, we have even more evidence to back up his point.  On Wednesday, we learned that inflation fell to its lowest level in more than three years. That’s not just good news for your pocketbook, it’s really good news for the Federal Reserve, which has been looking for numbers like this to justify cutting interest rates. Do you know what else we found out this week? Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has produced the most oil ever by any nation on Earth. This news is such a big deal that it seemed to trigger Trump. Late Wednesday, Trump held a “messaging event” on the economy in North Carolina.  He was supposed to lay out his economic vision for the future. Instead, he went on for more than an hour with incoherent lies about the currently booming economy and lies about the economy he left for President Joe Biden. Trump said he gave “Harris and Biden an economic miracle” that they turned into “an economic nightmare.” He then made vague promises about lowering inflation … without saying how he’d do that. “My first day back I will sign an executive order directing every Cabinet secretary and agency head to use every tool and authority to defeat inflation,” Trump said.  Then he just wouldn’t stop whining about how Harris supposedly copies him. “When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan it’ll probably be a copy of mine because basically that’s what she does,” Trump said. Trump’s rambling “messaging event” was totally disconnected from reality. Inflation is down, wage growth is outpacing price growth, and violent crime is also down. These are objective facts that don’t care about Trump’s feelings. Vice President Kamala Harris will also be in North Carolina on Friday to lay out her vision for the economy. According to Axios, she’s going to outline how she would lower costs for health care, housing and food for the middle class.  She reportedly wants to break with Bidenomics and hit rising prices head-on, making middle-class economic concerns a key focus of her campaign.

Down-ballot Republicans will suffer under Donald Trump — and it's their own fault,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 2:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-down-ballot-republicans-agenda-rcna166786,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 14 episode of ""The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle."" Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, down-ballot Republicans appear to be getting nervous. Republicans are desperately trying to get former President Donald Trump to stay on message and focus on substance instead of attacking Harris for her crowd size and racial identity.  The last time I was a down-ballot Republican, I was on the ballot with Trump in 2016. So let me tell you how hard this upcoming election will be for them. The real problem here is, it’s not just that Trump is completely incapable of articulating an agenda — down-ballot Republicans really don’t have an agenda either.  This is a cycle where House Republicans have nothing to take to the American people on virtually every piece of legislation of national consequence. From raising the debt ceiling to keeping the government open to funding forces trying to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s march across Europe — it was Democrats, not Republicans, who actually led the governing coalition in Washington.  So as much as these down-ballot Republicans are rightly suffering under Trump’s listless campaign — truly one of the worst presidential campaigns we’ve seen in modern history — most Republicans have nobody to blame but themselves because they don’t have a discernible agenda either."
Donald Trump is teetering on the edge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 1:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-losing-control-kamala-harris-rcna166730,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 15 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio versus Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is literally the campaign of yesterday versus tomorrow. On Wednesday, we saw Trump deliver what was supposed to be a speech about the economy. Instead, he stood there and claimed the United States was a Third World country. I don’t know anyone who believes that.  Trump’s co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, are extremely good at what they do. But that skill doesn’t matter when it seems they have lost control of their candidate.  Trump has a tired, 20-year-old act. He updates it with some new figures from the past two or three years, but, at its core, it’s the same: The election was stolen. We’re a Third World country. Crime is up. Immigrants are going to attack your children — all sorts of fear factors.  And a lot of that act comes with huge, ugly racial overtones — especially in regard to the vice president. It makes you wonder: How long will it be before he really gets out of control? I think that’s going to happen at the debate. He’ll be in the ring with Harris, the vice president of the United States, a very sophisticated, very intelligent woman, and she will hammer him like a prosecutor. She won’t let him off the hook. In that moment, something may snap in him. And that’ll be it."
Trump flunks basic science yet again in speech insulting Harris' intelligence,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-north-carolina-speech-smart-rcna166779,"Donald Trump promised an “intellectual” speech during his campaign stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. True to form, Trump broke his vow. Instead, what rallygoers got were some mind-numbingly misinformed ramblings from a septuagenarian nominee. Over the last several weeks, Trump has lobbed all kinds of puerile insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, attempting to undermine her intelligence. During this very speech, which Trump claimed would focus on the economy, Trump claimed Harris is “not smart.” But it's hard to take such insults seriously when Trump himself fails to grasp some fairly basic concepts involving science and economics. For example, he went on a rant arguing that Harris wants to “abolish oil, coal and natural gas,” and he suggested people who use wind power can't use their electronics when it’s not windy. In reality, the vice president is currently serving in an administration that has overseen a record boom in domestic oil production. And wind turbines are capable of storing power, so people who rely on them do not need to experience some ""Wizard of Oz""-level wind storm to use their appliances and gadgets. But this is not the scenario Trump envisioned in his speech: Trump has long demonstrated his ignorance of and aversion to wind power and other climate-conscious policies. During another rant against wind power back in 2019, Trump admitted he “never understood wind.” Evidently, he still doesn’t. That this confusion comes from a man who’s called climate change a “hoax” and repeatedly claimed that the primary consequence of rising sea levels will be more beachfront property doesn’t inspire confidence in his capacity to confront the issues of climate change or encourage an expansion of renewable energy.  Trump also admitted on Wednesday that he doesn't know what “net zero” means, referring to “Kamala’s extreme high-cost energy policy known as net zero.” But then he took it further: In reality, many people — all over the world — are familiar with the term (but if you're not, “net zero” refers to the point at which the amount of greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount being removed from the atmosphere). In fact, there are even quick, eye-catching videos online that explain the concept in simple terms for people like Trump who don’t know what it means. So much for science. On the economics front, Trump demonstrated his grasp of the subject by holding up a large package of Tic Tac mints next to a smaller one and saying, “This is inflation.” He didn’t elaborate. He went on to talk about how inflation, which has actually been slowing as of late, is destroying our country. How the existence of different size packages of mints connects to inflation was left for the audience to guess at.  Trump is the leader of an entire political party, with staff and advisers who could help fill in the gaps in his knowledge, to educate him and his followers. But Trump seems perfectly content to wallow in ignorance — and to pull the MAGA faithful into the misinformed muck with him."
Harris — like Trump — wants to stop taxing tips. That’s a bad idea.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-economic-plan-leave-one-ill-advised-strategy-rcna166782,"In the three weeks (yes, it has only been that long) since she became a candidate for the White House, Kamala Harris’ campaign has proven remarkably skilled and successful. Which is why it was strange to see Harris make what might have been the first major mistake of her campaign: Adopting one of Donald Trump’s new policy positions, ending federal taxation of income from tips.  Like many tax proposals, ending taxation on tips has an intuitive appeal — until you consider its true implications. So the Harris campaign made a misstep in two ways: Appearing to parrot Trump, and doing so in the service of a bad idea.  The proposal has all the earmarks of something Trump heard somewhere, tested out before a crowd, and when it got a round of applause, decided it would become an official position of his candidacy. It’s unlikely he put more than a few moments of thought into it, let alone considered all the pros and cons. But there is a version of it in Congress, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. One of its biggest problems is that it doesn’t contain safeguards preventing the wealthy from shifting their income into something they’ll call “tips,” thereby enabling them to avoid paying taxes.  The Harris campaign says her proposal — which, like Trump’s, hasn’t yet been laid out in detail — “comes with an income limit and with strict requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of the policy.” It would apply only to service workers in industries such as retail and hotels. Which is why both candidates have promoted the idea in Nevada, a swing state where a large number of workers are employed in the hospitality industry.  Nevertheless, Trump’s promise didn’t exactly transform the race; the powerful Culinary Workers Union in Nevada, which along with its parent union UNITE HERE has endorsed Harris, wasn’t impressed by his proposal. “Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” one top official said.  As tax proposals go, this one is limited in its effects: An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows that of the approximately 4 million Americans who rely on tips, more than a third already make too little to owe any federal income taxes. But if Harris really wants to start a salutary discussion about tipping, she could propose eliminating the practice entirely, or at least scaling it back. We’ve all noticed how tipping has spread like wildfire; it seems like almost every purchase you make is now accompanied by a request for a tip, even when you received nothing resembling “service” at all. More importantly, tipping is a practice that has deeply racist roots; as an Economic Policy Institute report notes, “Following the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, formerly enslaved Black workers were often relegated to service jobs (e.g., food service workers and railroad porters). However, instead of paying Black workers any wage at all, employers suggested that guests offer Black workers a small tip for their services.”  Today, while the minimum wage hasn’t been raised from $7.25 an hour in 15 years, employers are allowed to pay tipped workers a minimum of just $2.13 — and that latter figure has remained the same for 33 years. The law says that if their tips don’t bring their total income up to $7.25, then employers are supposed to pay them the difference, but they don’t always do so, one of many forms wage theft takes. That’s just one kind of exploitation tipped workers are subjected to; millions of female servers have to grin and bear constant sexual harassment from customers, because their income is dependent on not angering the guy who just made an offensive remark or put his hands on their body. One survey found 70% of female servers saying they had experienced sexual harassment.  But if tipping is going to be with us at least for now, wouldn’t exempting tips from taxes still give a hand to low-wage workers? Perhaps some, but it would come with unintended consequences. For instance, lower income subjected to taxes today would mean lower benefits for those workers when they retire. As Berkeley economist Sylvia Allegretto notes, “Tips that are not taxed will not be credited towards the time and amount that workers are putting towards their Social Security.” So they would end up gaining very little if anything out of the deal. Lowering taxed income would also reduce the amount some workers would receive through the Earned Income Tax Credit.  There’s also a fundamental principle guiding proposals like this one that progressives should push against at every opportunity: that some kinds of income deserve to be treated better by the tax system than other kinds. Why should a person earning $25,000 a year in tips waiting tables at a diner not pay taxes, while a person earning the same $25,000 at a fast-food restaurant next door should? “As a general rule, you want to treat all income the same,” says Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “You don’t want to give people an incentive to game the tax code. This is one reason (in addition to giving a lot of money to rich people) that most on the left hate the carried interest deduction. We allow some of the richest people in the country to have much or most of their wage income to be taxed at the capital gains rate.” Just as we shouldn’t tax investment income at a lower rate than the income people get from working, it violates progressives’ belief in equality to say certain kinds of work should be exempt from taxes while other kinds shouldn’t.  Vice President Harris will be releasing her economic plan soon, and we should hope that it contains proposals that will make a difference to more Americans. Those could include increasing both the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage (or better yet, eliminating the distinction entirely), restoring the increased Child Tax Credit that was in place during the pandemic, and strengthening the ability of workers to form unions. All that would be much more meaningful than a proposal that amounts to little more than a gimmick. After all, if Trump thinks it’s a good idea, we should all be suspicious."
Michael Cohen's Supreme Court appeal is a long shot. These experts just explained why it's still important.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/michael-cohen-supreme-court-appeal-amicus-brief-rcna166721,"Michael Cohen asked the Supreme Court last month to take up his appeal against Donald Trump and others, seeking civil damages for alleged government retaliation during the former president's administration. Cohen picked up support this week from a group of constitutional scholars and former federal officials, who urged the justices to review the case.  The appeal from Trump’s former lawyer and fixer “raises questions that go to the heart of ordered liberty and the rule of law,” they wrote in their amicus brief. That’s true. But the challenge for Cohen is that the type of claim he’s pressing is one that the Supreme Court has all but abandoned. In a 1971 case called Bivens, the high court allowed a damages claim against federal officials for alleged Fourth Amendment violations. But the court has taken a stingy view since then, routinely rejecting so-called Bivens claims. In a 2022 decision, Justice Clarence Thomas’ majority opinion cited Bivens while noting: “Over the past 42 years, however, we have declined 11 times to imply a similar cause of action for other alleged constitutional violations.” Thomas wrote that the court will deny claims “in all but the most unusual circumstances.” Mindful of that high bar, the scholars and former officials do well to stress the extreme events underlying Cohen’s petition. “The extraordinary facts alleged here illustrate the essential necessity of deterrence to the rule of law,” they wrote:  “The stakes could not be higher,” they went on, arguing that ruling against Cohen “sends a clear signal to federal actors that critics of the government can be punished without repercussion for exercising their constitutional rights.” In addition to Trump, Cohen sought damages against former Attorney General Bill Barr and other Trump-era officials. Trump lawyer Alina Habba, who’s been sanctioned for frivolous Trump-related litigation, has called Cohen’s case frivolous. Habba’s response to Cohen’s petition is due Sept. 13, days before the GOP presidential nominee is set to be sentenced Sept. 18 in his New York criminal case (though his lawyers are attempting to delay that sentencing). After the response is filed, Cohen can file a reply brief. It takes four justices to grant review. So, will they take the case? The state of the law stacks the odds against Cohen — and that’s without accounting for whatever additional political considerations might factor into the court’s calculus. But the case highlights the dangers of officials retaliating against critics without a legal remedy to check that behavior. It’s an issue that goes beyond Trump and Cohen, but it’s especially difficult to ignore in the shadow of a potential revenge-packed second Trump term.

"Donald Trump seeks to delay New York sentencing, citing immunity ruling",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 9:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-ny-hush-money-sentencing-delay-rcna166750,"In their latest delay bid, Donald Trump’s lawyers want Judge Juan Merchan to push the former president's New York sentencing to some time after the presidential election. Among the reasons they cite in a letter dated Wednesday is the Supreme Court’s ruling that granted at least some presidential immunity in criminal cases. It seems unlikely that Merchan, who just rejected Trump’s latest request for the judge to recuse himself, will agree to another adjournment. The immunity ruling already led the judge to push Trump’s sentencing from July to Sept. 18. Merchan is set to rule on Sept. 16 on Trump’s motion to set aside his guilty verdicts (rendered in May, prior to the July 1 immunity decision) on the grounds that they run afoul of the Supreme Court’s new immunity rule. If Merchan rejects Trump’s motion, then that would clear the way for sentencing two days later. But if Merchan rules against Trump’s immunity claim, then the Republican presidential candidate’s lawyers have signaled that they want to appeal such an adverse decision before Trump is sentenced. “A single business day is an unreasonably short period of time for President Trump to seek to vindicate these rights, if he must,” they write. They argue that an adjournment is necessary “to allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling.” The letter notes that the immunity ruling, which arose in the federal election interference case, happened in a pre-trial posture and that the Supreme Court said that immunity issues are appealable pre-trial. “It follows that any denial of the pending motion is immediately appealable in a similar procedural posture,” Trump’s lawyers write. However, the New York case is different because Trump was already found guilty before the Supreme Court made its decision on immunity. So this case is in a post-trial posture, not pre-trial. Nonetheless, his lawyers argue in their letter that until the prosecution’s “immunity violations are addressed fully and finally, this Court may not ‘adjudicate’ the matter — including at sentencing.” Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove also write that an adjournment is necessary to prevent prosecutors from filing their sentencing position to the court while the immunity issue is pending. They argue that prosecutors “should not be permitted to file a public sentencing submission that will include what the Supreme Court described as the ‘threat of punishment,’ in a manner that is personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the Presidency as a result of the type of ‘peculiar public opprobrium’ associated with these proceedings that troubled the Trump Court.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

I’m Andrew Weissmann, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: You know, it’s starting to feel like every minute is a year. I mean, between like the legal news and the political news, it’s like -- Mary McCord: And the Olympics news. Andrew Weissmann: The Olympics news. You know, I always forget how much I enjoy watching the Olympics. Mary McCord: Oh, me too. Andrew Weissmann: And it’s a really good distraction from the aforementioned legal and political news. Mary McCord: Exactly, right. And actually, before we get to the show today, we do want to tell you about a new way to listen to our podcasts and to other original shows from MSNBC.

Andrew Weissmann: Right. So we’re still going to be available. And speaking of that, we’re going to have a new bonus episode for premium subscribers. It’s coming out this Monday. And for the first offering, it is a colleague of yours now, Steve Vladeck. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: He is a longtime professor, but now a new Georgetown law professor. So Steve is going to join Mary and me for a deep dive into a really interesting topic, which is President Biden’s proposed Supreme Court reforms. Mary McCord: And you can subscribe to MSNBC Premium on Apple Podcasts right from your phone or whatever device you’re listening on right now, so you don’t miss anything. But let’s jump to today’s episode. Things are gearing back up. Listeners probably know that the Supreme Court remanded the January 6th related case back down to the D.C. Circuit on Friday, which immediately sent it back to Judge Chutkan. So we will talk about the next steps in that case. Boy, the fallout continues. We’ll talk about continued fallout of that immunity decision. Now we’ve got Jeffrey Clark asking for a dismissal of his bar disciplinary proceedings in D.C. as a result of that decision. And of course, we’ve got action on Capitol Hill with the introduction of the No Kings Act, really to respond directly to the immunity decision. And then finally, we will talk about some news that broke yesterday, an agreement to cooperate by Jenna Ellis with the state A.G. in Arizona in the case they are brought against fraudulent electors and those who supported them and facilitated that scheme. And we are really going to try to do a list of questions. Andrew Weissmann: And, yes. Mary McCord: That’s our goal. Andrew Weissmann: We are getting to them. Mary McCord: We’re going to do it. Andrew Weissmann: You know, we were actually going over them before the show. And they’re really, really terrific. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So we’re going to get through that agenda and then get to the listener questions. So let’s talk about, again, it’s more fallout from the Supreme Court immunity decision. But this is sort of direct fallout because the case is now back with Judge Chutkan. This is normal procedure where the baton goes back from when cases on appeal, it goes back to the district court. And here, Judge Chutkan really wasted no time. And there’s sort of two main things that she did. The first is scheduling. She issued an immediate scheduling order. And the first thing she did is she said she wants to hear from the parties jointly, if possible, in a submission where she said, please state any agreements. You can always put disagreements by this Friday as to what you think the way forward is. What do you think the next steps are? Should there be a hearing? Should there be briefing? What do you think the timing should be? So the parties are going to put something in by this Friday. Spoiler alert. Mary McCord: Do you think there’ll be any disagreements? What do you think? Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Spoiler alerts. Mary McCord: I think they’re going to agree on everything. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So spoiler alert. Donald Trump will be no long briefing -- Mary McCord: No. No. No. Andrew Weissmann: -- no hearing. Mary McCord: Stay everything until after the election. I bet that’s what he’ll say. Andrew Weissmann: This was from the man who said, you know, please set the trial for the year, you know, 20 -- Mary McCord: 2026. Andrew Weissmann: Maybe I should say 2040. Mary McCord: Yeah, that would be more likely. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So there’s that scheduling where she said, I want to hear from the parties this Friday. That is a filing that we all should be able to see. It should be filed on the docket. And then she said she wants to see the parties. The defendant does not have to be there, meaning Donald Trump does not have to be there for a scheduling conference to decide what should happen. And that is going to happen next Friday. So the two dates are August 9th and August 16th. So we’ll have some updates and presumably a decision on the 16th from Judge Chutkan as to how she wants to proceed, having heard from the parties. So that’s sort of step one. And step two is something we’re going to spend more time talking about. And I’ll turn it over to you in a second. Just the preview is that there was a pending motion that, actually a lot of pending motions, but there was a pending motion that Donald Trump had made that was for dismissal of the case for selective prosecution and vindictive prosecution. They’re slightly different, different legal standards, but they’re similar in kind and generally one sort of goes with the other. And as you recall, during the stay period from December until last Friday, Judge Chutkan could not rule on anything. Mary McCord: But she was clearly working. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah, she may have had it already, but on Friday she got the green light and she issued her 16-page decision denying Donald Trump’s selective and vindictive prosecution motion. So those are the big highlights of where we are. But obviously the big issue is going to be about the immunity case and what its import is in terms of the case going forward. Mary McCord: Yeah, absolutely. And I do want to bring people back because, you know, this case was stayed for a long time, right? Well, actually, before the Supreme Court even took it, it was stayed during the D.C. Circuit appeal. And so it’s been stayed for a very long time. Obviously, she was taking motions that had already been briefed and obviously had her a written and ready to go as soon as she got the case back, which is the opinion you’re talking about. But just for listeners to remember, there were a whole slew of motions to dismiss. And I went through all of them yesterday to make sure there’s now nothing outstanding. And the motion to dismiss on immunity grounds is obviously the one that generated the ultimate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. She had also denied at that same time when she denied the immunity motion or the motion to dismiss based on immunity. She had also denied a motion to dismiss based on constitutional grounds that Trump’s prosecution violated the First Amendment, violated the double jeopardy clause, violated due process. That was denied also and that is now done. She also on Friday in that same short order where she set a schedule for the parties to propose the pre-trial proceedings going forward and also set a hearing, the same ones you just talked about, Andrew. In that short order, she also denied the motion to dismiss the indictment based on statutory grounds. And she denied that without prejudice for the defendant, Mr. Trump, to refile a renewed motion once all of the issues of immunity have been resolved. And what that meant, that motion on statutory grounds, which was the only other motion to dismiss that was still pending besides selective and vindictive prosecution, which she has now denied. That was the only other one that had remained pending and that was basically Donald Trump saying these allegations against me and the indictment are not covered by the statutes that the prosecution is relying upon to charge me. They’re just not within what these statutes covered and so this should all be dismissed. Now, I think it’s interesting, and you’ll see again, this is about immunity fallout. She’s saying I’m denying that right now, but you can renew it after we make decisions about what are official acts for which you can’t be prosecuted or official acts for which the government has or hasn’t rebutted a presumption of immunity from prosecution, what are unofficial acts for which you can be prosecuted, and are those still things that would be covered by the statutes. The conspiracy under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 371, the obstruction and conspiracy to obstruct official proceedings and ultimately the conspiracy to violate civil rights. So that’s why that is open to being re-brought after all the decisions about immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And there is also the Fischer case that we talked about. Essentially, the judge is saying, let me see what remains and after everyone’s been heard and we have a hearing and there’s no reason to decide something in the abstract. Mary McCord: The Fischer case being the Supreme Court case about obstruction of an official proceeding, which, as we’ve talked about before, we think will apply very differently when we’re talking about Mr. Trump -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- because it applies to things that are well beyond any violent assault on the Capitol and include the fraudulent elector scheme, for example. Andrew Weissmann: So I wanted to take just a couple of minutes just to explain what selective and vindictive prosecution means just in the big picture, not getting too in the weeds just because it’s the kind of thing, Mary, you and I know so well from litigating these matters. So selective prosecution, it is required for the defendant to show that somebody similarly situated to the defendant was not prosecuted. That’s sort of step one. And again, there’s lots of nuance to that. But the second part is that the decision to prosecute this person was done with a discriminatory reason, so like based on race or assertion of constitutional right, something like that. It is a very, very hard standard to meet. And then let me just talk about vindictive prosecution, because it’s a very related concept. Vindictive prosecution is when the government is alleged and then shown to have taken action against a defendant because of their assertion of a right. So where it comes up at times is somebody is charged with crimes A and B and the defendant makes motions, appeals and maybe win something, maybe doesn’t win. And then after the appeal, there’s more charges brought, and the defendant can say, wait a second, you’re retaliating for just my litigating. Mary McCord: Well, try having a due process right to do. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Constitutional right. Andrew Weissmann: And as you can imagine, the courts say the government can’t do that. But there are many legitimate reasons why you might bring those new charges, because you might have continued the investigation, for instance, and found new evidence. So again, it’s a hard thing to show. And I had just two quick thoughts on that one sort of in the weeds with respect to this judge and one about Judge Cannon. So Judge Chutkan said there just is no showing, no evidence whatsoever with respect to either of those claims that Donald Trump is not similarly situated to anyone who has not been prosecuted, leaving aside that there was no showing of discriminatory purpose or animus whatsoever and goes through the timeline here. And in many ways, when you look for a similarly situated person, you can look for all sorts of factors, including leadership position. So clearly thinking of all of the hundreds of January 6 people who attacked the Capitol and the charges here, which she has to accept as true for the purposes of the motion of his role sort of at the top of that conspiracy. So it’s quite devastating. And she also takes to task the effort by Donald Trump to reframe the indictment as simply charging him for bringing legal actions questioning the validity of the 2020 election. She said that’s not at all what’s charged. In fact, it’s explicitly stated that is not what is being charged. It is joining a criminal conspiracy to do that. Mary McCord: I think in many ways, that’s what’s the most remarkable about her opinion, because honestly, the claims of selective and vindictive prosecution were such a stretch by Mr. Trump and his team. And on the vindictive side, essentially, they were relying on one or two statements made by President Biden about seeking accountability and that kind of thing and hoping there would be accountability for Mr. Trump that, you know, is really what was driving their claim and that’s just not anywhere close to proving even the predicate to get discovery or further hearings, because they wanted a hearing as well on this claim of vindictive prosecution. But she starts right on page two, saying at the outset, court must address, as it has before, defendants improper reframing of the allegations against him. And she says he declares that the indictment amounts only to a government theory that it is illegal to dispute the outcome of an election and work with others to propose alternate electors. And then she says that description mischaracterizes his alleged conduct. Defendant is charged with knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings. And then she quotes from the indictment what you were referring to, Andrew -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- which is actually when the indictment itself says defendant had a right, like every American, to speak publicly about the election and even to claim falsely that there had been outcome determinative fraud during the election and that he had won. He was also entitled to formally challenge the results of the election through lawful and appropriate means. So she’s really just drawing that line right at the beginning. I’m not going to buy into your false narrative about this. I have to correct it because that’s not what’s charged. Andrew Weissmann: Right. And one thing to note is she’s very careful. She’s not saying that’s what happened. She is not making a fact finding. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: She is taking the allegations in the indictment and saying your characterization, Donald Trump team, of what is charged is incorrect. But that’s very separate than her saying, and now I’ve had a hearing and I’m making a factual finding. I think that’s a good segue to the fact that this same motion was made before Judge Cannon. Judge Cannon ruled on a very similar motion made by Walt Nauta, a co-defendant in that Florida case, and said, as was obvious, that there is no selective or vindictive prosecution. But notably, Judge Cannon did not rule on Donald Trump’s -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- motion, and she easily could have, but she didn’t, I think, want to give the public that sort of like that win to the government and have this public document saying, no, Donald Trump has not been selectively or vindictively prosecuted, which, by the way, is really clear. But it’s just notable to me that Judge Cannon took the time to decide that motion with respect to -- Mary McCord: For the co-defendant. Andrew Weissmann: -- a co-defendant. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: But not decide it for Donald Trump. And yet, as we’ve talked about, is the outlier judge, one out of nine who issues your decision on the first day of the RNC convention saying the case is dismissed. I mean, the confluence of facts is so bad for the rule of law. And it’s so bad for judges who’ve been appointed by Donald Trump, who are really good judges who are now tarred by that kind of conduct on her part. But anyway, you can tell that Judge Cannon -- Mary McCord: We’re getting triggered. We’re getting triggered. Andrew Weissmann: Trigger Avenue. Mary McCord: Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Mary McCord: So, this is a good time, I think, for us to take a break. And when we come back, we will get back into some of the continued fallout from that immunity decision. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I actually find there’s like a really interesting tie between the selective prosecution arguments and claims that we just talked about and what we’re about to talk about involving Jeffrey Clark. It’s fascinating. I have a theory that I’m going to float and I want to hear, Mary, like what you think and why it’s wrong. Mary McCord: All right. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Mary McCord: Cliffhanger. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. Before we get to Andrew leaving us hanging on a cliff to fall off, I got like one finger. I’m going to just frame up where we’re at with this Jeffrey Clark stuff. So Jeffrey Clark, of course, was at the Department of Justice. He was the person who Mr. Trump wanted to make and arguably did make his acting attorney general for a matter of hours right before January 6th, somebody that had been very willing to buy into Mr. Trump’s claims of election fraud and to pressure states to look into this. And in fact, Jeffrey Clark was at the Department of Justice proposing to send letters to state legislative officials and secretaries of state, particularly, for example, in Georgia, saying you should really be looking into this election fraud. We think there’s a basis for that, et cetera. This, though, is something people will recall from our extended discussion of the immunity decision, that the one thing that the Supreme Court decided that can’t really be re-reviewed down in the lower court, well, can’t be reviewed in lower court, is that with respect to Mr. Trump’s communications with his own Department of Justice officials, that’s within the scope of his official acts, and he is absolutely immune for prosecution based on any sort of pressure on DOJ to actually pressure others to investigate bogus claims of election fraud. So, Mr. Clark, meanwhile, in addition to having been charged in Georgia, he also has faced disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia, where he has his bar license, right. And these are proceedings, and we’ve talked before about lawyers have to pass a bar in any state in which they practice and they are subject to disciplinary proceedings for violating the codes of professional responsibility and committing other ethical violations and certainly for committing crimes. There has been ongoing for some time now these disciplinary proceedings in D.C. before the Board on Professional Responsibility of the D.C. Bar. There was actually an evidentiary hearing or trial where people like other former DOJ officials, Richard Donohue, et cetera, testified. And the recommendation of the board was that Mr. Clark be suspended from the practice of law for two years. Now, he has a right to take that on appeal to the D.C. Court of Appeals, and he will do that and has done that. But in the meantime, before that appeal is fully briefed, he, like so many others, is trying to take advantage of that immunity decision and has filed a motion, not a motion. He’s filed a supplemental brief before the board saying these whole proceedings against me should be thrown out. This court has no jurisdiction. And as the immunity decision makes clear, I can’t be disciplined based on my conversations with the president that are within the president’s official acts. And so this entire disciplinary proceeding should go away. He makes other arguments, too, based on another Supreme Court case that we haven’t even talked about on this podcast called Jarkesy, which has to do with in certain SEC civil enforcement proceedings, a defendant is titled to a jury trial as opposed to just a hearing before judges. So he makes an argument that he should have a jury trial as well. But we’re going to set that aside for now because that would take up way too much of this episode. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: And the main thrust of this is, hey, me too, me too, me too. If Trump’s immune, I’m immune. And as we’ve said before, presidential immunity does not mean immunity for everyone else. But nevertheless, here he is making that argument. Okay, now got one little pinky holding on to the edge of the cliff, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So let me just read some of what Jeffrey Clark says about the immunity decision because he quotes from this. And I think it’s useful because it really goes to the pernicious nature of the immunity decision. And it deals with the part of the decision that you said, Mary, where the court said that President Trump, when he’s dealing with his attorney general, those are core functions of the executive and that even if it’s related to conversations with the attorney general about sham investigations, which was the allegation and the indictment. So he cites this. He says, I’m quoting now, “the allegations against President Trump relating to his discussions with DOJ officials about whether to send the draft letter to Georgia officials and whether to replace the acting attorney general with Mr. Clark.” And now he quotes from the decision, the immunity decision, “plainly implicate Trump’s conclusive and preclusive authority,” unquote, because the executive branch has, and again, a quote, “exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecuting.” And here’s the key part. This is, again, in quotes, “including with respect to allegations of election crime.” And the Supreme Court also said that the president may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions. And here’s, again, the money quote, “with his attorney general and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty.” So you see the problem, which is that although the court was deciding what the president can do when he’s dealing with underlings in the Department of Justice carrying out his orders, or at least arguably carrying them out, what is the level of immunity? Is it within the core functions? And also, how would you go about even using that evidence and proving it in court? Would you have to use official act evidence, which the court also said you can’t use? So Jeffrey Clark is saying that decision really protects him because he was just carrying out the president’s bidding here in terms of what he was doing. Mary McCord: And I would say and I know you want to tie it, but I would say that also he’s essentially -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- and I think this is one of the problems with the capacious language that the Supreme Court used in that opinion is because their rationale for not only immunity, but also the bar on using official acts evidence to prove unofficial acts is essentially that it would interfere with the independence of the executive branch and the carrying out of the president’s core constitutional authority. So that opens the door for underlings, not the president, to say the damage, the harm would be just the same. Andrew Weissmann: The same. Mary McCord: So I should get the benefit of the same immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Right. And you would have to open the door to the kind of evidence that you don’t want to include. And just to make it clear, the allegation here is that Jeffrey Clark’s, the letter that was being sent was false. Mary McCord: False. Andrew Weissmann: That’s the allegation is that they wanted to just like the Ukraine first impeachment, Donald Trump wanted the specter of an investigation. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: He wanted the specter of an investigation about Georgia. He wanted the specter of an investigation about Joe Biden from the Ukraine authorities, even though there was no basis for it, as I think as the president said, like, just make the claim. I’ll take it from there. Mary McCord: Right. And this is where the testimony of people like Richard Donohue, who was the acting deputy attorney general, Jeff Rosen, the acting attorney general at the time, you know, they’re saying we don’t have any evidence of election fraud significant enough to change the outcome. So it is false to put in a letter to state officials that we do. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And I know most listeners are going, how can that possibly be part of the core function? But just to be clear, that is in the immunity decision. And so the quotes that Jeffrey Clark, you can’t fault him for taking the Supreme Court decision and saying, I want to apply it here. To me, the way I think this relates to what we were just talking about with respect to Judge Chutkan is something that I was really concerned about when I read the immunity decision, which is how is this not overruling the entire body of law about selective prosecution? Selective prosecution law is the court overseeing the Department of Justice with respect to how it is instituting and bringing cases. We just talked about -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- are they similarly situated people and are you acting improperly and in a discriminatory way? How is that whole body of law, which, by the way, just to be clear, the Supreme Court did not in its decision say it’s overruling. But how is it going to square the two? And one way to square it is to say, well, no, in this circumstance where you’re violating these sort of this separate constitutional provision. But if that’s the case, then the fact that you’re instituting a sham investigation of somebody, how is that not a violation of due process? But they said that it isn’t. So there’s a huge tension that I think the Jeff Clark motion gets at in terms of selective prosecution and how it’s going to survive, because even this Supreme Court, I don’t think is going to say we’re just getting rid of selective prosecution as a theory. I mean, their whole idea is that they are trying to denigrate the Department of Justice when they don’t like a prosecution. So it’s hard to see, though, theoretically how they’re going to deal with that problem. But I do think Jeffrey Clark, as much as I deplore what, assuming it’s proved and obviously the board found that he did do this and was reckless in the way he did it, but assuming that’s valid, you know what he did is so incredibly deplorable. But as a legal matter, he is right to raise this issue and it does point to a real tension and flaw in the Supreme Court decision. So anyway, Mary, that was my big picture. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: By the way, one of the reasons I’m going on and on and on about this is I’m waiting for you to tell me. No, no, no, relax, don’t worry. Mary McCord: Well, it’s an interesting concept. And I want to make sure I’m following you because you’re saying it’ll do away with selective prosecution as sort of a theory that a defendant could bring an argument there being selectively prosecuted. I’m actually thinking, doesn’t it just then essentially almost give a bunch of potential defendants the ability to say now this is selective because this other person, the president of the United States, is not going to be able to be prosecuted for these things that I’m going to be prosecuted for. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I think that would be harder because they’re not really similar situated, right. Mary McCord: Yeah, I agree. Andrew Weissmann: But I mean, it certainly is an unfairness. Mary McCord: There is an unfairness, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But sometimes that unfairness, as a friend of mine used to say, one of my mentors, life’s full of tough choices, you know, like there are lots of things that are unfair. But anyway, I really do think for our listeners, I know that the Jeffrey Clark thing is not a criminal case. I know that it’s coming up in the connection with a bar proceeding. But it’ll be really interesting to see because this is the kind of thing that Jeffrey Clark will get to take to a court to review how they’re going to deal with this issue. And obviously, Mark Meadows and other people who have been criminally charged will be making the same kind of arguments. Mary McCord: Yeah. I do think that, and they are, you know, they already are. We talked about Mark Meadows last week -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- and it’s going to keep coming. The floodgates keep opening or opening wider, I suppose. But at any rate, last point I was going to make on this is that it can’t be that that decision about presidential immunity is going to then immunize the entire executive branch of the United States for bad and illegal behavior or else we are really, really in trouble. Andrew Weissmann: In trouble. In trouble is the Mary McCord polite term. Mary McCord: Yeah. I’ve tried to not use, you know, foul language on our PG rated. Andrew Weissmann: In deep doo-doo. Mary McCord: Yes, exactly. The rule of law is dead, if that’s the case. So we can come back to that some other day. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So, Mary, should we break? We have a few things we wanted to just quickly cover, but then get to our listener questions. Mary McCord: Yes, we should. But after I say one more thing, which is that there is another type of fallout from this, which we teased at the top and which we will talk about a lot more on our episode with Steve Vladeck, our premium episode, which is one of the responses is this bill, the No Kings Act that’s been now introduced in Congress, that would essentially deprive the U.S. Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction to enforce immunity for a president for violating the criminal law and also deprive the court of reviewing the constitutionality of the No Kings Act, a very interesting comment. Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: Well said. So we’ll definitely get it. That is total preview for Monday. Should we take our break? Mary McCord: Okay. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. Before we turn to listener questions, and I have to keep this very brief because Andrew is definitely going to make sure we get to listener questions. Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: So Jenna Ellis, as folks know, was one of the attorneys that the Trump campaign used post-election in 2020 to file all kinds of frivolous lawsuits challenging the election results in various states. She’s actually been disciplined in some of those states, but she was also very involved in other efforts, including, you know, fraudulent electors scheme and other just general schemes to try to push the legislators in different states, Georgia, Arizona, elsewhere, to send up fraudulent slates of electors, et cetera. She has been charged, of course, and pleaded guilty in Georgia in return for her cooperation. Pleaded guilty to, I think, just a misdemeanor. And now we’ve heard that in Arizona, where she was also charged, that she has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Arizona attorney general, by which she’s not even having to plead guilty to anything at all. She’s getting all the charges, and I think there were nine charges against her dismissed in return for her cooperation there. Now, there are a number of defendants charged in Arizona, not as many, I guess, as in Georgia, but not Mr. Trump. This is a case where lots of others got brought into it, but not Mr. Trump. People like Giuliani, Boris Epstein, et cetera. So, that we will see what comes of that, if and when that prosecution actually starts getting to a stage of trial proceedings and how and in what ways she might be offering testimony there. But I will say, and we can talk about this longer on another day, that I think for Andrew and me, as longtime career prosecutors, we’ve been a little bit surprised at how favorably -- Andrew Weissmann: Lenient. Mary McCord: -- lenient, yes. Yes. The favorable deals that some of the state prosecutors have made with defendants in the cases against him, very favorable in Georgia and actually, you know, was even called not a crime of moral turpitude so that it wouldn’t affect her bar there. I mean, all kinds of things. And then not even having to plead guilty to anything in Arizona. So she better produce. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, when you decide what to offer somebody, there are all sorts of factors. How serious are the charges? What is the quality of the information the person is giving? At what stage are they cooperating? Is it really early on where you need to get a toehold and the information is really valuable? Have they pled guilty somewhere else and they’re going to be held accountable elsewhere? All of those go into the complicated decision about whether to charge somebody, what to require them to plead to if they want to cooperate. Obviously, the person doesn’t have to plead to anything. They can go to trial, but in terms of what you as a government prosecutor want to offer. And, you know, it’s very fact specific. But in this situation where especially the Georgia case, all of these are under this sort of first time offender rules in Georgia, where if you’re sort of good for the next year, essentially, it goes away. It’s like it’s not even on your record. And as you said, the judges recommended that it’s not a crime of moral turpitude so that you’re not sort of disbarred and lose your law license. So you do look to see whether the person is really, really cooperating in exchange for what it seems like a very lenient deal. With that, is it time? Mary McCord: It’s time. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Maybe I’ll read the first one and then paraphrase it and then turn it to you. We can go back and forth. So the first question we got is really interesting and it’s one that we’ve gotten from various people. And the question is, is impeachment null and void since impeachment is a mechanism provided within the Constitution to address accountability for high crimes and misdemeanors? Does the Supreme Court’s broad immunity decision for the president basically eliminate the possibility of any accountability through impeachment proceedings? That’s the question. Mary, what do you think? Mary McCord: No. Andrew Weissmann: Wow. Yeah. Okay. This is great because usually with lawyers, my answers are usually, well, it depends. Mary McCord: Yeah. But this is one where I do think it is pretty conclusively a no. And it would have been nice for the Supreme Court to say sort of more on this, but I actually think that their entire decision in many ways about immunity from criminal prosecution is based on a notion that there is a political remedy, which is impeachment. And the problem with that is that in today’s world, that remedy is just basically not available because of the partisanship now on Capitol Hill. I mean, if Congress, you know, was unable to actually have a successful impeachment conviction after January 6th, it’s hard to imagine when they would be able to agree. And remember, with respect to the impeachment trial after January 6th, the House had voted to impeach. Those articles impeachment were sent to the Senate where a trial was held. A majority of senators, including a number of Republicans, did vote to convict, but it has to be a two-thirds vote. So I think, you know, from just a not a legal argument, but just sort of placing the immunity decision in the context of how is accountability supposed to be handled in our constitutional scheme, the other main way is through impeachment and there’s nothing about the court’s decision that says that’s not available. And then the second thing I’d say with respect to that is that high crimes and misdemeanors in the impeachment clause, that existed before we even had a federal criminal code, before we even had state criminal codes. And so the high crimes and misdemeanors has really kind of always been what Congress determines it to be. They don’t really have to be things that, you know, they can point to a particular criminal code violation. They often do. But it’s the body of doctrine and law, you know, sort of on its own. So, I don’t see this as changing that from a legal perspective, but from a reality, it’s just very difficult these days. Andrew Weissmann: So I agree. Two quick thoughts. One, remember Mitch McConnell when he during the impeachment said, look, I’m not going to vote to convict, but you should remember there is both civil and criminal accountability for what happened. Well, not so much. Mary McCord: And a number of them then followed course -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- and said, the reason we’re not voting to convict is he can stand trial criminally, you know, if that is something that is warranted. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, not according to the Supreme Court. So the other is, remember, this is an immunity decision. It’s not saying it’s not a crime. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s saying the president’s criminally immune. So it doesn’t say he’s immune from impeachment, and it still is a crime. It’s just a question of immunity. So they didn’t say that, in fact, it’s not a crime. Okay. Mary McCord: All right. Question two. Because of Trump’s 34 felonies, of course, coming from the Manhattan case, will he be prevented from voting in the November election? Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So this is a matter of state law. So Donald Trump is a resident of Florida and so he would vote in Florida. And so each state can have different rules with respect to what happens if you are convicted of a crime and also what stage of the conviction and what the consequences are. There’s a whole movement right now essentially to eradicate sort of felony disenfranchisement. So just because you’ve been convicted of a felony that you shouldn’t be forever barred from voting. And so under Florida law, it’s kind of complicated. But my understanding is under Florida law, he would be able to vote for himself in the November election. You know, the big picture is we’re a country where apparently one major party thinks it’s fine to put on the ballot somebody who’s been convicted of 34 felony counts. And we may see in the middle of September, September 18th, Judge Merchan in the Manhattan case may very well, depending on what he decides on some pending motions, may very well be sentencing Donald Trump in September. So he will really be convicted at that point and sentenced. He may not get jail time. He may get jail time, but not be required to start serving it. But he should be allowed under Florida law to still vote for himself. Mary McCord: And I believe, isn’t it New York law that says you can vote even if you’ve been convicted unless you’re actually serving a sentence. So I suppose theoretically, if you were in, you know, prison on November 5th, that would be a barrier, but I think that’s unlikely. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, there’s a related question, which is about postponing sentencing from a listener in Minnesota, very much in the news this morning, writing to ask why Justice Marchand postponed sentencing until after Trump’s immunity status in the case was ascertained. The trial is over. His guilt is a matter of record. Why is the Supreme Court decision retroactive? I have something to say on this, but I’m going to turn to you, Mary. Mary McCord: Okay. That’s a great question. Andrew Weissmann: Great. Mary McCord: And, yeah, it is. And this comes up in lots of other areas, too, when the law changes, you know, right after somebody is found guilty. And basically, the way the law works is that until it is final, so a case is not final until you’ve exhausted all of your appeals or all the time has run to take appeals and you haven’t taken appeals. And until then, if the law changes, you can take advantage of that change in the law and make an argument on appeal or in front, in this case, in front of the trial court judge because you’re not even yet up on appeal, that you should have a different result based on that change in the law. And so that’s the posture that we find ourselves in with respect to the Manhattan case, you know, after the guilty verdicts, but before sentencing. And you can’t even have an appeal until after sentencing. We have this change in the law with respect to immunity. And that is why Judge Merchan, you know, agreed to kind of hold up and allow briefing on this issue of whether and if so, how the immunity decision should impact the verdicts here. This is to be distinct from, for example, people whose convictions have long been final and there’s a new change in the law 20 years later and they come in and say, oh, I should get a new trial based on this change in the law. In those situations, it is extraordinarily rare that decisions of the Supreme Court are retroactive. It occasionally is the case and that’s the subject for a deep dive into, you know, law school level 200. Andrew Weissmann: That’s not even 2.0. That’s like 3.0. Mary McCord: That’s right. But that’s exceedingly rare. But we’re not in that situation here. Andrew Weissmann: So I think there is an argument with respect to the issue before Judge Merchan, where remember, the issue is the preclusion of official act evidence in a case that is unofficial because the rationale was, in part at least, that you don’t want to deter the sort of vigorous discussion and actions of the president. But the Hope Hicks testimony that we talked about, for instance, that’s already happened. There’s already been that conversation. And so the issue of applying that backwards to this trial, there’s no harm. In other words, it’s a new rule. I agree completely with your analysis of the way retroactivity law works. It’s just that there’s no reason to say it should apply here because it’s really a question of going forward -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- because this has all happened in the past. So you don’t have to worry about you want to deter this going forward. Mary McCord: Right. We can’t deter. You know, you can’t put the milk back in the bottle to the extent that any future president or anyone else would be deterred. That already happened. Andrew Weissmann: Right. So I didn’t see that in the D.A.’s brief, but I do think it’s a valid argument with respect to the long Hope Hicks discussion we had the other day on that. Okay, so, Mary, we’re going to get to more listener questions in future episodes because we just got so many really good ones. But we do have one last question. Mary McCord: Yes. Okay. This is from someone in Dallas who says, I am an 84-year-old granny in Dallas, went into the Peace Corps when JFK was president. Clean for Gene. You get the idea. Andrew Weissmann: Clean for Gene? I am old enough. You know what that’s a reference to? Gene McCarthy, 1968 presidential campaign. Mary McCord: Our listener says every time I listen to your podcast, I’m sorry that class is over too soon. Only in the past few weeks, I have relearned that persons appointed to the Supreme Court do not have to be attorneys. They do not even have to be college graduates. Here’s my question. Do you think that we could do just as well if the Supreme Court was made up entirely of nine childless cat ladies? Andrew, yes or no? Andrew Weissmann: Is this when I get to say it depends? Mary McCord: Yes, exactly. I think this is where we can say it depends. I don’t have the legal answer to that. Andrew Weissmann: So that is a great question and thank you. Shout out to the 84-year-old granny in Dallas. Wonderful childless cat lady question. So great note to end on, because there’s so much news and a lot of what we were talking about today doesn’t speak well for the Supreme Court decision and all of its ramifications. Tons to keep an eye out for. Obviously, everyone’s very focused on the politics right now, but there’s a lot going on in the legal front that Mary and I are happy to be able to chat with each other and all of you.

This Trump campaign post revives a racist American tradition,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 3:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-war-room-tweet-racist-rcna166639,"In an effort to boost its election hopes, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is drawing on the U.S.’s disturbing history of explicitly racist and xenophobic imagery.  On Tuesday, the ""Trump War Room"" account on X, which is run by the campaign, shared an unabashedly racist image that suggested if Kamala Harris is elected president, American neighborhoods will be overrun with hordes of Black people and immigrants.  “Import the third world/become the third world,” the post read, contrasting an image of a serene suburban neighborhood (in which no people are visible) with a photo depicting a huddled mass of mostly Black men crowded together on a city sidewalk. The essence of this post — that Black people, perhaps Black immigrants in particular, ought to be feared and rejected — is so grotesque and old-timey in its racism that it harks back to an era when such imagery was commonplace in mainstream American politics: the Jim Crow era.  In fact, whether it’s this post, the signs at Trump rallies (and the national convention!) calling for “Mass Deportation Now” or cartoons shared by Trump and his followers that depict Black people with darkened skin and nonhuman features, the Trump campaign is reviving the ugly American tradition of deploying unmistakably racist and xenophobic imagery as part of its political vocabulary — the type of stuff one might expect to see in the Ku Klux Klan’s Fiery Cross newspaper more than a half-century ago.  Here, for example, is a cartoon published in the Fiery Cross that depicted immigrants as “trash” and “undesirables.” That’s not so dissimilar to the message sent by the Trump campaign’s “third world” post or Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants’ being “vermin.” And here’s another cartoon published in that same newspaper, depicting Uncle Sam slamming the door shut on immigrants. “Whose country is this anyway?” the caption reads. The KKK's motto at the time it was sharing these images was literally ""America First,"" a phrase Trump and his followers have adopted as their own and used throughout his political career. Another ad from the pro-segregation Mothers’ League of Central High School in the 1950s called on voters to reject the historic push to desegregate the school in Little Rock, Arkansas, and support segregationists. “If the integrationists win this school board fight, the schools will be integrated this fall. There will be absolutely nothing you or we can do to stop it,” the flier warns. “DO YOU WANT NEGROES IN OUR SCHOOLS?”  The Trump War Room post on Tuesday is stoking those same bigoted fears about changing neighborhoods, fears that have never truly gone away, with imagery and rhetoric that are just as blatant as they were a hundred years ago."
Democrats need to rethink their strategies about young voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/young-voters-are-not-nearly-radical-made-rcna165771,"It appears the remaining old guy in the 2024 presidential race is trying hard not to make age his most obvious problem. Former President Donald Trump, who once led the charge to ban TikTok, in early June joined the platform where nearly a third of people under 30 are most likely to get their news. Since joining, he’s amassed 10 million followers with videos such as a mock face-off with boxer and provocateur Jake Paul and a decontextualized mashup of Vice President Kamala Harris calling 18- to 24-year-olds “stupid” (from a 2014 talk advocating for the rehabilitation of  juvenile offenders).  Trump is understandably trying to court young people to the political party that has long struggled to win their favor. Few lawmakers  — and zero House Republicans, according to July reporting by NPR — are on TikTok. That’s more on brand for younger, progressive politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and before that, Barack Obama, whose technological savvy and informal communication style aligned with their democratic, forward-thinking politics. Trump’s online vibe reads more anti-institutional than egalitarian, but his appeals to younger Americans, especially males, are not in vain: Data, and anecdotal observations, show that young voters’ consistent support for Democrats is becoming less assured. Gallup calculates that 18- to 29-year-olds prefer Democrats by a slimmer margin than we’ve seen since 2005. If this pattern holds, it will be the first election year since 2000 that the party hasn’t enjoyed a double-digit advantage among this cohort. The same survey projects that the Democratic Party would be at a deficit among the next youngest group, 30-49 years old, for the first presidential election year since 2004. Other pollsters caveat the difficulty of capturing youth voting preferences, but have noted a significant decline in support for the Democratic ticket and a boost for Trump. Last month, The New York Times warned of “the GOP convention looking awfully young” while The Free Press reported on “Zoomers turning MAGA.” Democrats, on the other hand, have been smashing fundraising records on Zoom meetings organized around so-called identitarian groupings. But they should be wary about overdetermining such categories, including around age. Stanford University’s recent program “America in One Room,” which gathered more than 400 prospective first-time voters to discuss their varying political views face to face, rather than via the more commonly available — and more anonymous — online forums, suggests that young people hold a wide range of political beliefs. And that they are eager to connect with each other across their differences in service of a better, shared future. In short: Democrats are going to have to work harder than usual to capture the support of young people they can usually count on — or at least count on not to vote Republican. As a professor and parent who interacts with young people daily, and as a historian of American political culture, I’m skeptical that a MAGA surge is afoot among our youngest voting citizens, who are deeply concerned with issues like climate change and social inequality, planks of the Democratic platform. But if conjuring a future of revanchist frat bros and aspiring ""tradwives"" is an unlikely political vision, so too is its funhouse mirror image that, to our peril, often dominates popular depictions of young progressives: dogmatic left-wing radicals who glorify violence, fixate on identity and view America as irredeemable. Rather than take this characterization for granted, Democrats should focus on offering young people an optimistic, forward-looking vision of how their administration can make good on America’s unfulfilled promise for a more equally shared prosperity. Trust me, I know firsthand this segment of the left exists among young potential voters, especially since campus protests took place following Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s ongoing military attacks in Gaza. And even as a vocal contingent of students occupied buildings, dominated meeting agendas and drained university resources, it became clear that a significant number of students felt aggressed, or even just extremely annoyed by such antics, yet were uncomfortable speaking out. Contrary to popular impressions, all college students do not embrace this brand of political progressivism, and there is no reason to believe most young people subscribe to the beliefs we’ve seen covered in the media.  To remain on my own campus, The New School, for just a moment: It has been clear that, even at a liberal arts college in New York City’s Greenwich Village neighborhood, not all students are uniformly progressive, nor did their time on our campus and in our classrooms drive them leftward. On the contrary. One of my students reflected that she remembered arriving at college in 2020 and being made to “feel like a bad person” because she craved “seeing peoples’ faces without masks.” Another reflected, “Can you believe I used to be one of those kids who posted ACAB [all cops are bad]?,” in disbelief he had once parroted such slogans, a perspective that had become more nuanced due to his time discussing such issues, and living in New York City, where public safety directly affected him. A political education, especially in fraught times, can, and should, operate in multiple directions, and the Democrats would do well to speak to potential voters like these students who are thinking critically about progressivism rather than proclaiming its most popular slogans most loudly.  Such quiet disaffection with the most vocal and visible progressive perspectives is hard to capture but is important for Democrats to remember, for it challenges a common refrain that to attract younger voters, the party must move leftward. “Silent majority,” with its Nixonian echoes, is a tempting but imprecise term to use for this group that in many ways is upset about the perceived erosion of liberal mores: respectful dialogue, cultural pluralism, the importance of higher education, and of the pursuit of the unfulfilled American project.  If any generalization about young people holds true, it might be that they resist the imposition of dominant ideas. Thus, it makes sense that the “F Trump” sensibility that so galvanized Democratic support among young people in 2016 and 2020 is less passionate, as it has become at least nominally institutionalized in many educational institutions like the one where I work. To young people who have now spent a good chunk of their teen years hearing, often from powerful people like celebrities or educators, that resisting Trump is the morally correct position, acting otherwise at the ballot box and in their lives might carry an enticing whiff of rebellion, even as his policies all but ensure a darker future for all of us.  Democrats would do well to make crystal clear why young people who care about, and want to contribute to, the future of this nation can count on the party, with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at its helm, to support them. To do anything else only stands to entrench our political polarization more dangerously for a generation to come, by  keeping desperately needed young people away from voting Democratic, or away from the polls entirely."
Why Harris’ polls performance might be more than a ‘honeymoon’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/election-2024-trump-harris-swing-states-poll-numbers-rcna166610,"Since she catapulted to the top of the Democrats’ ticket last month, Vice President Kamala Harris has been quickly closing the gap with former President Donald Trump in polls. After President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, it was looking like Democrats would be routed. Harris has essentially made it a tied race again. The big question, though, is whether her campaign’s momentum can be sustained till November and, crucially, if it translates into votes in the states that will decide the election. There’s reason for Democrats to be hopeful. A New York Times/Siena College poll released this week shows major gains from Harris in three key swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. According to the survey, Harris now leads Trump in those states by 4 percentage points — 50% to 46% — among likely voters. That is within the margin of error for all three states, but those numbers are significant given Biden’s deficit last month. We’re seeing the same thing happen in three other swing states. In Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, Harris is either leading or tied with Trump, according to a survey released this week by The Cook Political Report. Things are also swinging Harris’ way in the national polls, according to an aggregate from FiveThirtyEight. A recent Substack article from Nate Silver highlighted how much of a shift this has been compared to last month, with Harris climbing almost 12 points in Arizona polls. (For the record, NBC News hasn’t released a national survey since Biden dropped out, but in its most recent poll conducted in July, in a then-hypothetical question about what voters might do if Biden discontinued his campaign, Harris was running behind Trump, 47% to 45%, with a margin of error of 3.46%.) It remains true that polls don’t tell the whole story and that there’s a risk in Democrats’ thinking that Harris has Trump cornered. Among those reportedly trying to tamp down the enthusiasm is Trump’s top pollster, Tony Fabrizio, as his boss has started to fret about Harris’ surge. “Mr. Fabrizio has predicted to campaign colleagues that Ms. Harris will have another two to three good weeks, through the Democratic National Convention, and then her poll numbers will turn in the other direction,” The New York Times reports. There’s a solid bit of wisdom baked into Fabrizio’s claims that can’t be dismissed as pure cope. It’s been well documented that a post-convention polling bounce exists, one that often provides a greater benefit for the candidate whose party goes second. Notably, the effect has dwindled over the years, as polarization has hardened voters’ partisan preferences. And as with all things election-related, there’s plenty that can happen between the nomination and Election Day that could send polls spiraling topsy-turvy again. But here’s the thing: We don’t have to take the most recent polling in isolation. Instead, we can compare the latest NYT/Siena results to a poll that the partners conducted last year, when Biden was still in the running and underwater in those key states. In October, Trump led Biden among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup by 5 points in Michigan and 6 points in Pennsylvania, while Biden had a 2-point advantage in Wisconsin. When asked about whether they would support an unnamed Democratic candidate over Trump, things shifted. Trump lost that imaginary contest in each state: 48%-41% in Michigan, 50%-40% in Pennsylvania and 51% to 39% in Wisconsin. That tracked with more recent polling that found that Biden was running behind other Democrats before exiting the race, failing to catch up with Trump even as other candidates’ numbers showed the strength of the party’s messaging. Biden supporters rightly noted then that it’s much easier to support a generic candidate than a real politician with actual positions and a record to critique. Importantly, though, the October NYT/Siena survey also polled respondents about a hypothetical matchup between Trump and Harris. At the time, Harris trailed Trump in those three states by 1 to 3 percentage points. This direct comparison suggests a continuity at work here. It wasn’t a given that Harris would find herself performing as well as or better than the generic Democrat voters were asked about in last year’s survey. For her to have taken the lead among likely voters in those swing states demonstrates that there’s more at work here than mere relief that Biden is out. Her numbers also undercut the assumption that Harris is enjoying an unsustainable boost after replacing Biden. Instead, as NBC News recently reported, her campaign is doing the work to ensure that this surge in enthusiasm is being converted into a veritable army of volunteers. The presidential race is still probably going to be a close one, in which a handful of states decide the victor. It’s much more likely to be a roller coaster between now and November. But there’s little reason to assume Harris’ current momentum owes to a “honeymoon” period that will wane long before the election, not when the polls showed so clearly that voters were seeking someone other than Biden to take on Trump."
The Marion newspaper raid highlights the bravery of small-town journalists,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 3:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kansas-newspaper-getting-justice-illegal-police-raid-rcna166409,"A year after he led a fateful raid on the office of the Marion County, Kansas, Record newspaper and its publisher’s home, former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody was finally charged with a crime. A government’s attacking the free press cannot be tolerated, so it’s encouraging that in a time when journalists are routinely maligned and threatened, the special prosecutors assigned to the case charged Cody with wrongdoing, specifically interference with the judicial process. They say the chief asked a woman — whose driving record the newspaper had been looking into — to delete incriminating text messages they’d exchanged with one another. It’s a low-level felony, but Cody’s not being charged with anything would have dishonored the memory of the 98-year-old co-owner of the Record, Joan Meyer, who yelled “Get out of my house!” to police raiding her home. She died the next day from what her family says was the stress of the encounter. Though prosecutors didn’t pin Meyer’s death on the police and their raid, the newspaper’s publisher, Eric Meyer, in a lawsuit links Cody’s actions to his mother’s death. The raid on the Record is a reminder that small-town journalists are among the bravest in the field. Exposing the scandals of heads of state and corporate titans is a low-risk, high-reward venture compared with calling out the misdeeds of, say, the winning football coach-turned-school board member or the beloved boy-done-good contractor. Especially when you know you’ll run into them or somebody close to them at the grocery store or the middle school band recital. Marion has an estimated 1,900 people, Marion County about 12,000. To conduct professional journalism in such small places takes a fearlessness that most journalists will never have to muster. Based on a tip, the Record was looking into whether a local restaurateur’s DUI and record of a suspended license disqualified her from getting a liquor license. A Record reporter obtained the woman’s publicly available driving record. The paper didn't run a story based on those records, but then the police (emboldened by a warrant that should never have been signed) decided that journalists examining public records had committed identity theft. In his lawsuit, the newspaper’s publisher, who’s also a college journalism professor, accuses the mayor of prompting the police chief to investigate the newspaper. Two weeks before the fateful raid, according to reporting by the news sites Kansas Reflector and The Handbasket, the mayor of Marion had said in a Facebook post on his personal page that the “real villains in America ... are the radical ‘journalists,’ ‘teachers’ and ‘professors’ who do nothing but sow division between the American people.” The police chief resigned in October when NBC affiliate KSHB of Kansas City reported that he had told the restaurant owner to erase the text messages they’d exchanged. The mayor decided against seeking re-election. The attack on the Record is also a reminder that small-town newspapers are disappearing, and fast. According to a November report from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern, the loss of 2.5 local newspapers a week last year means “more than half of all U.S. counties now have limited access to reliable local news and information.” That report found that 228 more counties are “at high risk of losing local news.” The disappearance of local news not only leaves people more in the dark about what’s happening around them, but it also foments the kind of cutthroat partisanship that we’ve seen play out at school board meetings and city council meetings. If the only news people get concerns Democrats and Republicans in Washington fighting tooth and nail, then they’re more likely to filter everything local through the same polarizing lens. My journalism career began at a weekly newspaper not unlike the Marion Record, and the first crime story I wrote made me aware that journalism wasn’t as safe as I’d assumed. I quoted the sheriff in my part of rural Mississippi boasting of his department’s recovery of stolen goods at an unnamed pawnshop. The exceedingly large owner of another local pawnshop felt wrongly implicated and wanted an audience with me, the 17-year-old summer intern. As my editor was describing how he’d previously burst through the door yelling — and promising to order me to hide if she saw him approaching — I saw her eyes focus on the door behind me, and she said, “Oh, my God, here he comes!” From my hiding place, I heard her explain that the sheriff had declined to give the name of the pawn shop, and I heard him vow to come back and raise hell if the sheriff didn’t confirm what she said. There was no warning the next time. The office stood frozen as he threw the door open, stuck his head inside and said the sheriff had confirmed what she’d said and that he no longer had it out for me. In the decades since, I’ve written things that have upset big-city mayors, governors and members of Congress. But I can attest, as I’m sure Meyer can, that offending high-ranking officials is nothing compared to getting crosswise with local small-town potentates. The good news is that the readership of the Record has tripled since the raid: from 2,000 subscribers to 6,000. Still, Meyer is seeking $5 million in his lawsuit and says he doesn’t want to settle. He wants a precedent-setting verdict against those behind the raid. He said"" “The whole point of doing this is not to get money. The whole point of doing this is to say ‘you can’t do this crap.’”"
Republicans are stuck with Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 2:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republicans-stuck-donald-trump-democrats-rcna166597,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" The Republican Party is stuck with Donald Trump. Now, they won’t say that publicly and they didn’t feel that way three weeks ago when many Republicans were talking about winning New Jersey and thinking about what jobs they would have in the second Trump administration. But a lot has changed since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the Democratic side of the ticket. Trump is now losing a race that he was clearly winning before.  Let’s not overstate things. Trump is behind in the national polling lead and he’s behind in the key swing states but all of the leads are narrow. The race is still — because of the nature of American politics — close. As we have just seen in the last three weeks, things can change radically very quickly.            One of the themes of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s short-lived presidential campaign still rings prescient. Haley frequently said that most Americans did not want a Trump-Biden rematch. She even predicted, “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.” Remember that line? There was some real insight there. And it’s transferred to what you see in the polls. Trump is now the oldest man to run for a four-year term as president. He’s older today than Ronald Reagan was when he left office. And Trump has been doing the exact same shtick since 2015. He is very obviously deteriorating in terms of his capacity and his energy — as we saw in his glitchy, rambling, difficult-to-understand audio conversation with Elon Musk on Monday. During that conversation, Trump delivered important public policy messages to the American people like: That appearance was the culmination of a three-week stretch in which Trump still attacked Biden, who, remember, is no longer running against him. He spread downright ludicrous and comical conspiracy theories falsely claiming the Harris campaign faked the size of its crowds with artificial intelligence. He suggested she only became a Black person recently, which is a racist lie, but also a weird product of a brain that’s been scrambled like eggs. Trump is the same guy he’s always been. Yet, Republicans still think he’s capable of being someone else entirely. I have, personally, covered seemingly hundreds of “new tone for Donald Trump” news cycles over all those years. Most recently, we heard it after he survived a genuinely terrifying assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. In the lead-up to the Republican National Convention, we heard that he’d changed. He’d mellowed. He was all about unity. As one convention delegate told reporters, “The real estate salesman, I think, is a different person. ... It’s a good thing. Humility goes a long way in politics and it attracts far more people ... I think he’s seeing God.” Sound familiar? Haven’t we been hearing this stuff for the better part of a decade? Like when CNN’s Van Jones praised Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, claiming he “became president of the United States in that moment, period.” Seven years. We’ve been doing this for seven years. At this point, it’s like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  And yet, if you listen to what Republican insiders are still telling reporters, they want Trump to do a pivot. They want him to be more disciplined. They want him to be more presidential. And this time, it will be for real.  This week, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Trump should stop questioning the size of Harris’ crowds at rallies and focus on the issues.  Fox Business host Larry Kudlow and former Trump aide turned Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway shared a similar sentiment, practically begging the former president to stay on message. And former Vice President Mike Pence had to remind his party that they can win “at every level by speaking the truth to [voters] respectfully.” “I have some familiarity with that; I did it for four years,” Pence said. The former vice president was threatened with hanging for it, but yes, he kept it respectful. Pence of all people should know you can’t change Trump. Yet people keep falling into the same old trap.  Even the people who joined the Trump 2024 bandwagon at its peak right after the convention. Some of those supporters showed up to a Trump fundraiser earlier this month on Long Island, including billionaire hedge funders like Bill Ackman. According to The New York Times, at the dinner that evening: I’ll say this for Trump: He has more awareness about himself than a shocking number of people in Republican politics. He won’t change.  Do you know who else understands this? Voters. Like the ones in a focus group held after Trump’s first joint address to Congress and the nation as president in 2017. The one that pundits like Jones called so “presidential.” One voter told CBS News, “That is no way the real Donald Trump. The real Donald Trump will surface in probably less than two hours.” Another said the next thing Trump needed to do was “delete his Twitter feed.”  When asked if they did not like the way Trump behaved on Twitter, almost the entire room raised their hands.  In advance of Monday's Twitter show with Musk, Trump got back to posting on the site. You know, the platform he was kicked off of for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. Meanwhile, the Democrats have something new — an open horizon in front of them as they enter a convention united, with a popular energetic ticket and a messaging opportunity that we have not seen in our lifetimes.

The GOP war on abortion has only led to higher abortion rates,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rising-abortion-rates-post-roe-policies-rcna166577,"“My goal, and the goal of many of those joining me here today, is to make abortion at any stage a thing of the past.” That line, spoken nearly 12 years ago by Texas’ then-Gov. Rick Perry while he was stumping outside a Houston-area anti-abortion pregnancy center, has been on my mind a lot over the past few days, thanks to new evidence showing more people are having abortions today than before Donald Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The latest Society of Family Planning #WeCount report shows in-person and telehealth abortion care with clinical supervision have increased, and new research out of the University of California-San Francisco shows self-managed abortion care is also becoming more common post-Roe. As a means of eliminating abortion in the United States, the Dobbs decision and the resulting proliferation of state-level abortion restrictions and bans seem to have failed spectacularly. Today, Rick Perry’s political career is more a “thing of the past” than is abortion care. But I am not given to believe that eliminating abortion was ever the goal of the anti-abortion movement or of the Republican (and some Democrat) politicians who have backed abortion bans and sought to criminalize care.  It’s more clear than ever — and it’s been plenty clear for a while — that anti-abortion politics and policies are about punishment, predominantly for perceived noncompliance with Christian, patriarchal sexual customs. Rhetoric around eliminating abortion, more recently couched by anti-abortion propagandists as making abortion “unthinkable,” is a smokescreen. It’s intended to divert attention away from the deeply misogynist, oppressive heart of anti-abortion thinking and policymaking, which are primarily concerned with writing the subjugation of pregnant people into law. The sooner the public — including the Beltway press and mainstream and legacy journalists, pundits and public intellectuals — get their heads around this, the better positioned we’ll all be to stamp out the GOP’s sexist chicanery and get moving on pro-abortion-rights and pro-family policies that will really make positive differences in people’s lives. But I worry we’re still a long way away. I was struck by a recent column in The Hill by the conservative law professor Andrew Koppelman, who wrote that “pro-life voters, who want more than anything else to minimize the number of abortions,” should vote for Kamala Harris. Now, sure: anyone whose goal is to “minimize” abortions would do well to support practically any Democrat over practically any Republican. Dems have long backed common-sense policies that enable people to make decisions about their reproductive lives that are less likely to result in unplanned pregnancies, from improving contraceptive access to promoting evidence-based sex education. And of course, Democrats also back the safety-net policies and institutions that are more likely to enable people who want to become pregnant and experience parenthood to do so.    But presuming “pro-life voters” are those who “want more than anything else to minimize the number of abortions” begs the question to an incredible, even irresponsible, degree. Voters — and politicians — who oppose abortion have had the same opportunities anyone else does to support access to contraception, sex education, and safety-net programs. But, again and again, they’ve chosen not to. Perhaps they have other priorities — such as enriching America’s modern-day robber barons, attacking transgender kids and adults, or accelerating climate disaster to the benefit of the oil and gas industry. Even then, ushering in climate change and supporting bodily autonomy are hardly mutually exclusive. There’s plainly another motivation at play here: rank misogyny. The regressive, conservative desire to control strangers’ sexual behavior — especially women’s sexual behavior and our reproductive capacities — makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than the knotty mental gymnastics required to reconcile crowing about making abortion “unthinkable” with voting against the Right to Contraception Act. That people who do not wish to remain pregnant at the behest of the government have found the means to do so even after the fall of Roe is a testament to the ingenuity, resilience and resourcefulness of pregnant people themselves, and of the reproductive health, rights and justice movements and their political supporters, and especially of local abortion funds. Despite the closure of hundreds of clinics between the onset of TRAP laws in the early 2010s and the Dobbs decision, medical providers — notably, mostly independent clinics — have done all they can to stretch their capacity in places where abortion remains legal. Telemedicine shield laws are keeping options open for folks living in the most abortion-hostile geographies. Doulas, educators, accompaniers and other supporters of safe self-managed abortion care are sharing information despite the odds, and at great legal risk. But we should not assume the new data from SFP and UCSF means that everyone who needs an abortion can get one or can get care by the means they would prefer. There will always be abortions, and there always should be abortions, as many as are necessary to ensure that people have complete control over their reproductive lives. Even with abortion numbers going up, that’s not the case. We’re in a new status quo, and it’s totally unacceptable, and untenable in the long term (and the long term could be shorter than we think, with a Trump-Vance presidential ticket on the line). We know that, post-Dobbs, tens of thousands of people are likely being forced to carry pregnancies to term when they would have chosen otherwise. Infant deaths are on the rise, with thousands of families navigating terrible, and unnecessary, trauma and grief as a direct result of abortion bans. So-called “exceptions” to abortion bans, for rape or incest or medical emergencies, are demonstrably inadequate; even people with unviable ectopic pregnancies are being turned away by medical facilities unwilling to run afoul of abortion bans. Forced pregnancy, rising infant deaths and the despicable treatment of pregnant people seeking urgent medical care have one thing in common, and it isn’t reducing abortion: it’s the anti-abortion movement’s sadistic obsession with the subjugation of women."
Donald Trump's anti-worker rhetoric could help Kamala Harris win the White House,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 1:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-musk-harris-walz-union-workers-rcna166617,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight.” On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held his first solo campaign event since joining the Democratic ticket. Walz addressed one of the country’s largest public sector unions, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  For years now, unions have been big fans of Walz. As governor of Minnesota, he banned noncompete agreements and guaranteed paid sick days for workers. He made it so companies can’t force workers to attend meetings where they argue against unionizing. The guy has even joined picket lines. The reason I bring all of this up is because it stands in sharp contrast to how the other side of this race thinks about labor.  On Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sat for a livestreamed interview with the billionaire owner of Tesla and the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk. In the past few years alone, Musk has fired nearly 80% of Twitter’s workforce. He’s also been found liable in court for illegally firing a Tesla worker who was trying to form a union.  During his conversation with Musk, Trump offered his take on those job cuts, calling Musk “the greatest cutter.” “I mean, I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t mention the name of the company — but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK, you’re all gone.’” On Tuesday, the United Auto Workers union filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk for that statement. The group’s president put out a statement that said, bluntly, “When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean.” The United Auto Workers has already endorsed Harris. With their backing — and the backing of other labor organizations like the UAW — the Harris-Walz campaign may just be able to buttress the ""blue wall"" and win in November.

No one should confuse the enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for a lack of substance.  Harris knows her stuff. She knows where this country needs to go. I’m sure her campaign will lay out detailed policy positions very soon. Those policies will be posted to her website, for the American people to research and think about for themselves.  But Harris needs to be careful here. As a former Democratic senator, I know all too well the trap members of my party sometimes fall into. Democrats think, well, if I can just give one more detail about how we’re going to convert green energy into jobs or if I could just give the voters one more in-the-weeds factoid then that will do it. However, that approach will not appeal to the people who will decide who takes the White House. These people are not high-information voters. Many of the voters who will actually decide this election likely won’t pay attention until the final 60 days of the campaign. So while Harris has to have that substance ready to go, she also needs to keep her campaign where it is now in terms of messaging — “We’re not going back. We’re going forward. This is about you and it’s not about him.” That is what will likely convince the voters that Harris needs to win the White House in November.

MAGA podcaster Royce White's primary win is disastrous for Minnesota Republicans,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 12:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/royce-white-republican-minnesota-senate-primary-win-rcna166607,"On Tuesday night, Minnesota Republicans sealed their fate as a pro-extremist party when they officially voted for bigoted podcaster Royce White as their nominee for one of Minnesota's Senate seats. The win is a political comeback of sorts for White, who waged a failed GOP primary bid in 2022 in the race to represent Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, a seat held by Rep. Ilhan Omar. But White’s win this year arguably makes a GOP loss in the Senate race more likely.  White defeated Joe Fraser, who was running as a more mainstream, normal-sounding Republican — who, Fraser argued, would give the party a chance in the general election against incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar.  White, on the other hand, is a former college basketball player who had a cup of coffee in the NBA before dropping out of the league over a conflict around his anxiety disorder. He’s since become an internet-based conspiracy theorist and the host of an aptly titled podcast, “Please, Call Me Crazy.” White (who is Black) is a mentee of far-right Trump adviser Steve Bannon and sees himself as a MAGA evangelist in Bannon’s hapless effort to lure Black men toward conservative Republicanism. One of the ways White has sought to do that is through rank misogyny. I wrote earlier this year about how White went viral over comments he made in a resurfaced podcast interview with Bannon, in which White claimed women have become “too mouthy” these days. Politically speaking, White is a walking red flag who is likely to provide his opponent with what seems like a library’s worth of sound bites to work with in the coming months. That includes his use of homophobic and misogynistic slurs to attack people online, his antisemitic rhetoric, his embrace of 9/11 conspiracy theories, and it's possible that his use of campaign funds at a Miami strip club in 2022 could come up. All these things were widely known before Tuesday. But a plurality of GOP voters in Minnesota rejected Fraser's electability argument. Instead, they selected an outspoken devotee of Donald Trump’s hypermasculine cult of personality, spurning the moderate candidate who might have given them a puncher’s chance at winning a Senate seat this fall."
Is the Harris-Walz campaign making political merch great again?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 11:04 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-camo-hat-rcna166260,"During the 2016 election, I recall sitting on the beach with friends in a Jersey Shore town that was split down the middle between Republicans and Democrats. Someone told a joke: “How can you spot a Trump supporter?” The punchline: “Because they’ll show you.” The person was referring, of course, to the bright red ""Make America Great Again"" baseball hat that had just made political and cultural landfall. Today, the accessory is as ubiquitous as ever. While fashion has long been a medium to express personal ideology, political or otherwise, the MAGA hat ushered in something different. What may have begun as merely political support for a presidential candidate became a salient symbol of exclusion, divisiveness and an invitation for heated debate. There is no single item that is more of a political and cultural juggernaut than the MAGA hat. But now it could have a challenger. A $40 camouflage baseball hat baring HARRIS WALZ in orange, boldfaced print sold out in 30 minutes last week. As of Thursday, sales reportedly totaled nearly $2 million including pre-order sales. I’m sure that number has since grown. Singer Bon Iver wore one to perform at a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I saw at least one on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. For certain Americans in liberal enclaves across the country, the cap is already a status symbol. Not to evoke Harris’ most viral moment to date, but the camo hat exists in a cultural context, joining a trend that is already seeing an incredible upswing. While camouflage never truly exits the general fashion milieu, it’s enjoying a real moment. This is especially true for men’s fashion, so-called Carhartt-core, in its embrace of ‘90s-era military trends and a subversion of traditionally masculine pieces that perpetually exist outside of high-end fashion. (Look at any TikTok fluent Angeleno or Bushwick transplant for some combination of white ribbed tank top, oversized well-worn jacket, and heavy, silver chain jewelry.) This aesthetic, camouflage baseball cap included, originated as practical and durable workwear for blue-collar Americans — a voting bloc that has been steadily leaving the Democratic Party since at least 2012. Walz’s place in the Harris campaign is clear: He is to be that Midwest everyman, that average-above-average working-class guy. And by, all accounts, he genuinely is. Walz even wore a black T-shirt, sneakers and, yes, a camouflage baseball cap, in the campaign video commemorating his place as a Harris’ vice presidential pick. The choice has sparked a lot of notable reactions. Meghan McCain, daughter of the late politician John McCain, seemed to read it as a grab for working-class voters, posting on X: “Putting someone in a camo hat doesn’t make them a moderate or appealing to red-state people. No one is that dumb.” That statement can be picked apart in another article, but it’s worth noting that even if McCain’s jaded assessment of the cap were entirely true, it still is an embrace of “red-state people,” as she calls them. That alone separates it from the inherent exclusivity of the MAGA hat. Then there’s Chappell Roan. The Missouri-born 26-year-old singer has emerged as the breakout star of the summer. Chappell Roan, already a cultural, fashion and LGBTQ+ icon in her own right, famously rejected an invitation to the White House to perform for a Pride celebration, citing her belief in “freedom in trans rights, that means freedom in women’s rights, and it especially means freedom for all oppressed people in occupied territories.” The official merch for her “Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess Tour”: a camouflage baseball with hat orange, boldfaced embroidered letters spelling “Midwest Princess.” In an alternate reality, in a timeline where the Harris-Walz campaign hadn’t already proven to be extraordinarily meme-literate and internet savvy, perhaps this camo baseball hat would merely be a bid to appeal to those lost working-class voters and a true celebration of Walz’s Midwestern background. We aren’t in that timeline. On the one hand, this hat is confirmation that the Harris-Walz campaign understands the social currency of trends and the power of virality. On the other, it signals, yet again, that the campaign is dedicated to appealing to the sprawling Gen-Z voting bloc. Many a political pundit and research poll have emphasized the power these young voters have to shape the election, and Harris is clearly listening. This is the second time in the month since Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee that she has embraced a powerful, young and zeitgeist-y singer. It’s naïve to believe that effective use of campaign merch is enough to win Gen-Z voters, long painted as fickle and disillusioned, the first generation of ostensibly liberal-leaning voters that won’t vote blue just for the sake of voting blue. Or that a trendy fashion statement will entice the votes of so-called red state people. But the hats are still selling. And they remain a powerful symbol for the reach and cultural impact of the Harris-Walz campaign in ways we can’t ignore."
Lawyers are rarely kicked off cases.

Now, she’s been disqualified from representing a client in a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems in Washington, D.C., regarding allegedly false statements about the company’s role in that election. The company sued Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne for his baseless claims that Dominion ran the 2020 election, that its technology was developed by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and that it hired a truck to shred 3,000 pounds of ballots. Dominion said those statements were false and not only harmed the company’s reputation and business but also resulted in serious threats to its employees, their families, and election workers. It’s a high bar to disqualify a lawyer from representing a client. But Lambert cleared it for reasons explained by U.S. magistrate judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya. Indeed, the judge’s opinion Tuesday cited “at least five reasons that illustrate why Lambert’s conduct meets the high bar for disqualification”: Upadhyaya noted that Lambert had disclosed confidential Dominion case material in one of her own criminal cases and that she shared documents with a sheriff (who had no role in this litigation) who also publicly spread the information. “This is not a case of an inadvertent breach or good faith disclosure,” the judge wrote, calling it “unfathomable for Lambert to believe she could do whatever she wanted with Dominion’s Litigation Documents.” The judge also said that Byrne himself violated the protective order and that Dominion might seek sanctions against him. But Byrne wasn’t the subject of this opinion. Lambert was, in the latest example of Donald Trump-aligned lawyers facing consequences for going off the rails in the face of Trump’s 2020 election loss — some of whom might not be lawyers anymore when all is said and done.

Rep. Ilhan Omar wins primary race after two 'Squad' members' defeats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 10:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ilhan-omar-primary-minnesota-squad-israel-gaza-rcna166550,"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., handily won her primary race on Tuesday against an opponent, Don Samuels, who was boosted by fundraising from pro-Israel donors. Elected in 2018, Omar is now almost certain to clinch re-election in November to represent Minnesota’s deep-blue 5th District. She defeated Samuels in the 2022 primary. Omar told supporters on Tuesday night that she was ""incredibly honored"" by the results. “I am honored to represent the people who welcomed me and my family as refugees to this incredible state,” she said. The victory by Omar, a leading pro-Palestinian advocate in Congress and a vocal critic of Israel, comes on the heels of primary losses for Reps. Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman, fellow progressive ""Squad"" colleagues who have also condemned Israel's military assault on Gaza. Bush and Bowman were defeated by opponents backed by the pro-Israel group AIPAC. The United Democracy Project, a super PAC affiliated with the group, poured millions of dollars into both races, buying ads attacking the incumbents. Bowman's race was the most expensive House primary in history, and Bush's the second-most expensive. As a candidate, Omar had fewer obvious vulnerabilities than Bush or Bowman. After narrowly winning her primary against Samuels in 2022, she stepped up her outreach to voters and spent more on ads. Another factor in her race was that AIPAC sat it out; in 2022, the United Democracy Project spent $350,000 trying to oust Omar. In AIPAC's absence, wealthy pro-Israel donors stepped in to raise funds for Samuels’ campaign, The Intercept reported this week. Samuels' campaign received a boost in donations after Wesley Bell won his primary against Bush last week, but Omar's financial prowess proved insurmountable."
Judge Merchan rejects Trump’s recusal bid — again — ahead of sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 6:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-merchan-trump-recusal-rejection-rcna166190,"Judge Juan Merchan again declined to recuse himself from Donald Trump’s New York criminal case, rejecting the former president’s third attempt to get rid of the presiding judge in his so-called hush money case. Refusing to step aside in a decision dated Tuesday, Merchan called the GOP presidential nominee's arguments ""nothing more than a repetition of stale and unsubstantiated claims."" The judge noted that he was reiterating, ""for the third time, that which should already be clear - innuendo and mischaracterizations do not a conflict create. Recusal is therefore not necessary, much less required."" Merchan not only rejected the motion, but also called out Trump's counsel in the process. While noting that he welcomed zealous advocacy and creative lawyering, he recalled in his ruling that ""counsel has been warned repeatedly that such advocacy must not come at the expense of professional responsibility in one's role as an officer of the court."" The judge added: ""Counsel has merely repeated arguments that have already been denied by this and higher courts. Defense Counsel's reliance, and apparent citation to his own prior affirmation, rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims, is unavailing."" Trump’s latest recusal attempt, filed by defense lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, cited the fact of Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee as a reason for the judge to step aside because of his daughter’s political campaign-related work. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office called the defense move “a vexatious and frivolous attempt to relitigate an issue that was twice addressed by this Court in orders that the First Department then refused to disturb,” referring to the New York state appeals court. “Defendant identifies no new facts or changes in the law that warrant a different outcome,” the prosecution wrote to Merchan ahead of his ruling, pointing out that Trump’s previous motions already argued that Harris was Trump’s political opponent and that Merchan’s daughter would benefit from rulings in this case. The denial moves Trump one step closer to sentencing. But first, Merchan will need to rule on another Trump motion, to set aside his guilty verdicts in light of the Supreme Court's ruling granting broad presidential immunity. If Merchan also rejects that motion, sentencing would proceed on Sept. 18 on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, an “E” felony (the lowest-level New York state felony) that doesn’t mandate incarceration. Sentencing was supposed to happen in July, but the immunity decision pushed it back, raising the question of whether evidence was improperly introduced at trial that ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s newly concocted presidential immunity rule. Merchan will answer that complex question in the first instance in his ruling due Sept. 16, though the Supreme Court may eventually have the final word in all of Trump’s cases in which he invokes immunity.

Trump campaign downplays travel on Jeffrey Epstein’s old plane,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-campaign-jeffrey-epstein-old-plane-rcna166462,"Former President Donald Trump and his campaign broke one of the most obvious unwritten rules of electioneering: never do anything to remind voters of your previous, yet-to-be-fully-explained relationship with one of the world’s most notorious child molesters. Nonetheless, the Trump campaign says it has a perfectly good reason the candidate recently used a plane previously owned by the late Jeffrey Epstein to get to various campaign stops, as the Miami Herald reported.  According to the report:  The Herald went into a bit more detail later in the report, explaining how Trump’s decals had been placed on Epstein’s old plane so it resembled the one he owns.  Per the Herald: So there you have it, folks. Sure, Trump has flown on Epstein’s private jets plenty of times in the past, for reasons that remain unclear. But this time is different from all those times in that this one might just be coincidental. Glad the Trump camp cleared that up.  Still, I’d argue anything that even potentially reminds voters of Trump’s past experiences partying with Epstein or the fact Trump wished Epstein’s co-conspirator well in his sex trafficking case could be considered an own goal at this point."
Time is money and Joe Biden’s trying to help Americans waste less of both,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-business-policy-election-2024-time-is-money-rcna166397,"The first half of President Joe Biden’s term was focused on doing big things. His initial plans out of the gate, compiled in the “Build Back Better” agenda, were sweeping and transformative. The legislation that was spun out of that package — including the Inflation Reduction Act, the massive infrastructure bill and the CHIPS and Science Act — were major investments in the country’s future. Now though, as we approach the final few months of what will be his single term, Biden is going smaller. At first glance, the “Time Is Money” initiative that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced Monday could be seen as relatively insignificant. But in this case, smaller doesn’t mean less important or impactful. In fact, in setting his White House’s sights on the ways corporations sap Americans’ time and money, Biden is making an argument that there’s plenty the federal government can do to improve the way we live. The new effort from the Biden-Harris administration is focused on “the corporate practice of giving people the run around, wasting their precious time and money,” according to the White House’s fact sheet. In particular, the aim is tackling the seemingly minor inconveniences that add up to major hassle at the expense of consumers: Accordingly, the Biden administration is pulling what levers it can to combat this scourge — or at least getting the ball rolling. Given how long it generally takes for a proposed federal rule to go from concept to policy, many of the changes listed won’t be felt until after the election. By the same token, though, it’s important that the process to get these rules into place begin sooner rather than later. The only finalized policy among those listed as part of the “Time Is Money” initiative is the Transportation Department’s much-lauded (and promoted) rule that requires airlines to provide automatic refunds for canceled flights. Next furthest along are the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed rules that would require that companies make it as easy to cancel a subscription as it is to sign up for one. The FTC is reviewing public comments on that proposed rule. Another proposed rule from the FTC would “stop marketers from using illicit review and endorsement practices such as using fake reviews, suppressing honest negative reviews, and paying for positive reviews,” which would make online shopping much easier after years of decline. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has two rules in the works. One would cut back on the “doom loops” that force callers to listen to long messages before they reach an actual human being. The other would limit how banks and other corporations use chatbots and artificial intelligence voice recordings to give users the runaround. The remaining policies listed are more requests than rules, including a call from the Department of Health and Human Services to have health insurance providers make the process to submit claims far less cumbersome. This is exactly the kind of executive action that you’d expect from a president looking to get things done while Congress is deep in campaign season. Without the ability to pass major new legislation, the executive branch must get creative with its powers to get anything new done. These time-wasters are also a (literally) rich target for Biden politically, as you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t had gripes about them. It also brings to mind Biden’s calling out companies for “shrinkflation” and the perennial call for the government to tackle the out-of-control number of spam calls reaching our phones. Beyond the consumer protection side of things, I’d argue there’s a worker protection component to these policies, as well. All too often it’s the customer service worker following company policy who bears the brunt of consumer ire. In leveraging the government’s weight against these businesses, Biden is both providing a more equal playing field for purchasers and acting as a relief valve for those workers. The one concern I have is that congressional Republicans could raise a fuss if they wanted to push back on any of these rules. The deadline has passed to lock in new federal rules that will be safe from a possible GOP trifecta’s having the ability to quickly overturn them next year. But it’s wild to imagine Republicans explicitly campaigning in favor of businesses’ having a right to make Americans’ lives harder and more annoying. Conversely, these are policies that Harris will absolutely want to highlight as she barrels toward Election Day. Reuters reported Tuesday that she’ll deliver a policy-centered speech this week focused on plans “to lower costs for middle-class families and take on corporate price-gouging.” In doing so, Harris will be able to provide a sharp contrast between the GOP ticket’s dark plans for America and a brighter future — one in which canceling your gym membership no longer feels as taxing as a workout."

"I don’t live in Minnesota. But thanks to Tim Walz, my life-saving OB-GYN does.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 3:07 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 13, 2024, 3:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-minnesota-abortion-south-dakota-doctor-rcna166308,"Life is about choices.  Shortly after my beloved grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it was clear that I had a choice: I could remain thousands of miles away, in Brooklyn, New York, where I have happily lived for eight years, or I could pack up my family of four and move to rural South Dakota to be closer to my extended family.  My husband and I decided to move. But on the day before we started looking for houses, I found out I was pregnant.  Suddenly, I wasn’t just choosing to move to a new state. I was choosing to move to a new state with a near-total abortion ban while carrying a high-risk “geriatric” pregnancy and a history of pregnancy-related complications.  Around the same time, the country was presented with its own surprise choice. After President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris dramatically changed the course of the upcoming election. The Democratic nominee for president injected hope and joy into an election cycle previously dominated by fear and despair. Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate pushed progressive optimism into overdrive.  Walz has defied the stereotypical caricatures of white, straight, male Midwestern politicians. From fighting to end period poverty in schools, to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights and providing free breakfast and lunch for all Minnesota students, Walz is a living reminder that the middle half of this country is not uniformly conservative or inherently regressive.  In 2023, in response to the Supreme Court defying decades of legal precedent and overturning Roe v. Wade, Walz signed a law enshrining abortion access into Minnesota statutes, ensuring that the state will continue to offer abortion care regardless of the courts system.  Now, at 22 weeks pregnant, it’s a law I am directly benefiting from.  Living just 30-ish minutes from the state’s border, I drive 45 minutes into Minnesota to receive my prenatal care at Pipestone County Medical Center. It was not easy to set up care in a neighboring state; I had to guarantee that my insurance would cover out-of-state costs, that my provider in New York state could send over medical records, and that the team in Pipestone, Minnesota, could take on another (out-of-state) patient.  After two weeks of calls, emails and yes, even faxes, appointments were made and I was assured by a nurse that I was in good hands, that I would be cared for, that if the worst-case scenario occurred my Minnesota team would be legally able to help.  In South Dakota, abortions are banned with very limited exceptions and providing an illegal abortion is a felony. While physicians are permitted to administer abortion care if the life of the pregnant person is in danger, like all abortion exceptions the language is vague and has left doctors, nurses and health care providers to navigate a treacherous gray area. I’m all too aware of the risks. Studies have shown and countless stories have highlighted a horrifying post-Roe reality: pregnant people in need of lifesaving abortion or miscarriage care have been turned away, or have been forced to endure invasive, unnecessary C-sections in order to spare attending doctors the possibility of hefty fines and possible jail time.  One recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics found that Texas’ abortion ban is responsible for an increase in the state’s infant mortality rate. At 37 years old, my pregnancy is automatically considered more dangerous. I also have experienced multiple miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and the loss of a twin at nearly 20 weeks gestation that forced me to give birth to one baby who was alive alongside the remains of a fetus. Given this history, I did not want to even chance the possibility of becoming another statistic in yet another study that highlights the devastating impact of abortion bans.  So I will make the choice, over and over again during my pregnancy, to cross state lines and ensure comprehensive prenatal care that, if necessary, could legally include an abortion. I will choose to give birth in a state I do not call home, just in case I experience a labor complication that South Dakota state physicians might be too scared to help me survive.  But this choice is not offered to countless pregnant people in South Dakota, or in the 21 other states that ban or severely restrict a common medical procedure that an estimated 1 out of every 4 women (as well as trans and nonbinary people) undergo in their lifetime.  An estimated 25 million women live in a state that bans or severely restricts abortion care. One recent Associated Press analysis found that more than 100 pregnant people have been either turned away from or negligently treated at emergency rooms since 2022. An estimated 1 in 5 women are traveling an average of 86 miles to receive the abortion care they want and need. Recently, two women living in Texas have filed federal complaints after they were denied abortion care to treat life-ending ectopic pregnancies and, as a result, nearly died. Fellow Texan Ryan Hamilton wrote down, in excruciating detail, the sequence of events after complications from an incomplete miscarriage — and medical staff reluctant to intervene — that nearly led to his wife's death. Walz’s so-called “abortion sanctuary state” gave me that choice, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing my physicians will never face federal prosecution for providing me with the care I may need.  Now, the nation has a similar choice. As Republicans continue to attack abortion rights and champion a nationwide abortion ban, Harris and her running mate are providing the country with an alternative — one that trusts pregnant people to make their own decisions about their bodies, pregnancies and families; that empowers physicians to do their jobs and adhere to their Hippocratic oaths; that continues to ensure parenthood is not a punishment for having sex but one of life’s overwhelming, joyful, scary, wonderful decisions. Life is about choices. I hope, come November, this country makes the right one. "
Judge Reed O'Connor recuses himself from Elon Musk's advertiser lawsuit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 1:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/elon-musk-reed-oconnor-recusal-advertiser-lawsuit-rcna166437,"When lawyers for Elon Musk’s “X Corp.” filed an antitrust lawsuit against advertisers in the Wichita Falls division of the Northern District of Texas, the case was destined for U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, who has several right-wing rulings to his resume. But the apparent judge-shopping was foiled Tuesday when O’Connor recused himself from the case. Why did he do so? His brief filing didn’t say.  The recusal comes after NPR reporting on the judge’s investment in Tesla stock, which NPR noted “has fueled questions over O’Connor’s fairness as a judge, since the outcome of the suits filed by [Tesla CEO] Musk’s X could impact his business empire.” However, in the other suit to which NPR referred — against watchdog Media Matters — O’Connor has not recused. It would’ve been helpful if the judge had explained the reasoning for his recusal. Whatever the judge’s rationale or what comes of either suit (though Musk’s chances in one may now be dimmer without O’Connor), the episode highlights the absurdity of apparent judge shopping: As NPR pointed out, none of the parties in either case is based in Texas. The advertiser case was reassigned to another judge in the Northern District, Ed Kinkeade. The recusal occurred alongside another, unrelated legal development for Musk. The UAW said on Tuesday that it has filed federal labor charges against him and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, stemming from comments they made during a conversation on X on Monday night. The UAW characterized the rhetoric as “illegal attempts to threaten and intimidate workers who stand up for themselves by engaging in protected concerted activity, such as strikes.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

North Carolina Republican candidates are breaking the 'crazy meter',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 1:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/north-carolina-republicans-candidates-robinson-morrow-rcna166440,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 12 episode of ""The Rachel Maddow Show."" The last time a Democratic presidential candidate won North Carolina was Barack Obama in 2008. But since Vice President Kamala Harris moved to the top of the Democratic ticket three weeks ago, Democrats are feeling like North Carolina may be in reach for them again. A new poll released by YouGov on Sunday shows Donald Trump and Harris currently tied in North Carolina at 46% each. Some of that is absolutely the relative appeal of the two candidates and their campaigns, but part of what may be lifting Democrats in North Carolina is that the Republican candidate for governor there is — and I believe this is the technical term — cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.Republican Mark Robinson calls gay people “filth.” He says schoolteachers are “wicked people.” He has mocked and attacked school shooting survivors. He has warned ominously that the music industry is run by the Illuminati. He said the film “Black Panther” was created by Jews and “satanic Marxists.” And he has — perhaps you won’t find this surprising — engaged in Holocaust denial. This man is the Republican nominee for governor in a totally normal state, a real place called North Carolina. That same YouGov poll that found Trump and Harris tied in the presidential race in North Carolina found Robinson losing the governor’s race to Democrat Josh Stein by a whopping 10 points. Now there’s new reporting highlighting another statewide Republican candidate in North Carolina who is right up there with Robinson on the crazy meter. In a since-deleted Facebook livestream unearthed by CNN, Michele Morrow, the Republican nominee to run North Carolina public schools, can reportedly be seen in a Washington, D.C.-area hotel the night of Jan. 6, 2021, advocating for a military coup to keep Trump in power. Previously Morrow called for the killing of Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats, including the public execution of former President Barack Obama.Again, this is now the Republican nominee for superintendent of all public K-12 education in North Carolina. Notably, Morrow calls public schools “socialism centers” and “indoctrination centers.” She is endorsed by Robinson, who said at a recent event with her, “We’re gonna make sure we do everything to get you in office.” With folks like that leading the statewide Republican ticket in North Carolina, Democrats think their presidential ticket has a real shot.

Kamala Harris' new ad is a pitch-perfect response to Donald Trump's attacks,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 1:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-immigration-record-donald-trump-rcna166421,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Vice President Kamala Harris is going on the offense, and touting what she sees as her tough immigration record in a new campaign ad. Since she entered the race, Republicans have attacked Harris over the issue, falsely labeling her as the administration’s “border czar.” This ad is exactly what the vice president should be doing: You go in on the issue that your opponent thinks is your weakness and make it your strength. It’s something Harris has done effectively on the campaign trail already. And it’s something that I suspect she’ll do effectively at the debate next month.  It’s very simple and the facts speak for themselves here. In July, border crossings were lower than during Donald Trump’s last month in the White House. There’s also the border bill backed by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma — the most conservative immigration bill in decades. While Harris supported that deal, Trump stopped it — ordering House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson to kill the bill.  He did so because the bill would not only be good for those on the border who are concerned about illegal immigration, but also because it would be good news politically for President Joe Biden. The ad was an effective way for Harris’ campaign to hit back against Trump and Republicans’ misinformation on her immigration record. We’ll see how it plays with voters in the coming weeks."
JD Vance uses his wife to whitewash Trump’s white supremacist problem,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 12:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-usha-trump-white-supremacist-nick-fuentes-rcna166282,"Sen. JD Vance tried to paper over former President Donald Trump’s connection with white nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes during an interview over the weekend.  Speaking with ABC News’ Jon Karl, Vance was asked about Trump’s widely criticized dinner with Fuentes and the Hitler-loving rapper, Ye in 2022, as well as Fuentes’ recent comments that Trump shouldn't have picked Vance as a running mate in part because Vance’s wife, Usha, is Indian American. Trump’s VP pick agreed with Karl’s summation of Fuentes’ attacks on his wife as “racist garbage.”  But after Karl noted “this is also a guy that dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago during this campaign,” Vance chimed in with some spin.  He said: After Vance falsely claimed Trump condemned his own dinner with Fuentes amid the backlash, Karl corrected him and noted that Trump has never condemned Fuentes or his views.  And that’s when Vance claimed his wife’s personal interactions with Trump assured him.  He said:  Evidently, Vance wants us to believe Trump’s willingness to dine with an avowed white supremacist and a Nazi-loving rapper is merely a sign of his welcoming nature. And Vance doesn't appear to have any qualms about using his Indian American wife, or her purportedly amiable interactions with Trump, to downplay the questions about the candidate’s ties to white supremacy and antisemitic hate. Usha Vance previously sat for an interview and attempted to downplay her husband’s misogynistic ""childless cat ladies"" comment. Now, her husband is using her ethnicity and gender to downplay Trump’s deference to bigots. Republicans have spent the better part of the past two weeks ridiculously accusing Democrats of antisemitism after Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.  Meanwhile, Trump and the GOP’s open association with antisemitic figures, including Fuentes and Ye, go unmentioned. Republicans haven’t devised a cogent explanation for this hypocrisy. And if Vance’s remarks are any sign, they won’t anytime soon. "
Roger Stone says his email accounts were how the hackers got into the Trump campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 12:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/roger-stone-email-hack-trump-campaign-rcna166422,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Donald Trump who helped to push the fake electors scheme, told the Washington Post that one of his email accounts was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack that was targeting the Trump campaign. The news surrounding this hack has been moving quickly, so let's review the sequence of events so far.  The juicy story here is that one of the most mischievous and aggressively outspoken figures in Trump’s orbit was the one whose private communications appears to have compromised — and possibly compromised others in the Trump campaign, as well. But a notable subplot is the media’s markedly different response to hacked campaign documents when they come into their hands directly, as compared to the 2016 feeding frenzy over private communications stolen from the Clinton campaign and made public by Wikileaks. The Associated Press is out with a story on the media outlets that have thus far chosen not to publish documents they've received as a result of the hack.  Remember when Trump literally called on Russia to ""find"" missing Clinton emails and declared his love for WikiLeaks?  Now Trump is benefitting from a restraint that neither he nor the media have afforded other politicians in a similar situation.

5th Circuit says 'geofence' warrants violate the Fourth Amendment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 10:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/geofence-warrant-fourth-amendment-fifth-circuit-rcna166370,"The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has broken new ground again — but perhaps not in the way you might think. While that court has issued extreme rulings aligned with Republican Party preferences that have gone too far even for the Supreme Court, this latest decision deals with the Fourth Amendment, an area of the law where opinions can cut across party lines. And now this issue could be headed for the justices, too. This time, a 5th Circuit panel held that so-called geofence warrants are unconstitutional. Such warrants seek location information within a certain area and time frame as a means to identify suspects; in the case of United States v. Smith, it was used to find robbers. In reaching its conclusion, the appeals court has split with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said recently in United States v. Chatrie that it didn’t count as a Fourth Amendment “search” when the government got two hours’ worth of location information from Google that had been voluntarily exposed by the defendant. Such “circuit splits,” as they’re called, generally increase the chances of Supreme Court review, because the justices can resolve them to ensure uniformity across the country. But this issue might not be settled by the high court soon, for a couple of reasons. First, the rulings aren’t necessarily the last word within the circuits, because both cases were three-judge panel decisions, and the full appeals courts in both circuits could weigh in and reach different conclusions. If that happens, then the decisions of those full courts could determine the next moves. The 5th Circuit covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, while the 4th Circuit covers Maryland, the Virginias and the Carolinas. Moreover, the Supreme Court hasn’t been eager to take Fourth Amendment cases lately. Its biggest such case in recent years was Carpenter v. United States, decided in 2018. But both of these geofence warrant rulings cite Carpenter to reach different conclusions, showing that the justices have open questions to settle in this area of the law.

Why Elon Musk’s hugely hyped X talk with Trump was so disappointing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 7:25 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-elon-musk-x-interview-zero-surprises-zero-appeal-rcna166309,"X owner Elon Musk hosted former President Donald Trump for a much-anticipated conversation on Spaces on Monday night. Musk — who has endorsed Trump and is actively using his wealth and influence to get him elected again — stressed at the outset that this would be a “non-adversarial” conversation aimed at “open-minded, independent voters who might be trying to make up their mind.” But before that performatively centrist intro, the event started much like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ glitch-plagued, campaign-imploding Twitter Spaces interview with Musk in May 2023 — disastrously. People looking to tune into the Musk-Trump conversation were mostly met with a blank purple square for more than 40 minutes.  Musk blamed the technical failure on a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. But as The Verge quickly reported, the rest of the site was operating just fine, indicating such an attack was highly unlikely.  As the delay dragged on, the billionaire Mark Pincus, another self-avowed Democrat for Trump,  tweeted in response to Musk's attack claim, “Its Dems fighting to ‘save’ Democracy from two massive disrupters!” [sic] Musk, ever the seeker of truth,  replied: “Yeah.” And that’s how Musk handled most of the conversation. He’d tee up Trump not with questions, but with semi-coherent pronouncements about illegal immigration or urban crime or how climate change is no big deal and we shouldn’t “demonize” oil and gas industry executives who are literally “saving civilization” as we speak. (Musk, during the conversation, described his own position on the topic as “pretty moderate.”) Trump would then reply in the same manner as his broadly panned RNC acceptance speech — interminably parroting random pieces of MAGA bromides. Musk would chirp into these soliloquies with an occasional “Yeah.”  Sometimes he’d sprinkle in an “I agree with you” or a “You make an interesting point.” But the alphaest of alpha male civilization-saving tech bros reduced himself to an unctuous hype man for an ever-more inarticulate Trump.  During the interview, Musk repeatedly said he’s been mostly apolitical throughout his life but also, confusingly, that he’s been a left-leaning Democrat his whole life.  And Musk wasn’t hiding the ball. He was quite clear on the point of this conversation — to convince persuadable voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is a Marxist, Israel-hating, open borders-advocating, cop-criminalizing supervillain. Moments later, they’d paint her as a cowardly, unaccomplished idiot not even smart enough to handle a conversation like the one they were having.  Musk and Trump both present as very needy men, perpetually thirsty for praise. So I’ll give them something: It is a remarkable achievement for two of the most powerful and influential right-wing political figures of our time to say essentially nothing of substance for over two hours and five minutes. Don, Elon — I’m impressed. To comprehensively fact-check this wet sandbox of rhetoric-heavy, meme-level political discourse is probably not worth the effort.  Suffice to say, Trump’s claims that the Democratic Republic of Congo is emptying its prisons to send them to the U.S. as migrants are not true. Nor is it true, as Trump insisted, that Harris is more left-wing than democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. It is also plainly untrue that Trump is a champion of free speech, as Musk declared.  As is Musk’s insistence that inflation — a global issue exacerbated by the pandemic — can be curbed simply by empowering something he called a “government efficiency commission” and deregulating all major industries (like the ones in which he owns companies). Whichever political direction one leans, economics are a little more complicated than that. But top men such as Musk and Trump are rarely told by their friends/employees that they’re not making any sense and that they should probably read up on the subject before pontificating in front of a million X Spaces listeners.  There were two moments where the conversation had a chance of becoming mildly interesting.  One was when Trump complained that artificial intelligence uses a lot of electricity. If Musk were as brave and inquisitive as his devotees claim, this would have been a great opportunity to show it. But the crypto-enthusiast Musk, rather than defend his preferred technologies’ outrageous use of energy, simply changed the subject back to his prospective “government efficiency commission.”  The other almost-interesting moment was when Trump rambled about certain places he says were made uninhabitable for thousands of years after nuclear plant accidents. Musk — for the first and only time in the conversation — pushed back on Trump, saying he’d been to Fukushima (the site of the nuclear plant disaster in 2011) and eaten locally grown vegetables.  Trump, in a role reversal, replied, “Yeah, yeah.” The pretense that people like Musk are courageous for hosting “civil” conversations like this remains ridiculous, but it’s a well-worn cliche at this point, the opposite of shocking.   And maybe I’m jaded by the lowering of standards that came with the rise of Trump, but there was nothing exceptional about this event. It was dull, uninformative and relentlessly repetitive. Both Musk and Trump have followers who would walk into the sea on their commands, but sitting through this entire thing takes a certain dedication. If you’re looking for two hours of overcompensating attempts at hypermasculinity, basic GOP fearmongering talking points about crime and immigration, and a touch of slobbering back-patting about free speech and civility — the Musk/Trump show is your ticket.

Republicans go to Supreme Court in bid to enforce Arizona voting law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 6:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/republicans-supreme-court-arizona-voter-registration-law-rcna166267,"As November’s presidential election nears, one legal question that arises is how involved the Supreme Court will get. The impending resolution of an emergency bid from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans in a battleground state dispute could give us a sense this month of how the high court will handle requests to intervene this election season. Republicans want the court to permit Arizona to enforce a state law that requires documentary proof of citizenship in order to vote. They’re challenging a federal appeals court panel’s approval of a district court injunction against the law. The GOP told the justices that the injunction “is an unprecedented abrogation of the Arizona Legislature’s sovereign authority to determine the qualifications of voters and structure participation in its elections.” Republicans are seeking an immediate pause of the injunction to the extent that it requires the state to (1) accept voter registration applications without documentary proof of citizenship and (2) allow voters who have not provided documentary proof of citizenship to cast ballots for president or vote by mail. Notably, the three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel approved the injunction over dissent from a Trump appointee, which could get at least some of the justices’ attention. Indeed, the application cites the dissent from Judge Patrick Bumatay, echoing what he deemed the unusual procedural history of the case, in which his appellate panel ruled differently than an earlier circuit panel. Bumatay wrote: “All the public can take away from this episode is that four judges of the Ninth Circuit have voted to partially stay the injunction here, while two other judges voted against it. The two judges prevail — not because of any special insight, but because of the luck of an internal Ninth Circuit draw.” The more recent panel majority said that the earlier panel “overlooked ‘considerations specific to election cases’ and misunderstood the extent of confusion and chaos that would be engendered by a late-stage alteration to the status quo of Arizona’s election rules in apparent disregard of the Supreme Court’s admonitions in Purcell v. Gonzalez.” But in their application to the justices, Republicans said it’s the more recent appeals court that used the Purcell case incorrectly, arguing that the Supreme Court “has repeatedly instructed that the Purcell principle bars federal courts from enjoining the enforcement of state election laws with an election impending.” So the outcome could hinge on which side the high court thinks has the better reading of this principle, an important one for election cases. A written response to the application from voting rights groups is due Friday. The application cited an Aug. 22 deadline, so we may learn by then how the justices will settle this challenge — and perhaps get a hint of what’s to come as we head toward November.

RFK Jr.'s campaign is in decline. It could still be decisive on Election Day.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-jr-trump-harris-third-party-election-rogan-rcna166263,"Robert Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign is in decline. But his presence in the election remains significant, and it looks like he could be a major thorn in former President Donald Trump’s side should he stay in the race through Election Day. For many months Kennedy was averaging around 10% in national presidential polls that matched him up against Trump and President Joe Biden. After Biden dropped out and Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as his replacement, Kennedy’s support swiftly halved, and he’s averaging around 5% in the polls now. Kennedy has been participating in conferences and events, but he has otherwise vanished from the campaign trail for over a month, NBC News reports. And Nicole Shanahan, his running mate, campaign funder and valiant warrior against demonic control of the federal government, has been missing from the campaign stump for even longer. A good chunk of Kennedy’s decline can be explained by Harris’ rise. One of the key dynamics of the Biden-Trump 2024 match-up was the significant contingent of so-called double haters, voters who hold unfavorable views of Biden and Trump. While Harris is also underwater when it comes to favorability ratings, she’s still significantly more popular than Biden. She’s younger and more energetic than him, she seems less encumbered by some voters’ anxieties about the Biden administration’s economic record, and she has completely transformed the party’s 2024 messaging, giving voters something fresh and new to grapple with. “There’s no doubt that Kamala Harris has picked up some undecided and third-party support since she’s become the nominee,” David Wasserman, a senior editor and an elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, recently told The Atlantic. While Democrats have targeted Trump world with the insult “weird,” Kennedy has emerged as the person in the race who is most deserving of that label. In May, news emerged that Kennedy said in a 2012 deposition that a worm ate part of his brain. More recently, Kennedy released an utterly bizarre video in which he tells antisemitic conspiracy theorist Roseanne Barr that he left a dead bear cub in Central Park and staged it so it would look like it was killed in a collision with a bicycle. In an attempt to share more about his personal life, he told The New York Times that he once lived with an emu that used to attack his wife. While it’s unclear if this kind of news hurt his standing with his supporters, it certainly could not have helped him grow his base of support as an exciting new candidate emerged for the Democratic Party. But Kennedy’s numbers are still significant enough to play a potentially decisive role on Election Day, and recent polls show that in polls with three-way match-ups he is consistently hurting Trump more than he’s hurting Harris. That makes sense, considering that Kennedy’s campaign has focused most aggressively on a libertarian attitude toward public health and conspiracy theories about race, vaccines and satanic cabals — the kinds of ideas that appeal to many in the MAGA camp. Last week, Joe Rogan, the world’s most popular podcaster and a thought leader for millions of American men, praised Kennedy as “the only one that makes sense to me.” (Rogan later clarified that his comment was not meant as an endorsement.) But Rogan’s comments were enough to enrage Trump and his allies, who are already on the defensive after Harris’ rise and aware that the fundamental energy of the race has slipped out of their control, at least for now. The Democratic Party has figured out a path to mitigate its double haters problem and most likely increased its vote share because of it. But Republicans do not appear to have a plan. They’re banking on a man who has repeated the same white nationalist and authoritarian rants ad nauseam for close to a decade — and only seems increasingly discursive and incoherent while he does it. Unless Kennedy drops out (and possibly endorses Trump, as Trump has reportedly showed interest in), Trump is likely to face some vexing competition from the other crank in the race."
Trump is letting Vance do the heavy lifting. That could backfire.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-campaign-events-rcna166236,"I’ll give him this: Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has been hustling. The GOP’s vice presidential candidate spent the last week doing some heavy campaigning around the country before appearing on three Sunday shows. But it stands in stark contrast to how low-energy the guy at the top of the ticket, former President Donald Trump, has been since accepting the Republican nomination last month. If you were to ask Vance, it’s all part of the plan. The running mate is traditionally an attack dog for the nominee, a role that he has seemed eager to play in targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. But Trump’s slow pace is odd, even when you consider that August is traditionally a slow month in the presidential campaign season. At some point, if Vance is perceived as doing most of the heavy lifting for the campaign, that could become a major hindrance to Trump’s chances this fall. I’m not bringing up Trump’s sparse schedule to claim that the number of rallies a candidate holds is determinative of who wins an election. Nor am I saying anything similar about crowd sizes, no matter how much it irks him that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have been drawing huge audiences. It does, however, speak to electoral strategy and the lack of any sort of shift from Trump’s camp even as the race has fundamentally changed. When President Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Trump directed the Republican National Committee to divert funds from field operations and get-out-the-vote programs to focus on “election integrity.” His argument at the time was built on the belief that that’s still the greatest motivator to get his supporters out to the polls. But he hasn’t been putting himself out there nearly as much as that bravado would suggest. In fact, he held only a handful of events last week, not counting his hastily called fact-free press conference to try to draw the spotlight back to himself. This sluggishness wasn’t always the case with Trump. During his last two campaigns, he was a very different creature on the stump, sometimes holding multiple rallies in a single day, according to an analysis from The Washington Post’s Philip Bump. In contrast, the newly minted Democratic duo hit up seven stops over the course of five days, absolutely smoking Trump’s lethargic pace. And while it makes sense that the Harris-Walz ticket is in a hurry to introduce itself to voters with just under three months until Election Day, you’d think the Trump campaign would stress a similar urgency on its boss. Instead, it was left up to Vance to tail Harris and Walz around the swing states. The plan was to hit at Harris on issues on which the GOP feels she’s weak: immigration, crime and the economy. But as my colleague Jim Downie explained on Monday, those are all areas where things are improving as we get closer to Election Day, potentially blunting the Republican message against Democrats across the board. Vance’s appearances were also much more sparsely attended than the Harris-Walz events, setting up an unflattering contrast that couldn’t have made Trump happy. Even his attempts to directly confront Harris fell flat. Vance’s decision to literally do a press stop next to Air Force Two in Wisconsin didn’t produce much more than one of the most cringeworthy photo shoots of the election season. It doesn’t help that Vance isn’t exactly Mr. Popular these days. The messaging from Democrats since he was named Trump’s running mate appears to be sticking, according to recent polling. Since the GOP convention, Vance has “become more and more identified with his particular brand of conservatism and less with his famed biography as an author, veteran, and politician,” according to Semafor’s Kadia Goba. Tellingly, when you look at FiveThirtyEight’s polling aggregate, Vance’s unfavorable ratings are higher than Trump’s, which is really saying something. Vance is calling his stalking tour a win so far though, bragging about his Sunday show appearances on X while criticizing Harris’ lack of tough interviews since she became the presumptive nominee. As talking points go, focusing on whether Harris has done as many press appearances as he has doesn’t seem like a strong one. It honestly feels like a remnant of the race against Biden, when the main message was that Biden is too old to properly campaign. This all matters because beyond the energy and enthusiasm that have suffused throughout the Democratic base, the Harris campaign is using its events to sign up volunteers and do other ground-level work necessary to win in November. If Trump is still set to be the main GOTV force, he’s going to have to start pulling his weight rather than letting Vance be the voice of the ticket. And yet, it’s ironically Trump’s inability to stick to a message against Harris in his public appearances that has the potential to make Vance into the more reliable — if underwhelming — campaigner. There is still time for things to shift and Trump to pick up the pace again. Both he and Vance are going to be on the trail this week, including on Wednesday, when they’ll split North Carolina and Michigan between them. Vance will have the earlier appearance, but it’ll be worth seeing just how much more of a crowd Trump draws to his event. All told, the signs point to Vance’s anointment as the future of the MAGA movement as a bit premature — it turns out there’s still nobody quite like Donald Trump."
How Project 2025 plans to reshape the American family,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 3:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-reshape-family-christian-nationalism-trump-rcna166276,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 11 episode of “Velshi.” Project 2025, the authoritarian blueprint for dismantling federal agencies in the next Republican presidency, has a lot of thoughts on what your private relationships should look like and whom you should marry.  In fact, a Christian nationalist vision of the family is a key centerpiece of the 922-page manual. It describes proposals for the American family as “central to the next conservative President’s agenda:"" According to Project 2025, not all families are created equal. On page 451, it defines the “right” kind of family as “a married mother, father, and their children.” It claims this is the “foundation of a well-ordered nation and a healthy society.” Promoting this biblical concept of family is cited as a top-five goal for a revamped Department of Health and Human Services, which it criticizes for “having lost its way” by “promoting equity in everything we do.” The document says efforts at promoting diversity should be repealed and replaced with policies that support what it calls the formation of “stable, married, nuclear families.” In other words, the authors of Project 2025 believe they have the right to dictate what your family should look like, extending the arm of government into your home — and into your bedroom — to enforce a Christian nationalist worldview. They consider this not just a policy preference, but a core function of governance itself. So much for limited government. It should be noted that traditional families — people who are married with children — no longer make up the majority of family compositions in the U.S., according to recent polling by the Pew Research Center. This shift in family structures is due in part to more same-sex couples adopting children or starting their own families, reflecting the diverse and evolving landscape of today’s American society. That diversity, according to the authors of Project 2025, poses a danger to “the very moral foundations of our society.”  The document lays out several proposals for undermining the rights of those who don’t fit the biblical definition of a family. For instance, it wants the government to protect the right of businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples and says that federal grants should be made available to faith-based groups that refuse to recognize same-sex marriage, specifically, groups that, “affirm that marriage is between not just any two adults, but one man and one unrelated woman.” While acknowledging that this would violate the Respect for Marriage Act, which bans discrimination against same-sex couples, the document nonetheless calls for the government to “protect faith-based grant recipients that maintain a biblically based, social science–reinforced definition of marriage and family.” Its policy proposals also demonize children raised in nontraditional households, stating, “Social science reports that assess the outcomes for children raised in homes aside from a heterosexual, intact marriage are clear: All other family forms involve higher levels of instability; financial stress or poverty; or poorer behavioral, psychological, or educational outcomes.” Federally funded family planning clinics would be required to actively promote “the importance of marriage” which describes homes without a husband as “among the most dangerous places for a child to be.” Offensive and bigoted terminology is casually passed off throughout its pages, including urging the next DHS secretary to put an end to “woke transgender activism.” One especially alarming proposal is to criminalize transgender identity as pornography. This proposal likely takes its cue from Russia’s so-called gay propaganda bill passed in 2022, which bans all forms of what it refers to as LGBTQ “propaganda” and prohibits Russians from promoting same-sex relationships. Similarly, Project 2025 considers the “propagation of transgender ideology” to be pornography. The document also mirrors similar rhetoric used by extremist groups such as Moms for Liberty to oppose drag queen reading hours and to keep LGBTQ+ books out of libraries. Just five pages into the foreword, the document states, “The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.” It also classifies gender reassignment surgery as a form of child abuse. To confront these “threats” to straight heterosexual couples, Project 2025 proposes economic incentives for traditional nuclear families, advocating for policymakers to “use government power, including through the tax code, to restore the American family.” By redirecting federal funding to support its biblical view of family, same-sex couples or other family structures would be denied equal benefits given to straight, heterosexual couples. And the timeline for implementing all this? As soon as Donald Trump takes office, which the document assumes is a given.  “Conservatives have just two years and one shot to get this right. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.  The next conservative President will enter office on January 20, 2025, with a simple choice: greatness or failure.” This “very idea of America” seems to exclude the vast majority of American families today, most of whom don’t fit the Christian nationalist mold.

Republican candidate in North Carolina called for a Trump coup on Jan. 6,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/north-carolina-republican-trump-coup-michele-morrow-rcna166281,"This week brought yet another example of how Republican extremism may cost the party in a key state in November. A couple of months back, I wrote about the North Carolina GOP’s placing all of its bets on extreme candidates for statewide office, potentially creating an opening for moderate Democrats. At the time, I focused on attorney general candidate Dan Bishop, who compared Donald Trump’s treatment in his criminal court cases to being a Black Southerner in the Jim Crow era. But there’s also unabashedly bigoted gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson and Chad Brown, a lesser-known secretary of state candidate who has pushed the GOP’s bogus “election integrity” rhetoric and previously touted an endorsement from hate-mongering baseball legend Curt Schilling.  Another person on my list was Michele Morrow, the far-right superintendent candidate who has recorded herself complaining about people speaking foreign languages in public and, according to CNN, previously called for the execution of Democrats like President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.  Last week, CNN reported more disturbing details about Morrow’s past behavior.  According to CNN: CNN linked to public videos of Morrow at the Capitol during the deadly Jan. 6 riot, but it said it has no proof she entered the building or committed violence herself. Still, the video evidence — shared by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski — of Morrow effectively calling for a pro-Trump military coup after the riot failed is unsettling, given things we already know about her. In a few short months, Morrow could win control over North Carolina’s public school system. It’s a frightening prospect and one Democrats would be smart to highlight as they lay out the stakes of this race — along with others featuring GOP extremists in North Carolina — this November."
Olympians giving their all for the U.S. should get more in return,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 2:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/paris-olympics-healthcare-tiktok-ariana-ramsey-rcna166059,"The Olympics have come to an end after what feels like an exceptionally triumphant two weeks. Paris 2024 is being hailed by some as the best Olympics we’ve ever seen, in terms of production, ratings and the overall quality of competition. It was certainly triumphant for the United States, which finishes the Games atop the leaderboard in overall medals and tied with China for first in golds. Between Team USA basketball, the USWNT, Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, track and field — these Olympics were a showcase of excellence and at times redemption for the Americans. At a time of great division, for two weeks at least, we were all patriots. But the Olympics have always presented a profound dilemma to me, as someone who has covered sport through a critical lens for more than a decade. (Shameless plug: There’s an entire chapter in my book about this very dilemma.) I absolutely adore the Olympics — the joy, the spectacle, and most of all, the all-too-rare showcasing of women’s sports. But historically, they’ve been a hotbed for corruption and bribery, cost overruns, doping scandals, environmental havoc, militarized policing, population displacement and sportswashing — when major sporting events serve to distract from a country’s very real problems, whether it’s political turmoil, human rights abuses or the struggles of everyday people to pay for housing or health care. It’s that last part I find myself thinking about now that the Games are over, as we all return to the reality of the challenges we face at home. The Olympics highlighted many issues we can’t just ignore through gold-colored glasses. The USA Water Polo team was among the feel-good stories of the competition, with Flavor Flav becoming its No. 1 hype man, lending his star power and his dollars to the women’s team in particular. But let’s not lose sight of why he felt he had to get involved in the first place: It was in response to Maggie Steffen’s Instagram post calling for increased financial support. Steffens noted that most athletes work second and third jobs to fund their journeys to the Olympic stage.  For two weeks every four years, we exalt these athletes as the best examples of American excellence; we proudly uphold them as star-spangled avatars for all of us; we point to every medal as evidence that we are indeed the greatest country in the world. But once the Olympics are over, we largely leave these athletes to fend for themselves, implying that the glory and privilege of representing our nation should be enough. That dynamic was especially stark in the case of discus thrower Veronica Fraley, who posted on social media that she was struggling to pay her rent the day before she was set to compete. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian saw the post and sent her money, and her GoFundMe page has raised more than her $20,000 goal since the story went viral. It was a lovely gesture. But athletes shouldn’t have to rely on the benevolence of wealthy, celebrity fans or crowdsourcing just to make ends meet, especially not when the institutions they play for are benefiting so much from their achievements.  It’s indicative of a broader trend we’re seeing with everyday Americans. Stories abound detailing people with catastrophic medical conditions in dire financial straits who were only able to survive due to the kindness of strangers. Some medical professionals actively recommend crowdsourcing as a way to pay for medical bills, to the point where The Atlantic declared GoFundMe “a health care utility.” The heartwarming headlines from the Olympics and the generosity of people like Flavor Flav, Ohanian and smaller GoFundMe donors are billed as feel-good stories, but they also serve to placate us into accepting the current state of things. But if anything, these Olympics demonstrated firsthand that it doesn’t have to be this way. USA Rugby player Ariana Ramsey went viral for using her time in Paris to take advantage of the free health care provided in the Olympic Village. Ramsey was astounded to walk into the clinic and receive basic preventative care like pap smears and teeth cleaning at no cost. “I haven’t had an eye exam in a really long time,” Ramsey told The Washington Post. “So, I was like: Why not get one if it’s going to be completely free? I don’t have to worry about trying to find a primary care practitioner who takes my insurance.” All the medals in the world can’t obscure the fact that the United States is the only high-income country without universal health care. So, as we come down from our Olympic high and continue to celebrate our beloved athletes (I would run through a brick wall for Jordan Chiles), let’s stop to think about the things that truly make a country great. Access to health care, education, voting, personal safety, freedom to love, the pillars of democracy — they’re worth their weight in gold."
Debunking Trump's claim that the presidency was 'taken away' from Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 1:45 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-stolen-election-joe-biden-kamala-harris-fact-check-rcna166247,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 10 episode of ""Velshi."" After Donald Trump and his allies spent months dragging President Joe Biden for his age and mental acuity, they appeared to be caught flat-footed when someone younger and sharper took over the ticket. Now according to Trump, Americans are being ripped off because, get this, the campaign was stolen from Biden. Hearing Trump say that he cherishes the Constitution is pretty rich but this isn’t the first time he's made this claim. Trump has posted on Truth Social alleging, “the Democrats have Unconstitutionally taken a Candidate ... and unceremoniously replaced him with a new Candidate."" Team Trump has even likened the whole situation to a ""coup."" If you’re like me, you’ve been seeing versions of Trump’s lie all over social media. And maybe hearing it from your conservative uncle who likes to argue during family dinners. I don’t want to give credence to every ridiculous claim Trump throws out but this one seems worth debunking. So, for fact's sake, the presidency was not taken from Biden. Nor has Vice President Kamala Harris unconstitutionally robbed Biden of the Democratic nomination. In fact, the U.S. Constitution doesn't address the matter of party nomination processes. Here are some other talking points to politely provide to your extra-loud uncle: Biden won the vast majority of the Democratic delegates during the primary election process and clinched the presumptive nomination back in March. But he was not formally the Democratic nominee — he was the presumptive nominee. This allowed him to, after much consideration, step aside voluntarily. He was not kicked off the party ticket and while the whole gambit might’ve been a politically risky move, there’s nothing illegal about it. When Democratic primary voters selected Biden, Harris’ name was attached to his name and they chose her as vice president — you know, the role that takes over for the president if needed. So the argument that the American public did not have a chance to vote for Harris is categorically false. Also, they will have a chance to vote for her, or not vote for her, on Nov. 5.  The Democratic Party has a lot of rules in place for a situation as serious as a presidential election. There are rules for this exact scenario. Harris, in order to officially take Biden’s place on the ticket, needed to secure support from at least 2,350 Democratic convention delegates, including those who already pledged their support to Biden, and the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders dubbed the “superdelegates.”  Lo and behold, she did that. The Democratic National Committee had a virtual roll call to make sure everything was squared away and it was announced that Harris secured enough delegate votes to become the party’s nominee. To avoid any complications when it came to the physical ballot — the Democratic Party held that virtual roll call to make sure that Harris’ name, along with that of her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could be printed on the ballots by an Aug. 7 certification deadline. If the Democratic Party wanted to replace its nominee after the convention, that would be a different story. Though it still wouldn’t be unconstitutional, because the Constitution is silent on party nominations. Anyone who tells you otherwise is woefully misunderstanding this process or being deliberately misleading. As the MaddowBlog's Steve Benen puts it: But if Trump wants to talk about things that are unconstitutional and an attempt to steal an election away from the people ... I would be happy to remind him of Jan. 6th.

Trump cites Judge Cannon in seeking compensation for the Mar-a-Lago search,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 12:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-legal-filing-mar-a-lago-damages-rcna166222,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon and the Supreme Court have already helped Donald Trump in his criminal cases. Now he's using them to support his request for civil damages, too. A lawyer for the former president is citing Cannon and the justices in a filing that serves as a precursor to a possible federal lawsuit stemming from the 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property and subsequent charges for alleged unlawful retention of national defense information and obstruction. The filing may be best understood as a political document — claiming, as it does, “political persecution” against the GOP presidential nominee. But it’s notable how it leans on Trump’s own judicial appointees to justify that persecution narrative — even if closer inspection reveals that their rulings might not support this civil effort, however much they have helped him in his criminal cases. Cannon dismissed the classified documents case last month on the grounds that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded — a decision that Smith is challenging on appeal. The former president also invokes the recent Supreme Court ruling granting broad presidential immunity from prosecution, arguing in support of his civil “malicious prosecution” claim that: That argument is a little difficult to follow. Putting aside the relevance of Garland’s legal foresight, the Supreme Court broke new ground last month with a new (and vague) presidential immunity test. Whatever anyone might have guessed the court would do ahead of time, it wasn’t apparent until long after Mar-a-Lago was searched and Trump was charged. Plus, while the high court said that presidents get at least some immunity for official acts, that ruling came in the federal election interference case — not in the classified documents case, whose charges relate to Trump’s post-presidency conduct. Cannon likewise broke new ground last month when she dismissed the classified documents case. But that ruling didn’t deal with the underlying merits of the prosecution or the court-approved search that Trump complains of in his civil filing. There’s also the fact that it’s a trial-level ruling currently on appeal. Even if it survives appeal, it’s still difficult to see how Cannon’s decision on Smith’s appointment and funding calls into question the Mar-a-Lago search, which predated Smith’s appointment.   Trump also cites Cannon and the immunity ruling in his civil “abuse of process” claim — his third argument, in addition to malicious prosecution and “intrusion upon seclusion” (essentially, an invasion of privacy claim). In making his abuse of process argument, Trump’s counsel writes that “the lack of appropriations, a lack of a constitutionally appropriate appointment, and the unconstitutional nature of prosecuting an immune former President reflect the misuse of the prosecutorial process for an inappropriate — that is, a political — end.” But again, even if the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling somehow affects the classified documents case, and even if Cannon’s dismissal is upheld on appeal, it’s unclear how these rulings — which came after Trump was searched and charged — signal legal abuse in retrospect. There’s more to say about this new civil filing, and it’s unclear if it will turn into a full lawsuit or what will come of it if it does. The reason that it doesn’t go straight into court is that this sort of legal action against the federal government, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, starts with filing a notice to the agency involved — here, the Department of Justice, which can respond within six months. Trump claims $15 million in compensatory damages for alleged harm from legal costs, and $100 million in punitive damages (though, perhaps importantly if this moves forward, courts have noted that punitive damages aren’t available in FTCA cases). Whatever the outcome of this development, if it does go to court, it could test the degree to which Trump's luck in some of his criminal cases may extend to a civil case.

We have more questions than answers about Trump campaign’s hack claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 12:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-hacking-trump-campaign-jd-vance-rcna166162,"Politico reported Saturday that last month it began receiving internal documents, reportedly assessed as authentic by two knowledgeable sources, that seem to have been hacked from within the Trump campaign. Also on Saturday, The Washington Post revealed that it had received similar documents two days before. The Trump campaign issued a statement Saturday asserting that it had been hacked and blamed Iran. As a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, I have questions. The documents in question reportedly include a 271-page research document containing the results of Trump’s vetting of vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Forbes referred to that document as Vance’s “dirty laundry dossier,” implying that it might contain information painting Vance in a more unfavorable light than the struggling candidate is already in. Politico provided intriguing details of the email it received offering the material:  “The person said they had a ‘variety of documents from [Trump’s] legal and court documents to internal campaign discussions.’ Asked how they had obtained the documents, the person responded: ‘I suggest you don’t be curious about where I got them from. Any answer to this question, will compromise me and also legally restricts you from publishing them.’” Here are three questions that should be foremost on our minds as we process this alleged foreign attack on our election process. First, could it be true? Reports of the hack are eerily consistent with a report Friday from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center. Microsoft said Iran had “launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.” The Microsoft report then gets even more specific: “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.” That scenario reportedly matches the description of what happened to Trump’s campaign. Microsoft said it “notified those targeted.” Trump, on his Truth Social platform, said he was the person Microsoft had notified. Trump and Microsoft aren’t the only ones pointing to Iran. Just last month, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) publicly warned us of Iran’s intentions to influence the U.S. presidential election and to sow discord in America. When it comes to trying to mess with our election, this isn’t Iran’s first rodeo. According to a declassified ODNI report, in 2020 Iran “carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects.” As that election approached, Facebook announced it had disrupted Iranian and Russian operations aimed at U.S. election interference. Iran has the motive and means to carry out a cyber hack against the Trump campaign. The country wants revenge for Trump’s 2020 decision to assassinate top Qods Force general, Qassem Soleimani, by missile strike as he arrived in Baghdad. In fact, Iran doesn’t seek to simply eliminate Trump as a candidate but to eliminate him altogether. After the attempted assassination of Trump last month at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, we learned that U.S. intelligence agencies had detected an Iranian plot to kill the former president. On Aug. 6, a Pakistani man with ties to Iran was arrested by the FBI on charges of plotting to assassinate  a U.S. official not yet publicly identified. Second, what are the reasons to doubt that the documents were hacked by Iran? Despite all the evidence pointing to Iran, we don’t yet have the proverbial smoking gun, or laptop, in the hands of an Iranian operative. That kind of evidence may come soon, but in the interim, we might ask what else could have happened here? After all, the fruits of a successful state-sponsored malware attack against a presidential nominee ending up in the hands of a solely digital political newsroom might seem a bit, well, weird. And, while Politico may have been figuring out what to do with its unsolicited “gift,” whoever had possession of the documents may have grown impatient and forwarded it to the more traditional influencer, The Washington Post. Could someone within the Trump campaign have leaked the documents, and why? Well, a document containing potentially injurious details on the fledgling vice presidential pick could bolster calls for his ouster. Trump can’t like the fact that he has had to increasingly defend his choice of Vance. At least one former Trump staffer insists that Trump has to replace Vance, who has already been labeled a “historically unpopular pick.” Two things can be true at the same time. Iran is intent on interfering with our next election. Yet, could it also be true that, having been warned by Microsoft of the Iranian threat, someone with the Trump campaign decided to leverage that knowledge and leak some embarrassing data about Vance, then blame Iran? We don’t yet know the timing of Microsoft’s notification to Iran’s target, but we know Microsoft started spotting Iran’s efforts against the campaign in June. The hack, or appearance thereof, also allows Trump to play the victim — a role he seems to relish. If things don’t go his way in November, don’t be surprised if Trump blames Iran, the U.S. Intelligence Community, Politico and The Washington Post for his demise. Third, why should we care? Word of the Iran hacking allegation immediately triggered a tsunami of skepticism and even outright rejection of the claim across social media. The disbelief is understandable. Trump is a polished pro at lies and deceit, and the public, even when equipped with the latest intelligence on Iran’s cyber efforts, knows it can’t take anything Trump says at face value. The U.S. intelligence community is feverishly working to thwart foreign power attempts to disrupt our election. The FBI said it was “aware of the media reporting” on the Trump campaign incident, but declined to comment. That’s why I’m calling on the Trump campaign to fully cooperate with any FBI investigation of the alleged Iranian attack, if it isn’t cooperating already. The FBI should be as transparent as possible with its findings — given the constraints of classified details — as quickly as possible. If our intelligence agencies determine that Iran really did compromise the campaign of a major party's presidential nominee, and we’ve reached the point where we’re so distrustful that we can’t rally against a foreign adversary’s attack on our processes, the adversary wins. We know that the Department of Justice is already reticent to do anything that might affect the outcome of an election this close to Election Day, even including the opening of a counterintelligence or criminal investigation “related to politically sensitive individuals and entities.” But, not letting us know if a nominee — any nominee — has or has not been allegedly attacked by a foreign power may have the unintended consequence of depriving us of information we need to assess before we vote."
Trump's false claims about A.I. crowd photos are incredibly ironic,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 10:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ai-photos-harris-crowd-false-claims-rcna166229,"Seemingly stumped in efforts to stem the energy surrounding Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Donald Trump is asking voters not to believe what they can see with their own eyes. In social media posts shared Sunday, Trump falsely accused the Harris campaign of using artificial intelligence to generate images of large crowds at her events. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. He continued, saying, “She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the ‘crowd’ looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches. This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING.” To be clear: the crowds were real. The Truth Social post included an image from a Detroit-area airport rally that drew thousands of people, as NBC News reported. And while Trump said there was “nobody at the plane” when she arrived, you can see her being greeted by a large crowd as she steps off her plane in footage captured by NBC News. You can also see an image of her plane being welcomed by a large crowd here. And a Getty photographer confirmed the large crowd to The Daily Beast. Trump is no stranger to getting crowd sizes wrong. He's notoriously obsessed with inflating the crowds at his own events. And his claim that Harris was waving at nobody is particularly rich considering he's the one who has been captured in a video appearing to wave at nonexistent crowds in footage his campaign has shared to give the impression he’s immensely popular. It's also ironic that Trump is claiming that Harris is sharing A.I.-generated images for political gain when he and his followers have done just that. In one example, he used his social media platform to share an image that appeared to depict him praying in a church, only for the image to be called out as fake after people noticed he had six fingers on both hands. And Trump’s followers have shared other A.I.-generated images depicting him around Black people to give the impression he’s popular among Black folks. So his claims about Harris fit his pattern of accusing other people of doing things he has himself already done. But they also suggest his desperation over Harris’ apparent popularity is growing, as is his seemingly increasing public detachment from reality and his insistence that followers join him in undermining faith in democracy.  If he can convince his supporters that the photographs are fake, it's a short step to convincing them that any votes for her in November are bogus, too."
"‘And really, THAT song?’: Céline Dion rebukes Trump’s use of ‘Titanic’ anthem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 8:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/celine-dion-titanic-song-trump-rally-rcna166211,"Céline Dion has joined the long list of musicians who have rebuked the use of their music at Donald Trump’s campaign events. After a video of Dion performing her hit song “My Heart Will Go On” was shown at Trump’s rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday, the Canadian singer expressed her disapproval in a statement posted on X. “Today, Celine Dion’s management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc., became aware of the unauthorized usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at a Donald Trump / JD Vance campaign rally in Montana,” Dion posted.  “In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use. …And really, THAT song?” The romantic ballad, released as the theme to the 1997 film “Titanic,” is an odd choice for a political rally, as campaigns generally avoid imagery of sinking ships. The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris took note of the irony, posting a video of the song playing at the rally with the caption, “Trump campaign plays the theme from the Titanic at his rally.”  The song was in keeping with Trump's more unorthodox approach to campaign music, which ranges from the usual patriotic anthems such as Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” to unexpected picks such as the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and musical theater numbers from “The Phantom of the Opera.” That wide-ranging taste has also gotten Trump in trouble. Since 2016, many prominent musicians have disavowed Trump’s use of their music at his campaign events  — so many, in fact, that there’s a Wikipedia page titled “Musicians who oppose Donald Trump’s use of their music.” Dion reportedly turned down an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration in 2017."

Hey, David, it’s great to be with you. David Jolly: I’m so excited to be with you. My only fear is you’re going to lose a lot of listeners by replacing Jen with me for a week. That’s terrible news. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I know. And let’s talk about that just for a minute. Before we get in today’s show, I want to share the news that my amazing co-host here on “How To Win,” Jen Palmieri, has moved on from our family at MSNBC in this podcast to actually join the Harris campaign. So she’s going to take her wisdom and her good humor and her expertise to literally sort out how to win in 2024. We love you Jen and we wish you all the best. And we hope to have you back to say hello between now and the election. Go get them. And now onto today’s episode, the countdown continues. Today marks 89 days to the election and Vice President Kamala Harris is officially the democratic nominee. So David and I want to break down the latest from her campaign, how she’s doing and why she’s been underestimated. And also, how Trump seems to be flailing. I mean, flailing, what was once his race to lose. And Jonathan Martin is going to join us to talk about the excitement around the VP pick. The teacher, the coach, the veteran, the governor, Tim Walz, and what he brings to the campaign. But first, we’re going to go to the strategy session. We do this David, where we talk about, if we were in the room, what would we be advising? What would we be telling the campaign that we think they ought to do? And so let’s talk about first of all, what do you think they’re doing right and what do you think they’re doing wrong? David Jolly: I think if you’re vice president, keep doing what you’re doing. You’re doing everything right, right now. I mean, it is a remarkable chapter in her candidacy. You know, I think one thing that she needs to address, which we’ll talk about with Jonathan is this issue of not sitting down for an interview yet. Look, she’s been very busy. There’s been a lot going on in the vice president’s world so, it’s understandable she hasn’t sat down for an interview, but kind of that Lester Holt conversation that the country needs to see, when is that going to happen? And then I think the other curiosity I have is we are a nation that is watching a lot of global conflicts, and we play a leadership role in each of them from Ukraine to the Middle East, but also some tinder boxes elsewhere. You know, the vice president has four years of great experience working on national security issues with Joe Biden. What will she demonstrate with her voice and her ticket about her leadership on the world stage? I think those are two open matters for her, but they’re not detracting from anything right now. I think it’s just what’s coming up next. But as for right now, keep doing what you’re doing because you’re winning this race doing what you’re doing. Claire McCaskill: If I were in the room, I would tell them to try to continue to bang on Republicans for Harris. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: They got a pretty good swing at that this week. As somebody who knows most of the people well that are part of the Republicans for Harris group, what else can they be doing? And do you think they got a chance of getting pins? Give us your take on that. David Jolly: I don’t think that no, I don’t actually. And this is where there’s a lot of euphoria around Vice President Harris right now and there should be. But the reality is you’re down the line Republicans like Pence and others. A lot of these former senators are still looking to save the Republican party, and they can’t do that if they actively support Vice President Harris. But the fact that they’re staying out, the fact that they’re not supporting Trump, you can ask hard questions about that decision itself, but it is a hard reflection on Donald Trump. And I think what this Republicans for Harris speaks to most importantly, is the coalition that’s available to Vice President Harris. You and I, Claire, talked about this at one point a few weeks ago, whether or not the Biden coalition instantly transfers and the Biden coalition is a little different, right? That was the soul of America coalition. That was four or five years in the making the Harris coalition now includes this entirely new energized wing from young people to voters of color, to the people you see at the rally in Atlanta and Philadelphia, that’s a different coalition than the Biden coalition. So I think if there’s an opportunity for the vice president to reach out and grow even more, it is in groups like this Republican for Harris and others that may have felt more natural being a part of the Biden coalition. People that would also vote for a Claire McCaskill, for instance. Claire McCaskill: Right. I think there are maybe five or six of those people still out there. I don’t know. So what about this Elon Musk thing and Trump? Should the Harris campaign just ignore all that? The Peter Thiel and the Elon Musk and these billionaires that are frankly behaving. I don’t even understand how crazy these guys are. Should they be paying any attention to that? And they don’t even need to worry about money at this point, right? I mean, I think Harris is in a commanding position in terms of raising money, low-dollar donations in amounts that this country’s never seen before. David Jolly: Yeah. I, I love that question. I’m curious your take on this as well, Claire, because you brought up money. I would say largely when it comes Trump, Elon and others, you can ignore most of what they say because the country sees it for what it is. Either it’s biblical truth for certain voters or it’s nonsensical for others. But I do think the two areas you have to pay attention to are money and misinformation and how do you quickly address those. On money, as you said, look, she’s going to be just fine it appears going toe to toe. The misinformation piece is really scary because we saw in Donald Trump over the past eight years and certainly in 2020, his willingness to create and use misinformation. And now, you have partners out there in the world particularly controlling platforms like X willing to do it as well. Is it your responsibility as a candidate to address the misinformation or to just out, you know, volume that misinformation? What’s your take on that? Claire McCaskill: I think it is very important that she keep the advantage she appears to have right now online. And the advantage her side has online is it so organic. And I mean, I have young people in my life that all they do is get their information from TikTok. I’m not proud of that, but it is what it is. And they tell me that the change in TikTok is remarkable over the last two or three weeks that it has gone from being dominated by a lot of misinformation, to a lot of stuff that is good for Harris and Walz. And as long as that’s occurring, I know they’re tracking that at the campaign. I think they’re going to be okay. If that gets back into an imbalance situation, that’s when the misinformation really has a chance to take root. And that’s when they’ve got to aggressively put some money behind correcting the misinformation. I think what they’re doing so far, you know, I saw her first bio ad by the campaign during the Olympics last night. It’s very good. There’s been a PAC running ads. I mean, if I’m seeing ads in Missouri, they’re seeing them everywhere in the country. David Jolly: Right. Claire McCaskill: Because I can assure you, they are not buying ads in Missouri. So, they’re not that dumb. They are buying ads obviously in the swing states heavily, but they’re also doing some national ads, which I think is brilliant. I think the idea that they’re spending some money on national ads makes sense. And you know, so far, I don’t know what the ads look like online in terms of misinformation or on the more traditional channels on the swing states. But so far, I don’t think anything they’re pitching is being caught by the American public. David Jolly: That’s right. Claire McCaskill: I think they’re in a pretty good place on the misinformation. I am scared about Elon Musk because when he tweets that Kamala Harris is a communist, you know -- David Jolly: Some people believe it, right? Claire McCaskill: -- some people actually believe it and it’s just so irresponsible. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I’m ashamed to say I used to own a Tesla. David Jolly: Hey Claire, let me ask you a question coming off of this week, the Walz announcement, the momentum continues for the vice president. At least in my words, I think you probably agree she’s doing everything right. This is just a remarkable campaign on jet fuel right now. I see two scenarios conflicting in my own analysis. One is kind of what I just described. That it almost feels like this race is over. That if this race is something beyond ideology, if it’s actually about what direction are we going? Are we all rowing in the same boat? Are we rooting for America or rooting against it? Who are we? Are we willing to tolerate racist language and racial undertones? Or are we actually better than that as a country? It almost feels like this coalition emerged that now is unstoppable, right? That’s one scenario that I think is really feasible. We might actually be in that scenario. The other scenario is, and I want to ask Jonathan about this, bring the enthusiasm back down a little bit and realize maybe America didn’t change two weeks ago. It probably didn’t. Are we still just a 50-50 race? And is this still Donald Trump’s to lose or has the ground truly shifted among the American electorate? Those are two competing scenarios. How do you see it? Claire McCaskill: Well, I am guilty of being an optimist. I am guilty of continuing to believe in this country. I am guilty of believing that a lot of the 50-50. I’m not saying it was ever 60-40, but I think it’s probably closer to 55-45 on the side of optimism, opportunity, positive things, not grievance and you know, appealing to the lowest common denominator playing to the cheap seats. So I actually think that a lot of the 50-50 was in fact people who were worried about Joe Biden’s ability to be president at his age. And I think we’re not talking about how that has played in this. David Jolly: Right. Claire McCaskill: The sense of relief that people had that are not Democrats or Republicans, that really don’t like Trump, really don’t like him, that they couldn’t really get comfortable with the idea that somebody that old was going to have that big a job. And I think that it’s not just that she’s done a great campaign. It is that sense of relief that she’s really bounced. I pay a lot of attention to the cross tabs on independence because I lived and died by independence. David Jolly: Right. Right. Claire McCaskill: I never would’ve got elected statewide in Missouri without winning independence. So I focus on that and the independence have really popped. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know, when you moved independence 10 points in two weeks that says a lot about Kamala Harris, but it also says a lot about how worried people were about Joe Biden’s age. David Jolly: No, that’s right, Claire. And I actually think for Donald Trump, and I really mean this, the spark is gone. I mean, I use the analogy or a metaphor, whichever one it is of relationship that started eight years ago based on a spark, based on something that people just felt, and they don’t feel it anymore. That spark is gone. And you know it well as anybody, as a practitioner of politics, when you’ve got the momentum, you’ve got the spark, people want to be a part of it. They want to be with a winner, right? That’s the Harris campaign right now, Donald Trump’s the losing campaign that was eight years ago. Claire McCaskill: Charlie Sykes coined the best term of all for Donald Trump’s campaign right now. He’s in the fat Elvis stage of his career. David Jolly: I know. It’s perfect. Claire McCaskill: It’s just perfect. People are tired of him. People are really tired of him. David Jolly: Yeah, that’s right. Claire McCaskill: Before we get to our guest, II got to mention the bear, the dead bear, the dead bear carcass in the back of the van. You know, when you really think about the story he told, RFK telling Roseanne Barr, I mean, this is like a “Saturday Night Live” skit. I’m sure it will be. You know that he was falconing or hawking or something and a dead bear and it ended up in his car. And then he had to go to Luger’s for a fancy steak dinner and no time for a shower. And he had his hand inside the bear’s bloody mouth and then he thinks it’s a good idea, but he drops by Central Park and happens to have a bike in the car. And then somehow the bike and the bear end up in the park and then he ends up to going to Luger’s. And then he is got to get to the airport. And you know, I mean, Tim Miller did a hysterical bit with Sam Stein on this, you know, as an assassination type moment by moment analysis of the tape of him explaining this. I mean, this guy is going to end up at 1 percent. I predict he’ll end up at 1 percent David Jolly: And there’ll be 1 percent from Trump because here’s what I’ll tell you from his vaccine denialism to a dead bear, RFK, Jr. keeps doing everything possible to take voters from Donald Trump. Claire McCaskill: Exactly. David Jolly: He’s not taking voters from Kamala Harris. Claire McCaskill: They love the dead bear. They love skinning a dead bear and eating bear meat. I know those people. We have a bunch of them in Missouri. And there’s nothing wrong with it. Nothing wrong with it. You can hunt and skin and eat bear meat all you want as long as it’s legal. I would not be recommending dumping the carcass in Central Park, however. All right. We’ll pause here. Up next, “Politico’s” politics bureau chief Jonathan Martin joins us to give us take on Governor Tim Walz after seeing his debut with Vice President Harris. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. My co-host former Congressman of Florida’s 13th congressional district, David Jolly, is still with me. So David, after a couple of weeks of veep vetting by Vice President Harris and her team, we have emerged with coach put that one first, veteran, put that one second, teacher, and then like a little bitty letters, Congressman and governor -- David Jolly: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- Tim Walz as her choice. After a kickoff Tuesday in Philly, they hit a Midwest tour of Wisconsin in Michigan. Jonathan Martin was there in Philly as Coach Walz was introduced to voters and he joins us now. He’s the politics bureau chief and senior political columnist at “Politico.” And previously, Jonathan was the national political correspondent for “The New York Times.” He’s also the co-author of “The New York Times” bestseller, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future,” which focused on the 2020 election and its aftermath. Welcome, Jonathan. And by the way, it’s not in his biography, but he’s like in everybody’s ear. He’s kind of obnoxious. Like no matter what’s going on, I usually hear from Jonathan, and I know he only has about 400 people like me. This is a guy who has tentacles that are constantly squirming out there in the world of politics, pulling in all the little creatures he can into his world. So he knows more than everybody else. Jonathan Martin: Oh, Lord. Claire McCaskill: And he is very hard to say no to. I mean, because you know, he’s kind of Midwest nice, like Coach Walz. David Jolly: I love it. Claire McCaskill: So welcome, Jonathan. Jonathan Martin: Of all the Introductions I’ve ever had, that is the most recent as the old joke goes. No, that is high praise. Senator, thank you so much for that compliment. I’m quite vivid, but I’m grateful to be on the pod. Thank you for having me. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. It’s nice of you to come. Okay, so you talked about the kickoff in Philly with the headline Harris chooses comfort food, will America bite? And I’ve been calling him mac and cheese in a trip to the hardware store. So we’re thinking the same way. Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: Give us your bottom-line takeaways. Jonathan Martin: I think the far-right and the far-left were so wrong about this pick. She didn’t snub Shapiro because he’s Jewish and she didn’t pick Walz because she was suddenly taken with the righteousness of the Palestinian cause and wanted to stand up to the sort of centrist of the Democratic Party and show her like diehard left-wing roots. Both those lines are BS. She picked him, Walz, because she had a personal connection with him. She had chemistry with somebody who’s the same age as her, who I think frankly is kind of an upper Midwest version of Doug Emhoff. He’s an affable, decent normal guy who she could connect with. And also frankly, Claire, who wasn’t going to overshadow her, who was a compliment to her. And I think that that had everything to do with this. And by the way, that debut in Philly, I think vindicated her assessment because it shows Shapiro’s chops and the how Shapiro could in fact, overshadow her. And it demonstrated how Walz I think is a good compliment to her, classic Midwestern, small town teacher, coach, veteran with a liberal California prosecutor. It makes sense. And so I think that was her thinking and I think, you know, so far proven to be right. David Jolly: Hey Jonathan, can we jump on the Philly -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- event for a minute because we saw Josh Shapiro with all of his -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah, exactly. David Jolly: -- and all of his loyalties, right? I mean, what’s amazing is all of the contenders for vice president really stuck together, even hosted rallies without Harris leading into the event. At the same time, he didn’t have a choice, right? He had to be. Had he not been there, it would’ve been a story. Jonathan Martin: Yes. David Jolly: And so he was there with five days to go the Harris-Walz ticket, watched Shapiro, working the Keystone state, very hard, going through Pennsylvania to win this thing. Do you see any daylight coming out of this? Some of the reporting that well, Shapiro, this is a perfect situation for him because now he can support the ticket, but not be tied to it. This is an ambitious governor who one day wants to run for the White House. You were in the room. What’s your read on the energy there? Jonathan Martin: I think it would’ve been a difficult relationship between the two of them if they had won because they’re so damn similar, right? They’re hard charging coastal lawyers and, I think it would’ve been scorpions in a bottle, frankly. And I think that sort of makes sense. Now, look, let’s not pretend like Tim Walz is somehow some shy and retiring figure. He said the right things during his interview with her and said he wanted to be helpful however he could. He had no greater ambitions. Give me a break. Okay. He’s a congressman turned two-term governor. He has plenty of ambition. He just knows what to say in the right places. But don’t tell me that Tim Walz wouldn’t love to be president one day, okay, because I’m sure he would. You don’t do that job if you don’t have at least some inkling on running for president yourself. But look, if you’re Shapiro, the ticket wins this fall. You’re probably going to be a two-term Democratic governor of a really (inaudible) state, unless something happens in 2026, and he loses his re-elect. And then you’re looking at 2030, and he’s still going to be a fairly young guy at the doorstep of 60 by then and could certainly run for president in ‘32. So that’s a long ways away. And obviously, if Harris loses this fall, Shapiro’s going to be top of the list, David, for ‘28. David Jolly: Yeah. And I asked that very quickly, Claire, because what has been amazing since all of the conversation around Biden to now is how all of the principles leading principles in today’s Democratic Party have kind of done everything, right? We talk about how Harris has done everything, right. But you know, Harris’ VP stuck with Biden, defended Biden. Walz was the Democratic Governors Association spokesperson who walked out of the White House and said we’re with Joe. And then as it all shifted and Harris was the presumptive nominee, all of these key players with their own ambitions also rallied around the vice president. It’s been a really remarkable moment for democratic unity. Jonathan Martin: Nothing focuses the mind like the thread of a political hanging, right. David, I mean. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. You know, I will tell you that I was in a weird, weird position for two weeks. David, as you know, painfully, we were on panels together where I was meekly, but affirmatively stating in every way I could, other than he must drop out that we had a problem, and it had to be addressed. And what I knew that a lot of people didn’t know is how furiously people were working behind the scenes in ways that were productive. And I will just say this, and I don’t know if Jonathan Martin will agree with me, but Chuck Schumer doesn’t get enough credit. He really doesn’t. Chuck Schumer was doing everything that he needed to do, including saying all the right things publicly, doing all the right things privately, getting all the battleground states polling done about a week out so they had that data. And it’s a blessing curse, but in this instance, a blessing that we have real Senate races in every single state that she has to win. So, yeah, I’m proud of the democratic leadership and how this has all come through. And I think the reasons Jonathan gave for her picking him are exactly right. He augments her. He doesn’t mirror her. And you know, I will say, I think maybe the only person who might be slightly disappointed is Amy Klobuchar. Jonathan Martin: Your classmate. Claire McCaskill: I know. I know because this makes her path forward a little difficult because I think we all know she would like to run again someday, but she’s close friends with Tim Walz and I know she’s enthusiastic about him being vice president. Jonathan Martin: Claire, it’s good that you mentioned Schumer because of course, Schumer was one of the fathers of the class of 2006. He was one of the architects of that democratic wave that year that elected you, that elected Tim Walz, obviously, to the House, but elected Amy Klobuchar to the Senate. And yes, elected the two most vulnerable sitting senators, Sherrod Brown and John Tester whose faith this fall depends in part on Kamala Harris and Tim Walz running a strong campaign because you know, they can survive the top of the ticket losing to their states, but they can’t survive a debacle on the top of the ticket. So all roads lead back to the class of 2006, at least when it comes to the politics of 2024. I think you’re right on Chuck. I mean, he obviously went out to Rehoboth, to Biden’s summer house and had a clearly frank and candid conversation as they say diplomatic circles. And I think everybody in politics knew that if Biden had not dropped out that Sunday afternoon, then Schumer and Pelosi and Hakeem Jeffries were going to be forced to take extreme measures that coming week and by extreme measures, I mean probably having to go public to some degree, demanding Biden drop out. Biden took the sort of better part of valor and made it a sort of difficult month, slightly easier on himself, still humiliating. But obviously, it could have gotten a lot worse that week. And I do think Schumer and company were going to have to go further if Biden hadn’t dropped out. Claire McCaskill: Do you think they made a mistake in Philly not mentioning Joe Biden’s name? Jonathan Martin: I do. Yeah. I think that would’ve been a nice touch on the top of the VP’s remarks to have tipped a hat to him. Let’s be honest. Philadelphia is basically Biden’s backyard. It’s his de facto sort of major Metro areas. Campaign was based there in 2020. His wife is from there. It would’ve been a nice touch. I got to thank Claire that she’ll use her acceptance speech in Chicago to do a nice homage to Biden, but you’re right, missed opportunity in Philly. David Jolly: So Jonathan, let me ask you a question. This is where my political coalition, if you will, now that I’m out of office as an independent -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- is I ally with the democratic coalition though I’m not one. And so that’s also where on this matter, I was a little more quick to just accept the direction it was going until I was told it was going another direction. Claire much more experienced at the backroom dealings on some of this stuff. But if you look at this Harris-Walz ticket and how it’s setting up, I do wonder if there are vulnerabilities around national security at a time when there are wars breaking out in the world, the Middle East really is a tinder box that could change tomorrow. You do have two candidates in Harris and Walz with experience, with national security chops. Obviously, the sitting vice president with her four years. Walz with his career as a National Guardsman and all the work he’s done on behalf of veterans as well. I realize it’s not the most poll tested issue right now, but it’s one of those issues that kind of has to get attended to. Do you see the Harris-Walz ticket being able to address some of the concerns about global unrest or do you see them really getting to find in a Clinton-Gore domestic policy way and who chooses how they get defined? Jonathan Martin: Let me answer that, two ways, David. One, I think if we do have a wider war in the Middle East or some kind of God forbid, either breakout of hostilities in the Pacific in the next 80 days, then I think we’re going to see that question come front and center, who’s better suited to be commander-in-chief. You know, absent that, I think this is much more of a referendum on do you want Donald Trump back in office? Which frankly has been the defining question of American politics for nine years now, which is Donald Trump, which side are you on? It reminds me of like a modern, smaller scale, more limited version of the civil war in America for decades after the civil war in American politics. The only question was which side of the war were you on? And then nothing else really mattered, right? And like, you’re a great example of this. You were Republican Congressman from Florida, but obviously, you just can’t be for the Trump party anymore because that’s the defining question. It’s not right and left. It’s not issue based. It’s are you forward against Trump? I still think that’s central in some kind of a major national security conflict or the sort of mushrooming of the current conflicts going on. Lastly, I’ll just say this. I think Trump is going to use their debate if they do have one, I think it looks like that that they will, to say something along the lines of, you know, the world leaders, Putin or whatever, they’re not going to be scared of you. They’re going to laugh at you. David Jolly: Right. Jonathan Martin: I mean, I think that’s going to be one of Trump’s major lines of attack is to say that you can’t be commander-in-chief, that the world leaders wouldn’t take you seriously, right? And I’ll be really curious to see what her response is because she’s got to know that that’s coming, right? Claire McCaskill: I can’t wait. Okay. So next up, speaking of how Trump and Vance are handling this new ticket. Jonathan Martin: Not well. Claire McCaskill: We’re going to talk about that on the other side and what the polling trends look like. Back with David jolly and Jonathan Martin in just a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Okay. Welcome back. Former Republican and former Florida, Congressman David Jolly and I have been speaking with Jonathan Martin, who is the political politics bureau chief and senior political columnist. Let’s talk about Trump and the GOP’s reaction to the Walz pick specifically. It really seems really weak. And I got to tell you, that thing that he did yesterday, Vance, his instincts are not good. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: That running down the tarmac to like somebody in high school going, oh, yeah, that’s going to be my plane someday and, oh, she’s not answering questions. I mean, it looks so bush league. It did not look anywhere close to leader. I know he is trying to emulate, you know, tricks that Trump would do, but what’s your take on how these guys have tried to frame this race and how they fail to frame this race. Jonathan Martin: There’s a saying, as you know, Claire in politics about, you know, living off the land and when you don’t have a coherent singular message, you tend to live off the land. So when the stock market crashes on Monday, you’re living off of the Kamala crash. The economy’s going to hell on the hand basket. Oh, well there was a recovery on Wall Street, Tuesday, never mind. Okay, and now we’ll focus on Kamala is not answering questions from the press. So we’ll go over on the tarmac. It’s reflective of the lack of a consistent, straightforward message. It’s the economy, stupid, hope and change, compassionate conservatism, you know, restoring the soul of America. If you don’t have a coherent, straightforward bumper sticker pitch, then you’re going to be living with whatever the news cycle gives you day in, day out. Claire McCaskill: Like we won’t go back. Jonathan Martin: There you go. David Jolly: I actually would not be surprised Claire and Jonathan, if Trump tries to swap out J.D. Vance. Claire McCaskill: Really. David Jolly: I realize it’s really late and I realize there’s ballot type. Here’s why. This is a former president who fired senior officials by tweet. Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: Right? When he’s done with somebody he’s done. He also knows, the one thing he knows is showmanship is grabbing a news cycle. He’s smart enough to know that the vice president and Governor Walz have all the momentum right now, all of it. And the Trump campaign is in a free fall, and nothing is working for him. He has to have a reset. I really think he is in a free fall. And where does he get that reset? He’s not capable of changing kind of the racial undertones or outright racist language. He’s not capable of stopping the insults. The one thing he can do is try to create some type of news story for a couple weeks around swapping that. Jonathan Martin: Yeah. I’m really curious what he says if there’s news conference of Mar-a-Lago. But my instinct is that if he does make a change, it would probably be with his staff rather than Vance just because changing your VP pick is so much more disruptive and convulsive to the campaign. David Jolly: But we’re talking about Trump. Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: So Jonathan, let me ask you though a question following up on this because I do think in the horse race analysis, Trump’s in a free fall. Harris has all the momentum, they’re doing everything, right? So among democratic activists and voters and democratic allies, there’s a bit of a high right now that, wow, this is going to last. We’re going to win this thing. It’s over. This race is over. Fundamentally though, we know America didn’t change two weeks ago just because Biden stepped out -- Jonathan Martin: Right. David Jolly: -- and Harris stepped in. And you could argue the race is still Donald Trump’s to lose, but he’s just doing the things to lose it right now. Jonathan Martin: Yes. David Jolly: As a seasoned journalist, how do you read the room nationally on where this race really is? Jonathan Martin: A very competitive race. It’s an evenly divided country when you look at the Electoral College. Look, Trump is forever going to be a 46 to 47 percent plurality. He’s not going to sniff a majority in this country, but he doesn’t have to, like, we don’t have a popular vote. So yeah, it’s still a really close race because the map structurally tends to be stronger for today’s Republican coalition. It’s easier for them to find past to 270. And yeah, you’re asking the country to support a California liberal, which is not an easy ask, right? This is not Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp on top of the ticket. So it is tough when you go into places like Wisconsin and Michigan. It’s not impossible, but obviously, is not easy. I think Harris is going to need a lot of help from Trump. I think you’re right, David. I think Trump is capable of losing this race more than Harris is capable of winning it, you know? And he may do just that. Claire McCaskill: Well, I’m going to disagree with you a little bit there. Jonathan Martin: Please. Claire McCaskill: I actually believe, and you and I may have talked about this before, but I don’t think people appreciate the jungle that is California primary races. I don’t think people appreciate how hard it is as a Democrat to emerge, first to be the D.A. of San Francisco and then to be attorney general of California and then to become United States Senator. I mean, California is bigger than most countries and there are lots and lots of people who want to be what Kamala Harris has been in California. She is particularly good at this. And I think what happened to her is that her presidential race -- Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: -- did not go well for a lot of -- Jonathan Martin: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- complicated reasons that they’ll probably be several books written about now. Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: And then her first two years in the vice presidency were very rough and she was really taking it too much to heart that she was being diminished as vice president, but she has gone back to her skill set. And I watched her with those hecklers yesterday. She did really well. Her timing has been impeccable. Her choice of Walz has been impeccable. I really think she is much better at this still than people are giving her credit. I may not get it that she can lose this race, but I believe she can win this race too. Jonathan Martin: Let me say two things in response. One is I having covered her when she was the A.G. and Senator in California, you’re right. She’s more talented than her belly flop of a campaign in ‘20 and her rough couple of years in the White House show. She does have real talent. She’s proven that this week on the trail. I guess where I would push back a little bit is to say, yeah, she navigated the California thicket, but that’s a thicket that is like far-left, center-left and center. And it takes a certain level of dexterity, but you’re navigating basically everything that’s either from the center to the left. I think it’s tougher now because she’s not had the navigate places like you did, you know, go into a place like a Joplin, Missouri. That’s just not been what she’s had to do. And frankly, been ill served by the White House that has not put her in front of VFW conventions and Legion conventions but has had her doing entirely base oriented work for the last three and a half years. So she’s now got 90 days to appeal to a general election audience that she hasn’t really talked to in a long time. Claire McCaskill: I agree. I agree. And I mean, that’s a good point. I always think it’s better to have somebody on the ticket that is actually won in a state that’s hard. David Jolly: I’m very curious if we get to November and she indeed wins this thing, which I think she will actually. I think she’s going to win this race. And I think it’ll be part of Trump’s failures, but also her true talents and her hard work. I’m curious if voters elect Kamala Harris, not necessarily because we’ve had a broad ideology debate, but because they’re voting based on who we are as a country and who we want to be. There’s something bigger at play than the traditional left, right spectrum going on. Jonathan Martin: Absolutely. And Trump’s the stand in for that. David Jolly: That’s right. Jonathan Martin: It’s a, which side are you on question? Like, you know, do you find Trump to be somebody who reflects the country that you want to be a part of? It’s so much bigger than right versus left. And it’s why the Biden coalition is so precarious. I mean, because you create a coalition that includes the David Jolly’s of the world, like the Cheney family, all the way to like AOC, an actual socialist. Well, that’s a pretty ungainly coalition right there, right? It’s a powerful one because it includes like everything from, you know, Brooklyn hipsters to the Ladue country club player, but like it’s tough to sustain and it depends on Trump saying and doing crazy shit, you know? Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Well, I’m betting on it. I’m betting on the crazy shit. But before we go, I’d like your take Jonathan on, if you think this issue they’re trying to use on Walz is going to have any kind of impact whatsoever from a guy running for president that had bone spurs, this National Guard thing. Do you think this is a chance in hell of moving a number for him? Jonathan Martin: I think absent new and damning information, I’m skeptical. Look, if there are e-mails or if there are recordings of Walz talking about bailing from the Guard because he got word that they were going to be deployed to combat, I think it’s a much tougher scenario. I think absent that, I don’t think it’s going to pop. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I agree. You know, I mean, and let’s remember Vance was a war correspondent, not to diminish -- Jonathan Martin: Thank you. Claire McCaskill: -- people who write for a living, J-Mart. David Jolly: Exactly. Claire McCaskill: But this is no Jim Webb. Jonathan Martin: There you go. There you go. There you go. Claire McCaskill: Okay. David, don’t you think we should get Jonathan to opine about the polling before we go? David Jolly: Oh, I agree. That’s kind of where -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- I was going because I think everything’s going right for Harris and her numbers could hit 60 at this rate and trumps could hit 40 -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- because he’s so bad at this. And I guess that’s where the reality check from -- Jonathan Martin: Yes. David Jolly: -- from you, Jonathan. What does it take, let’s say for Trump to stop the bleeding, because if Trump doesn’t stop the bleeding, I presume you would agree, the polls don’t start to change if Trump doesn’t change his candidacy. Jonathan Martin: Yeah, which is why this debate matters and which is why I think Trump’s going to give in regardless of who broadcast it because Trump needs just like Biden did frankly this spring to change the conversation. And I think that a debate in which Kamala Harris has a bad moment or two could change the contours of this race. So, prepare America, I think we’re going to see a debate in September. David Jolly: Could I ask you very quickly on that, Jonathan, because I asked the national security question. Related to that, the Republican charge that she won’t sit down with the press. I mean, they’re really hammering on this issue that she has yet to sit down with the press. What’s your read on that as a member of the press? Jonathan Martin: Look, the longer she delays it, she just raises the stakes. If she and Walz were doing regular interviews on the campaign trail, forget national. Just do your affiliate stuff on the way, you keep the press at bay, and you lower the stakes. By doing this now it just raises, I think unwisely, it just raises the stakes for whenever they do a sit down and I don’t get why they’d want to do that. And I think frankly, it reflects a lack of confidence in the candidate. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. I think the affiliate anchors is what she should start doing, you know, 10, 15 minutes with affiliate anchors because they’re going to be, you know, as long as they don’t go to that kid in Colorado, that’s making a national name for himself. I think she would do really, really well. And frankly, I think she’ll surprise people in the interviews too. I don’t know why they’re hesitating. Jonathan Martin: She has been so much more confident this week than I’ve seen her in the three and a half years as vice president. It’s a whole new person, you know? Claire McCaskill: Okay. J-Mart, thank you so much for your time. Jonathan Martin: What a treat. Claire McCaskill: We are honored to have had you. And hopefully, we will talk to you again before we get to the end. Jonathan Martin: Would love to. Claire McCaskill: Okay. So Jonathan Martin is “Politico’s” politics bureau chief. And let me do this, don’t forget the book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump Biden and the Battle for America’s Future.” If you haven’t read it, I actually have, I don’t want to admit that to you because that’s a confession that you’ll probably use against me. I thought it was actually very, very good. So I recommend it for people who want to understand exactly what happened around 2020 and why it all matters today. So, thanks. Jonathan Martin: Thanks guys. Claire McCaskill: Yep. All right. And let do this. My guest co-pilot today, former Republican and former Florida Congressman David Jolly. Thanks for coming. David Jolly: Thank you. Claire McCaskill: Before we head out, two things. One, remember we have Tim Walz’s winning hot dish recipe in the notes for the podcast we did with him a few weeks ago.

Republicans’ 2024 case has three pillars. All three are collapsing.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-2024-election-inflation-immigration-crime-rcna165773,"Giving Donald Trump advice is much like attempting to steer a hurricane — neither will change course. Yet that hasn’t stopped Republicans from offering the former president what they think is a simple prescription to reverse Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum: Stick to the issues. Trump’s campaign “has sought to attack her on policy grounds while casting her as unfit,” reports The Washington Post. “The policy- and issue-related attacks would get more traction,” Republican pollster Neil Newhouse told The New York Times. But there’s a problem. The GOP’s policy argument against Democrats is built on three pillars: inflation, immigration and crime. Yet on all three fronts, the Republican case is collapsing. One of these pillars, crime, was admittedly in shoddy shape well before 2024. When Americans understandably worried about crime rates spiking during the pandemic, Republicans pounced on the issue. Even though crime rose in liberal- and conservative-run cities and states alike, the GOP hoped to reuse its old “soft on crime” playbook from the late 20th century to put Democrats on the back foot. Then crime rates fell in 2021 — and 2022 and 2023. Most recently, Justice Department data shows a 15% drop in violent crime in the first three months of 2024. According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the murder rate in nearly 70 large U.S. cities is down more than 8% since Trump left office. GOP attempts to run on reducing crime were always going to be complicated after their presidential nominee was convicted of 34 felony counts. But the data should make it impossible. I say “should” because for Trump, crime isn’t really about crime; it’s about Black and brown people doing crime. Crime and immigration are essentially inseparable to him — and indeed the entire right-wing media machine. And with unlawful border crossings much higher for most of President Joe Biden’s tenure than under other recent presidents, conservative attacks on immigration have gone into overdrive. So worried were Senate Democrats that earlier this year they reached a border agreement with their Republican counterparts heavily tilted toward GOP priorities. Then Trump killed the deal at the last minute anyway so he could keep campaigning on the issue. Instead, Biden issued an executive action that heavily restricted the number of asylum-seekers allowed to remain in the U.S. But even before Biden announced that new policy, unlawful crossings were already declining. Last month, the Border Patrol made 56,000 apprehensions, the lowest since the fall of 2020. “Shelters on the southern U.S. border and in some major cities that were inundated with migrants a year ago say they are seeing sharp declines in migrants seeking refuge,” reported NBC News on Friday, “some reporting drops as high as 60% in just the past few months.” How long this decline continues remains to be seen. The U.S. is counting on Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to continue that country’s stepped-up enforcement against non-Mexican immigrants trying to reach the countries’ border. And as Dara Lind wrote for MSNBC about Biden’s action soon after it was announced, “generally, a crackdown engenders a ‘wait and see’ period [among would-be migrants] of a few weeks or months,” after which “the deterrent effect fades.” Our immigration system needs a complete overhaul, including far more resources. But for the moment, Democrats will take the good news. That leaves the most important issue to voters: inflation. Sustained inflation rates not seen in years provided Biden’s greatest political obstacle aside from his age. Though polls show voters trust Harris far more than Biden on the issue, the GOP would like to change that. Republicans have wildly overstated how much fault lies with government spending, when corporate price hikes and Covid-induced supply shocks deserve far more of the blame. But they had every reason to be confident in using the issue as a cudgel against the Democrats. “You have people dying financially because they can’t buy bacon,” Trump claimed (wrongly) at his low-energy press conference Thursday. “They can’t buy food, they can’t buy groceries, they can’t do anything.” Yet even shortly after inflation’s peak, the GOP underperformed in the 2022 midterms — suggesting voters didn’t believe that electing Republicans would slow the rise in prices. With each passing month, the case has weakened: In June 2023, the annual rate of inflation dropped to 3%, where it has hovered ever since. The consumer price index dropped 0.1% between May and June, the first month-to-month decline since the pandemic. Even mortgage rates — which are not included in inflation statistics but are a key cost for millions of prospective homebuyers and sellers — hit a 15-month low last week. By itself, the declining rate of inflation might not be enough. Millions of Americans still struggle furiously to make ends meet. But Trump has further undermined his own party by refusing to walk back his calls for sweeping tariffs — 10% on all imports and 60% on Chinese-made goods. (He has even suggested using tariffs to replace income taxes.) Economists on both the left and right say these tariffs would only exacerbate inflation. Add it all together, and the GOP case on inflation has become as laughable as the idea that Trump has ever done his own grocery shopping. Not since the early years of the Great Depression has news cut so uniformly against one party’s case for power. Republicans’ best hope was that the former president could win the same way he did in 2016: in spite of himself. With roughly three months to go, there’s still time for some news event to change matters, as Jim Comey’s letter did in 2016. But as of now, real-world trends won’t save Trump. Given his tenuous relationship to reality, that’s entirely appropriate."
Brittney Griner’s Olympic story is a real-life hero’s journey,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 10:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/brittney-griner-gold-medal-basketball-team-usa-rcna165817,"Brittney Griner had a moment while standing on the medal podium after she and Team USA defeated France 67-66 in a nail-biting Olympic gold medal game. She let all of the tears pour out of her while she listened to “The Star-Spangled Banner” and watched the United States’ flag rise to the top of the rafters. She stood tall with a gold medal on her neck and her hand on her heart. USA Basketball’s women’s national team had just made history winning its eighth straight gold medal and Griner had just won her third. DeWanna Bonner, a former teammate of Griner’s and a current forward for the Connecticut Sun, had foreshadowed the moving scene that took place in Paris on Sunday for the 33-year-old Griner. “I’m pretty sure to hear that national anthem and that gold medal going around her neck is gonna mean so much more to her than probably anybody else in that arena,” Bonner told me July 19, the day before the WNBA All-Star Game. Why did winning in Paris and keeping Team USA’s dynastic gold medal streak alive mean so much for Griner? “My country literally saved my life,” she said during WNBA All-Star weekend in Phoenix before flying to Europe for her third Olympic Games. “And now I’m able to represent them again, and it just means so much more. So much more.” Two years ago, Griner couldn’t have imagined that she’d be winning a gold medal for the U.S. or even playing basketball at all. She was still reeling from a nine-year prison sentence from Russian Judge Anna Sotnikova after she was found with two cartridges of hash oil at a Moscow airport. Griner, wrongly detained in Russia, thought she’d still be serving that full nine-year sentence. She was finally released in December 2022, after spending 293 days as a Russian prisoner, when the U.S. swapped her for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. What Griner has gone through in the past couple of years has been nothing short of a “hero’s journey” that is as extraordinary as any fable or piece of Greek mythology. It sounds too remarkable to be true, but it’s a moment in American history that shouldn’t be forgotten. Griner will leave this Olympics as an American hero and a public servant not just for what she did on the court during the United States’ six-game Olympic run, but also for how she has influenced the United States off the court. What makes an American hero? Sacrifice of self, cultural influence and service to community, according to journalist Antonio Olivo. Let’s see how Griner fits the bill. While Griner was detained, and after she returned to the U.S., she and her wife, Cherelle, raised substantial awareness across the U.S. about what the families of wrongfully detained Americans go through. The partnership that the Griners have with the Bring Our Families Home campaign was instrumental in making sure there was pressure on the White House not to forget about the other Americans detained abroad. On Aug. 1, she and Cherelle were transported back to 2022 when they heard the news that President Joe Biden had pulled off yet another prisoner swap and brought home Americans Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva. They got the news just as Griner and Team USA were about to play Belgium in the group stage. “It’s a great day,” Griner said after Team USA won that game 87-73. “Head over heels happy for the families right now. Any day that Americans come home is a win.” Before the 2024 Paris Olympics, Griner talked to NBC News’ Liz Kreutz, who asked her what she wanted people watching the Olympics to know about her. “That BG is locked in and ready to go,” Griner replied. “I’m happy. I’m in a great place, I’m representing my country, the country that fought for me to come back. And I’m going to represent well.” Griner has represented well but not in the typical way that WNBA fans are used to. On what is the hardest basketball team in the world to make, Griner didn’t start for Team USA in the Olympics and averaged around 14 minutes per game while averaging 7.3 points per game. She wasn’t the No. 1 option, but that doesn’t mean she didn’t make an impact. When A’ja Wilson’s shots weren’t falling, Griner would position herself to get the putback. When Team Nigeria’s top scorer, Ezinne Kalu, picked off a pass meant for Griner, the 6-foot-9 center with a 7-foot, 3.5-inch wingspan didn’t stop. She ran as fast as she could and blocked Kalu’s layup on the other end. Griner thrived doing the little things rather than every play being run through her. Heroes don’t consciously think of themselves and don’t stray from their sense of commitment. Overseas for the first time since being wrongfully detained, Griner put her teammates and the fans who graciously sought her autograph above herself. In an interview before Team USA’s semifinal game against Australia on Friday, head coach Cheryl Reeve touched on how Griner always makes time for the people around her. “I think that the reception that she gets and the warmth that she feels for her is something that is incredibly meaningful that she’ll always remember,” Reeve said. “I think what she went through we all sort of haven’t forgotten. … It’s a part of her every day. That will never leave her.” American heroes make major impacts on the nation, on society and in their communities. In addition to raising awareness about a political issue that wasn’t previously getting enough attention in the news, Griner’s presence and desire to tell her story affects young women all over, and especially young women who don’t fit feminine stereotypes. “Women come in all different shapes and sizes, all different packages, and so for her to share that, regardless of what people say or what people see, she is just a different brand of woman,” said Jonquel Jones, a friend of Griner’s and a player for the New York Liberty. “I know that there’s gonna be kids out there that want to be able to see themselves in somebody like her, that can inspire so many.” Griner’s intent to serve the communities around her will continue as the WNBA’s Players Association determines if it will opt out of its current collective bargaining agreement. According to The Ringer’s Mirin Fader, Griner has taken more of an interest in working with the Players Association to help shape the future of her union, including seeking higher salaries so that WNBA players don’t have to go to other countries to make money in the league’s offseason like she did. In Griner’s most recent memoir, “Coming Home,” which details her ordeal in Russia and her adjustment back to American life, she explains that she believed she had let down her family as a result of accidentally carrying hash oil, which she’d used for the chronic pain she developed as an athlete. “The Griner name was now stained around the globe,” she wrote. “Dope head. Drug dealer. Dumb. I hurt because I knew I handed the world a weapon.” But the Griner name is anything but “stained.” It’s a name that ought to be uttered with honor. The White House should consider honoring Griner with a Presidential Medal of Freedom, a high honor that recognizes “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.” Griner has done all of the above."

It’s obvious Republicans have no idea what to do about Tim Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-extremist-trump-maga-popular-rcna165895,"According to an actual tweet from the New Hampshire Libertarian Party, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Vice President Kamala Harris chose as her running mate last week, “has been a leech his entire life.” The message proceeded to list the various self-serving positions Walz has held, including “public school teacher” and “veteran.” If that sounds deranged, well, that’s because it is. The Trump campaign and its surrogates in the conservative media ecosystem have been desperately trying to paint the 60-year-old Walz as Che Guevara with a Midwestern accent. “This is the most woke, left-wing candidate she could have picked, out of all the names that surfaced,” former American Conservative Union head Matt Schlapp said. That’s obviously untrue. If Harris wanted to swing hard left, she could have chosen any number of progressives: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sens. Sherrod Brown or Bernie Sanders, or even twice-failed former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. They were all about as close to her short list as I was to starting as power forward for the New York Knicks. Instead, she picked “a Norman Rockwell painting sprung to life,” David Axelrod, the mastermind of former President Barack Obama’s political rise, quipped the other day on NPR. On Thursday, Trump held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in which he described Walz as dangerous and out of touch with Americans. In fact, Walz is firmly within the American consensus when it comes to actual policy: He is strongly in favor of reproductive choice, as are 85% of Americans, to some extent; Walz enacted paid family leave, another wildly popular policy; as governor, he has pushed for Minnesota to get its energy from renewable resources, in keeping with Americans’ growing recognition of the threat posed by catastrophic weather and elevated temperatures. If anything, Walz is so thoroughly in the center lane of the policy mainstream that even calling him a progressive may be something of an overstatement. Republicans, on the other hand, want to all but abolish the administrative state (through the Schedule F executive order Trump signed during his first term and hopes to implement in his second) while hounding women who cross state lines to seek abortions. Their version of freedom involves imposing a severe form of Christian nationalism on the country at large. And rather than even try to sell these radical ideas to ordinary Americans, they characterize dissenters as “childless cat ladies” or literal demons. Still, the GOP is trying to paint Walz as the Marxist from Minnesota. Bless their hearts. One loony right-wing activist suggested that Walz changed the flag of Minnesota to resemble that of Somalia. At some point you really have to wonder: How stupid do these people think we are? Judge for yourself. Walz would “unleash HELL ON EARTH,” Trump warned with his trademark restraint. If “hell on Earth” is making lunch free for children in public schools and legalizing cannabis, then Walz is indeed guilty as charged. He is a Midwestern progressive, in the tradition of Robert La Follette, Eugene McCarthy, Paul Wellstone and Al Franken. And he exudes genuine American warmth, the kind that was so refreshing to me and my family when we arrived here from the Soviet Union. “Tim Walz is the dad an entire generation wish[ed] they had instead of the one they lost to Fox News,” one social media user joked. The same country that welcomed my family, along with thousands of other Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union, could one day be led by JD Vance, who recently endorsed a book about how progressives are “unhuman.” Trump must be seething as the edgy, joyless Vance creepily follows Harris around the Midwest, where she and Walz have been drawing enormous crowds. At one event, a reporter asked Vance what made him smile. In response, Vance abruptly attacked the reporter, calling it a “bogus question.” Walz practically looks like JFK in comparison to this bearded disaster — and Trump must know it. “Republicans Simply Can’t Figure Out How to Knock Down Tim Walz,” went a recent Vanity Fair headline. Here’s a crazy idea: Don’t bother. Just offer better policies. Forget about Walz and simply tell the American people what you plan to do when you return to the Oval Office. Give them a reason to vote for you, and you won’t have to worry about the Democrats. For example, Trump tried to brand Walz as “Tampon Tim” for his support of transgender rights. As a matter of fact, Walz probably is to the left of most Americans when it comes to protections related to medical treatments for gender dysphoria. That gives Trump an opening — not to attack Walz, but to introduce ideas of his own. Of course, that’s very hard to do when your campaign is practically idea-free. So “Tampon Tim” it is. On the whole, I suspect Walz will provide a temporary boost to Harris in this critical early stretch while in the long run doing little to either help or hinder her campaign to any substantial degree. The right’s attacks on him are another matter. They reveal a paucity of ideas, a complete surrender to the Trumpian style of relentless attack. It’s an exhausting way to do politics. Even worse, it’s not very effective."
Why volleyball was one of the Paris Olympics' most underrated events,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/usa-vs-france-olympic-volleyball-primetime-paris-rcna165993,"The Paris Olympics draw to a close this weekend after two weeks of tragedy and triumph. But while many events (and athletes) have lived up to their top billing, I’d argue one sport remains conspicuously underrated. At a time when women’s sports are having a moment that is turning into a movement, and as the U.S. women’s volleyball team fights for the gold medal on Sunday against Italy, I believe more than ever that volleyball should be a featured sport of the Summer Games. For one thing, volleyball is arguably the only team sport that is quintessentially female. This is a relationship-based sport played with power and athleticism in a noncontact environment defined by interdependence and rapid scoring. It is also incredibly joyous, with encouragement and celebration a defining aspect of every play. There’s a reason that in the 50 years since Title IX opened athletics opportunities, girls have flocked to the court. Volleyball is also one of the only team sports in the U.S. to become mainstream without a more popular male counterpart. Per the National Federation of State High School Associations, more girls play volleyball than any other sport besides track and field. In August 2023, a college volleyball match drew the largest crowd in the world ever to attend a women’s sporting event as 92,003 fans crowded into Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium to watch Nebraska’s volleyball team beat Omaha in three sets. Indeed, the popularity of girls volleyball has led to a whole other opportunity for women in the NCAA. In 2012, beach volleyball was added to the NCAA’s “emerging sports” list and just four years later was made a championship sport. Today, almost 180 colleges support varsity beach teams, and the four women who represented the U.S. in Paris are products of American college teams. (Despite entering the Games with high hopes and higher expectations, both women’s beach teams were tragically bounced from the tournament earlier this week.) Nevertheless, the signs are clear. Volleyball and beach volleyball should be part of the prime-time Olympics rotation. Volleyball’s underrated status may have something to do with who is covering it. According to Richard Lapchick, chair of the DeVos Sport Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida, over 80% of sports editors, reporters and columnists were still men, at least in 2021. Nevertheless, we know the interest is there. In December 2023, the NCAA women’s volleyball championship was watched by 1.7 million people, a record for the sport. The Big Ten Network reported that volleyball was its third most popular sport behind football and men’s basketball — and that was back in 2019. Today, volleyball feels like it’s in the same place soccer was in not that many years ago. Media companies saw an opportunity and invested in coverage of the World Cup, the Premier League and MLS and NWSL matches. Today, most self-respecting sports fans can at least recognize offsides. Lionel Messi is a household name. The same could be true in volleyball — if the sport is given a chance. Television executives tend to be conventional thinkers and skew toward the risk-averse. But volleyball represents a real test of this burgeoning mainstream embrace of women’s sports. Can it become a success in the broader American marketplace? As an archetypal female sport and arguably the only major team sport not chasing a better funded, more broadly played, more widely understood male counterpart, volleyball is a litmus test. Can a women’s team sport not only survive but thrive on its own merits? Perhaps we will find out at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Fans and TV executives now have three years to familiarize themselves with hitting percentage, overlaps, and spread, commit and bunch blocking; we have three years to learn the names and the stories of star players like Kathryn Plummer, Jordan Larson, Annie Drews (and beach players like Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng). But in the meantime, the women’s team needs our support. Their match may not be featured in the prime-time lineup — it starts at 7 a.m. ET — but I know I’ll be watching."
Trump back in the White House would be very bad for the bears,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-endangered-species-grizzly-bears-gray-wolves-rcna164898,"Although former President Donald Trump has very  publicly distanced himself from the conservative Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 plan, we should take seriously much of what the 920-page document tells us about a potential second Trump term.   For one, if Trump wins in November, he may end federal protections for grizzly bears, gray wolves and the greater sage grouse, as the document proposes removing the three animals from the federal government’s list of endangered species. Environmental groups warn removing the species from protected lists would open them up to being hunted or killed by traps meant to protect farms and ranches while facing loss of critical habitat. Unsurprisingly, a politically-motivated group making decisions about protected and endangered species has the potential to create a ripple effect of problems.  As Andrea Zaccardi, a carnivore conservation legal director for the Center of Biological Diversity, points out, “The proponents of Project 2025 don’t understand that the protection of species is supposed to be a science-based decision and not a political one.”  Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973, the Endangered Species Act allows the federal government to protect species at risk of extinction from being killed, harmed or harassed. Once the population has rebounded, the species can be delisted, which leaves protection in the hands of state governments that environmentalists argue would not take strong enough action. Delisting endangered species is supposed to be done when federal scientists think it is no longer necessary, but it’s not unheard of to become political as well. Grizzly bears are a perfect example. Before western expansion, the lower 48 states had over 50,000 grizzly bears, with a range from Central Mexico to the Great Plains. But by 1975, when they were officially listed as an endangered species, the number of grizzlies in the continental United States had dipped below 1,000. Since then, they’ve been a success story, with a particularly successful effort to reintroduce grizzlies in a portion of Montana and the three states around Yellowstone National Park — the two areas where Project 2025 calls for delisting them. As of 2022, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem was estimated to have 965 bears, while the Northern Continental Divide in Montana was estimated at 1,138 — as much as triple the numbers in 1975. But the population of grizzlies has not improved much in two other ecosystems in Washington state and Idaho. Ivan London, a senior attorney at Mountain States Legal Foundation, said in an email that the grizzly bear should have never been listed under the Endangered Species Act in the first place. He argues that the government was wrong to divide the grizzly population into several ecosystems treated separately and should have considered the overall number of grizzlies in the entire United States. “The Endangered Species Act has turned into a lever of power that federal regulators use to extend their reach onto private and state property. This allows them to police activities that they would otherwise have no authority to oversee,” London said in an email. “Several ESA listings are based on outdated or otherwise questionable information, making the regulatory decisions to list or continue listing several species simply unreasonable. If the three species were delisted, the federal government would no longer have any say in protecting them. That would leave state governments entirely in charge of their future. For some critics of the listing, that’s the point. Mark Jones, national director for hunter outreach for Gun Owners of America, argues that the grizzly bear populations have rebounded enough that they should be delisted, and any effort to keep them on there is due to national politics interfering with the science. Jones, a Wyoming resident and a certified wildlife biologist, said that has “cheapened” the Endangered Species Act. “There’s a lot of resentment in Wyoming for the federal government because it’s ignoring its own law,” he said. But Zaccardi said there’s good reason to doubt that western states would take strong enough action. She notes that Idaho and Wyoming already passed laws that would allow trophy hunting of grizzly bears if they are delisted, while there would be strong incentives for state lawmakers to allow more killing of grizzlies and gray wolves, which will sometimes attack cattle and sheep. “The agricultural industry is not a big fan of predators,” she said. For now, grizzlies, gray wolves and the sage grouse are protected from trophy hunters, ranchers and real-estate developers. But that could change quickly if Trump wins in November, allowing politics to control an already politically charged policy. Ultimately, while some of the species have met the qualifications for delisting, the species are too fragile for removal.

At a press conference on Thursday, the former president attacked Vice President Kamala Harris and recounted having experienced an emergency landing in a helicopter with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, whom he claimed to know “pretty well.” (Trump has repeatedly questioned whether Harris’ career was boosted by her relationship with Brown, whom she dated.) “We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing,” Trump said. “This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was — he was a little concerned.” Trump’s account raised eyebrows, given that news of such an incident involving him and Brown, who is 90, had never been previously reported. Brown quickly denied the claim, telling NBC News that he’d never even been in a helicopter with Trump. At the time, some outlets, including NBC News, speculated that Trump may have confused the former San Francisco mayor, who is Black, with former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who is white. In 2018, Trump had been in a helicopter with the then-governor and his successor, now-Gov. Gavin Newsom, to assess the damage from wildfires to the town of Paradise. But both Jerry Brown’s and Newsom’s teams denied that that helicopter ride was ever endangered; Jerry Brown’s spokesperson also told NBC News that there had been no discussion of Harris on that trip. Then on Friday, Nate Holden, a former Los Angeles City Council member and state senator, told Politico that he had in fact been in a helicopter with Trump when it made an emergency landing in the 1990s, and suggested that the GOP presidential nominee had confused Willie Brown with him instead. “Willie is the short Black guy living in San Francisco. I’m a tall Black guy living in Los Angeles,” said Holden, 95. “I guess we all look alike.” Trump’s brother Robert and an executive from his company, Barbara Res, were also aboard the helicopter with Holden. Res wrote about the incident in her memoir, and she told Politico that although Trump liked to joke that Holden “turned white” from fear during the emergency landing, it was in fact Trump who was “scared s---less.” The controversy raises questions about Trump’s mental fitness. At 78, Trump is facing the same concerns about his age and mental acuity that he has previously attacked 81-year-old President Joe Biden for — concerns that his torturously rambling and misleading Thursday press conference did very little to allay. Trump has continued to insist that he is not misremembering which politician was with him on the helicopter. On Friday, he claimed to The New York Times that he had flight records (though he did not produce them) and threatened to sue the newspaper. The Trump campaign did not respond to an NBC News request for comment."
Jordan Chiles may lose Olympic bronze in floor exercise after sport court ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 12:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jordan-chiles-bronze-floor-exercise-appeal-romanians-rcna166093,"UPDATE (August 11, 2024, 7:20 a.m. ET): The International Olympic Committee said Sunday that U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles must return her bronze medal in the floor exercise, upholding findings that a coach’s protest that got her on the podium shouldn’t have been allowed. USA gymnast Jordan Chiles’ bronze medal in the floor exercise is in jeopardy after a sporting arbitration body determined that an appeal for her score in the category was incorrectly granted. In a ruling issued on Saturday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said an inquiry request from Chiles’ coaches had been submitted four seconds after the one-minute deadline and is therefore void, and consequently her points should be lowered to her initial score. Chiles had been given a 13.666 score for her performance on Monday, which put her in fifth place behind Romania’s two gymnasts. Team USA coaches quickly filed an inquiry as to the difficulty of one of her moves, a tour jeté with a full turn, and the judges raised her score to 13.766, bumping her to third place. The sudden change in Chiles’ score clearly shocked Ana Barbosu, the Romanian gymnast who initially had the third-highest score. Barbosu had been holding her country’s flag, ready to celebrate making the podium, when she was bumped to fourth place. The Romanian Gymnastics Federation later filed multiple appeals to the CAS challenging the score adjustment. The CAS said in its Saturday ruling that the International Gymnastics Federation will determine the ranking of the final and assign the medals according to the court’s decision. The FIG has yet to make any public comment about the ruling. USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee said in a joint statement that they were “devastated” by the CAS’s ruling. They said the inquiry was “filed in good faith, and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring.” The groups also objected to the online harassment of Chiles over the score appeal: Chiles’ Instagram posts have been flooded with comments accusing her of “stealing” an Olympic medal from the Romanian gymnasts. Her mother, Gina Chiles, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the 23-year-old has received “racist disgusting comments.” After the ruling, Chiles posted heartbreak emojis on her Instagram story. She also wrote that she was removing herself from social media for her mental health."
What’s behind the incredible turnaround of the U.S. women’s soccer team,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 10, 2024, 10:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-womens-soccer-brazil-olympics-soccer-final-rcna165777,"UPDATE (August 10, 2024, 1:06 p.m. ET): On Saturday, the U.S. women’s national soccer team defeated Brazil 1-0 to win the Olympic gold medal. This is Team USA’s fifth gold in the Summer Games and its first since 2012. Questions frequently surround the U.S. women’s soccer team after any disappointing result, but those questions have rarely been louder than after the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup last summer. The U.S. stumbled out in the round of 16, its worst finish ever at a major international tournament. Key stalwarts like Megan Rapinoe and Julie Ertz retired. Fans and critics alike wrung their hands about an uncertain future. As the gold medal match in the 2024 Olympics kicks off Saturday, the future now feels much more certain. After a 12-year absence from the Olympic finals, the U.S. will square off against Brazil in Paris. The team has been reborn under new head coach Emma Hayes, and a young roster has made the squad its own. How has one year made such a difference? The credit starts with Hayes, who came to the U.S. job with years of experience winning trophies at her former team, Chelsea FC. The hiring wasn’t entirely without risk: Hayes had never managed an international team, and her commitments with Chelsea meant she only had a few matches with the U.S. before the Olympics started. But the gamble paid off. Hayes built a reputation for making players feel as confident as possible about what they did on the field. And the quotes coming from the U.S. camp suggest Hayes has given them more belief than they have had in quite some time. “We’re a different team since she’s come in,” said star striker Sophia Smith after the U.S. beat Germany in extra time in the semifinal. “We just needed someone to come in and believe in us. … Emma’s doing exactly that.” Is the team winning because of confidence, or is it confident because it’s winning? Plenty of confident teams lose all the time, after all. What is clear is that Hayes is connecting with the players as individuals. Many coaches wouldn’t quietly surprise their players with a visit from a nail technician for manicures during the competition. The gold medal game will only be Hayes’ 10th game in charge, an unprecedented lack of time for a U.S. head coach at a major tournament. Things aren’t perfect yet, but the work she has done has already exceeded expectations. Hayes’ preference for youth over veteran presence has paid off as well, particularly with a reborn attack. Before the tournament, striker Alex Morgan, who has scored more than 120 goals for the U.S., was surprisingly excluded from the Olympic roster. But the forward line of Smith (23), Mallory Swanson (26), and Trinity Rodman (22) — the self-declared “Triple Espresso” — has scored or assisted 10 of the United States’ tournament-leading 11 goals. Swanson, returning after a yearlong injury layoff, fits Smith’s and Rodman’s playing styles like a glove. Their fluid movement and innate chemistry have made the U.S. more dynamic than it was a year ago. Admittedly, the U.S. has only scored two goals across the quarterfinal and semifinal. But it has been battling heat and fatigue, thanks to playing five games in 13 days, two of which went to extra time. The team will be at its most rested entering Saturday’s final. If the Olympics have seen the U.S. attack in third gear, imagine what the team will be like when it’s able to hit the turbo button. While the forwards may draw attention with their goals, it’s Smith’s good friend Naomi Girma’s defending that has made the U.S. so dominant in France this summer. Few defenders can cover as much ground as Girma does. Those who do usually get beaten by opposing attackers and leave their goalkeeper dangerously exposed. That never happens to Girma. Her positional discipline frequently cuts off dangerous attacks before they can even develop. When players do challenge her, she is never wrong-footed. When they run past her, she effortlessly catches up and wins the ball without fouling the opposition. “She’s the best defender I’ve ever seen,” Hayes said after the semifinal. “Ever.” The U.S. has conceded two goals all tournament and is the only team competing for a medal that hasn’t conceded in the knockout stage. Girma is a massive reason why. Just 24 years old, she’s probably the best defender in the world right now. What will happen on Saturday? There’s plenty of history between these two sides, including the gold medal games in both 2004 and 2008. The U.S. won both. More recently, the team also defeated Brazil 1-0 in the CONCACAF W Gold Cup final in March. Marta, arguably the greatest women’s soccer player of all time, will play her final game in a Brazil jersey and will have much of the crowd behind her team in Paris as Brazil tries to win its first-ever major title. With the Americans in the middle of a roster and coaching transition over the last year, nobody would have been surprised if they weren’t competing for a gold medal. But they are here, and they have reasserted their place among the absolute elite in international women’s soccer."
Chris LaCivita sunk John Kerry's presidential campaign. Now he's trying to 'Swift-boat' Tim Walz.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 6:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chris-lacivita-donald-trump-swift-boat-tim-walz-rcna166020,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 8 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.” Last month, Donald Trump looked ready to cruise back to the Oval Office. And now, Republicans can’t get people to stop calling them weird. Trump is melting down at Mar-a-Lago as he watches his poll lead evaporate against Vice President Kamala Harris.  At a time like this, a lot of campaign gurus might throw their old playbook out the window. But not Chris LaCivita — senior adviser to the campaign, known by insiders as one of Trump's top guys and the former president’s co–campaign manager.  For two decades, LaCivita has connected big Republican donors with candidates in trouble and helped them win with cutting personal attacks against their opponents. It’s a weird career niche that started with one dark money campaign. Back in 2004, a Super PAC by the name of “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” helped sink John Kerry’s presidential bid with a series of ads attacking the Democratic candidate’s military record.  And those ads were the work of LaCivita.  LaCivita’s attacks on Democratic candidates have, at times, even made his Republican clients uncomfortable. Early in his career, reporters described him as a “Republican hit-man,” using words like “hyperactive,” “manic” and “renegade.” And now, it appears LaCivita is running the old playbook, orchestrating the right-wing attacks on the 24-year military career of Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walls of Minnesota. I've already debunked those attacks. They are gross. So far, outside of the angry right-wing social media hellscape, they aren’t really landing the way the attacks on Kerry did. But there's more: The guy who made those attacks against Kerry possible 20 years ago was a donor named Harlan Crow. Yes, that Harlan Crow: the billionaire who has lavished gifts on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for decades. Crow ultimately gave LaCivita’s “Swift-boat” group tens of thousands of dollars. What’s to stop him from doing that again?  It’s also worth mentioning that LaCivita isn’t just a Trump campaign aide. This year he also became the de facto COO of the Republican National Committee, which gives him control over its campaign spending. It's said everything old is new again ... that includes in politics.

JD Vance is a bad nerd,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-nerd-magic-gathering-rcna165881,"Since former President Donald Trump tapped him to be his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has become the poster child for the Democrats’ new favorite word — “weird” — as his stiff demeanor and atrocious policy beliefs have been placed center stage. It’s in this harsh spotlight another of Vance’s traits has come to the forefront: He’s a big ol’ nerd. There have been pieces written about his devotion to the classic fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings” and the way it’s shaped his worldview. More recently, he and his wife, Usha Vance, gave interviews talking about his time playing “Magic: The Gathering,” a card game that draws heavily on fantasy tropes. I want to underscore that these two descriptors — “weird” and “nerd” — are not synonymous. As a card-carrying nerd myself, I would have to say that Vance’s love of stereotypically geeky interests has nothing to do with his creepy tendencies. If anything, he has shown himself to be the worst kind of nerd, one who reinforces the toxic masculinity that was at one point inseparable from overarching geekdom. It is to Vance’s discredit that he will likely be unable to see how deeply his rejection of all things “woke” isolates him from a community that has come to embrace the “good weird” that doesn’t fit into his homogenized vision of America. Let’s start with Vance’s ties to M:TG (not the GOP congresswoman from Georgia). Earlier this week, an interview with Usha Vance aired on “Fox & Friends,” aimed at helping to soften her husband’s image and defend his now infamous “childless cat ladies” comments. “He has all sorts of dorky interests that anyone of our age could relate to,” she told Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt. Those interests, Earhardt told her co-hosts, include playing the collectable trading card game. Vance denied that it was a current interest when Semafor asked him about it Wednesday, calling it a “phase.” More interesting, though, was the reason he said he ditched the game: He may have meant it as a laugh line, but it speaks to something very real about how gatekeeping has worked in nerd spaces. It’s true that back when Vance would have been playing, as depicted briefly in the movie adaptation of his book “Hillbilly Elegy,” the game was not exactly popular among young women. Even as of 2015, only an estimated 38% of the game’s players were female, according to one of Magic’s designers. But arguably much of that was due to the self-reinforcing habits of male players who would scoff at any girl who could possibly try to compete against them. How many of the 15-year-old girls whom Vance wrote off as having no interest would have been interested in learning how to play alongside him? It’s only relatively recently that the game’s owner, Wizards of the Coast, itself a subsidiary of Hasbro, has realized how much of the population was being excluded from playing (and buying cards) thanks to the perceived gender norms around the game. Since then, it has moved to eliminate the sexist art that was the norm for the cards’ illustrations and tried to make the game feel more inclusive overall. It’s a shift that of course drew some backlash from the JD Vances of the world. Beyond this specific issue, I’d argue that Vance is bad at being a nerd, given how deeply he has clearly missed the point of “The Lord of the Rings.” J.R.R. Tolkien’s seminal work was born in part out of his view of the horrors of World War I. It stresses the need for fellowship among different groups against the forces of evil and a rejection of the desire for ultimate power. As The New York Times’ David French and Jamelle Bouie have separately noted, there’s little evidence that those messages sunk in with Vance. Vance shares that obliviousness with his benefactor, billionaire Peter Thiel, who made his fortune as an early investor in PayPal. After all, Thiel named his giant data analytics company Palantir after the all-seeing orbs that the villains use to spy on the heroes in “The Lord of the Rings.” As a reference, that’s a deep enough cut to really show off one’s geek credentials while displaying exactly zero comprehension about why Thiel’s pursuit of military contracts would be something that the story’s protagonists would frown upon. We can see this determination to miss the values for the merchandise among many branches of nerd culture. Recently, a post on Reddit’s r/Conservative message board detailed how a group of “Star Trek” fans were appalled to hear politics brought up at a Las Vegas convention. It’s truly a mystery as to how these supposed fans missed the very transparent left-wing tilt throughout the “Trek” franchise, which is set in a post-capitalist utopia where diversity is the greatest of strengths. Along with this purposeful blindness comes the lack of recognition from Vance and those like him that the nerds have won. Geek culture has become a pop culture Goliath. The most popular franchises in the world have realized that it matters that everyone gets to see themselves in the stories being told. For Vance and others, it’s not their interests in comic books or sci-fi that sets them apart now. What’s weird is their refusal to share that win with anyone who doesn’t fit the outdated stereotype of who and what a nerd is. Considering who Vance has become, it’s easy to clock the kind of nerd he once was. Over the last eight years, he’s transformed himself from someone who correctly saw Trump as a threat to the country into Trump’s potential vice president. Much like with Magic, he has opted to drop his morals like a bad habit, showing that he’s more than willing to shift and change himself to try to fit in with his chosen in-group. In doing so, he’s shown himself to be the kind of nerd who has chosen to punch down out of fear of being punched himself."
Elon Musk sues his critics into silence. So much for ‘free speech.’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-x-advertisers-lawsuit-social-media-rcna165605,"Elon Musk, self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” is demanding the government infringe on free speech rights. Again. Despite his posturing as a defender of free expression, Musk is one of the nation’s most vexatious litigants against anybody who exercises their First Amendment rights in a way he doesn’t like. His latest target is GARM, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an industry association of advertisers on online platforms of which X, formerly known as Twitter, is still a member. The lawsuit also targets several of GARM’s members for the supposed crime of declining to purchase ads on Musk’s website. X’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, posted a video on Tuesday explaining that the suit is part of the company’s noble pursuit of preserving “the global town square … the one place that you can express yourself freely and openly.” Yaccarino wore a pendant around her neck that read “FREE SPEECH.” On Thursday, GARM, citing its inability to handle legal fees that would likely run into the seven figures, simply shut its doors, ending all operations. Musk’s censorial bullying worked — abusing the legal system to shut down his critics. Musk’s argument against GARM fits a long-running pattern for him: attacks on free speech wrapped in the rhetoric of defending free speech. Major corporations generally do not want to pay for ads running next to posts praising Adolf Hitler, among other noxious content that has flourished on X under Musk’s ownership. It’s hardly an unreasonable position, and GARM worked to promulgate shared standards companies can adopt for this type of brand safety. This, Musk alleges, amounted to a violation of antitrust laws. Deciding where to purchase ads is an exercise of core free speech and free association rights for any individual or organization. Boycotting X because it’s overrun with hate speech is no different from a conservative advocacy group declining to pay for ads on a progressive podcast. It’s also a case of business judgment for for-profit corporations. PetSmart might well choose to buy magazine ads in Cat Fancy rather than Cigar Aficionado, for example. It’s the latest in a long line of Musk lawsuits seeking to silence his critics, a tactic known as a strategic lawsuit against public participation, or SLAPP. He’s also sued Media Matters for documenting how X fails to keep ads from large corporations away from extremist content. In the same vein, he’s gone after the Center for Countering Digital Hate. He also endorsed the patently absurd criminal investigations into Media Matters launched by the Republican attorneys general of Texas and Missouri, already enjoined by a federal court as the obvious First Amendment violations they are. Sometimes Musk’s interest in promoting censorship extends beyond his own critics, such as when he agreed to pay the legal fees of a Canadian anti-vaxxer who had sued a wide range of people for being mean to her. For many years, actual free speech advocates have been pushing for anti-SLAPP laws, which make it easier to promptly dismiss and receive legal fees for litigation targeting constitutionally protected speech. Texas and California among other states have adopted these robust protections. Unfortunately, there is no national anti-SLAPP law for lawsuits based on federal law claims, such as Musk’s antitrust theory. Federal circuit courts are also divided on whether state anti-SLAPP laws can apply even to state law claims, such as defamation, being heard in federal court under interstate diversity jurisdiction. In the meantime, Musk’s anti-speech lawfare has its intended effect even when it could never plausibly reach a final decision in his favor. In addition to shutting down GARM, Media Matters recently laid off several employees, too, with many observers pointing to Musk’s litigation as a likely contributor. This is the defining feature of SLAPP strategy: process as punishment, ruining targets with the expense of fighting a case even when it lacks any legal merit. The tactic can be particularly effective aimed at nonprofits and individuals, whose relatively modest budgets simply cannot handle a protracted court battle with one of the world’s richest men. Beyond simply being a rich and powerful bully who can waste his own money on vexatious, performative litigation, Musk’s theory of “free speech” is a censorship wolf in sheep’s clothing. He and those he agrees with should be free to speak their minds, the thinking goes, but nobody else should be allowed to criticize or disassociate from them in response. If it falls under nebulous labels like “cancel culture” or the “woke mind virus,” your speech is actually bad for speech and so shouldn’t be allowed. It’s unabashedly statist in its eagerness to use and abuse government power to police the discourse. Musk is free to run his own website however he wants, as he should be. But his claims to be a champion of free speech are a hypocritical farce. In reality, he is one of the biggest enemies of the First Amendment, and should be recognized as such."
Joe Rogan broke MAGA world’s heart with his RFK Jr. support,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 4:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-joe-rogan-rfk-jr-maga-rcna166033,"Joe Rogan’s praise of independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. had Trump supporters up in arms on Thursday. Rogan’s far-right-friendly podcast, his peddling of outlandish conspiracy theories, and his alignment with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (an unmistakably pro-Trump organization) appear to have led some Trump supporters to believe Rogan would ultimately throw his support fully behind former President Donald Trump.  But when video surfaced of Rogan gushing over Kennedy and calling him “the only [candidate] that makes sense to me,"" popular voices among the MAGA faithful were quite unhappy.  The petulant kvetching from several prominent figures in the MAGA movement channeled the widespread rage at Rogan for what apparently felt like a betrayal.  Check out some examples of the morose MAGA reactions from far-right influencer Philip Buchanan (also known as Catturd), as well as right-wing conspiracy theorists Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich.  Facing backlash, Rogan sent out a tweet on Friday praising Trump and claiming his remarks about Kennedy being the only candidate that makes sense weren't really an endorsement. That doesn't seem to have satisfied Trump, who targeted Rogan on his social media platform. “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC ring,” Trump posted from his Truth Social account.  Many conservatives were all-in on the idea of Kennedy’s campaign when he was running as a Democrat, because Kennedy's campaign was initially perceived as capable of helping Trump win by peeling off voters from what was then the Biden-Harris campaign. Kennedy, who was reportedly convinced to run for president by Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and whose campaign is largely being funded by uber-rich Trump-supporter Timothy Mellon, was effectively running an ostensibly liberal campaign with MAGA DNA. But ever since Kennedy decided to run as an independent instead — and as data show he’s likely to pull more voters from Trump than from Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election — Republicans, including Donald Trump himself, have turned their ire on Kennedy and any MAGA-friendly figures who might back him."
Trump’s hopes in Arizona could be dimming. Here’s why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-arizona-2024-election-harris-rcna166027,"Momentum appears to be swinging in favor of Kamala Harris’ campaign in the Grand Canyon State. Although I’m not one who places a whole lot of stake in poll numbers, some of the recent numbers in Arizona have been favorable to the Democratic nominee. But there are other signs that Donald Trump’s electoral prospects could be dimming in the desert. One piece of evidence is the budding Republican support for Harris. John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, recently endorsed the Harris campaign and agreed to co-chair an advisory committee for the national “Republicans for Harris” effort. Giles’ endorsement underscores two things in particular. First, it speaks to Arizona’s trend toward Democrats over the past decade. For instance, Mesa has gone from one of the most conservative cities in the country to one with more liberal leanings. And the endorsement also shows that a strain of anti-Trump conservatism remains in Arizona, where Trump’s attacks on the late Sen. John McCain have undermined his standing with some Republicans in the state. Senate candidate Kari Lake, another high-profile Republican on the Arizona ballot this fall, has garnered intraparty backlash herself for her attacks on McCain and fellow Republicans. Many in Lake’s own party are backing her Democratic opponent, Ruben Gallego. In fact, she might even be a drag on Trump’s election chances. And on top of that, on Friday, the Harris campaign received a historic endorsement from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy group for Latinos. That could prove very helpful in Arizona, where Latinos make up about a third of the population. Recent data on Latino voters indicates that Harris is attracting and energizing these voters in Arizona — where Latinos were vital in helping Joe Biden flip the state in 2020 — and other battleground states. Trump’s campaign and its surrogates have sought to make gains with Latino voters — albeit in some rather dubious ways. But if Harris is able to maintain the Latino support Biden received in 2020, or even expand it, that could prove calamitous for Trump’s electoral hopes in Arizona. Beyond that, Arizona residents will be voting on a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. With voters in other states siding with abortion-rights supporters on similar measures in recent years, this could create yet another hurdle for Trump in Arizona. None of this means Trump can’t win the Grand Canyon State. But he certainly hasn’t made it easy on himself."

And since Thursday, the internet transvestigators have honed in on  two boxers who — again — are not trans.  After Italy’s Angela Carini quit 46 seconds into her fight against Algeria’s Imane Khelif, conservative politicians, including former President Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, and other anti-trans voices such as author JK Rowling and YouTuber Logan Paul took to social media Thursday to accuse Khelif of being a man. The rumor mill over Khelif ran wild, ranging from people claiming she was a trans woman, to others who claimed she’s just a cis man who hasn’t even transitioned and just wants to cheat. Similar accusations were levied against Khelif’s fellow boxer Lin Yu‑ting of Taiwan. The true story is, of course, much more complex than can be explained clearly in a handful of rage tweets. Both Khelif and Lin were born as women. They have always identified as women. And for years they competed in women’s boxing, including at multiple world championships and the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics. Both have posted numerous losses to cis women in their careers.  The anti-trans fury stems from last year’s world championships, when the International Boxing Association disqualified both boxers for failing “to meet eligibility rules.” IBA president Umar Kremlev claimed at the time that Khelif and Lin were “proven they have XY chromosomes.” But the circumstances around that claim are hugely suspicious. The IBA, the Russian-led organization that suspended her, has actually itself been suspended by the International Olympic Committee over rampant governance problems and corruption issues. Kremlev, who is Russian, made his comments to a Russian news outlet after Khelif defeated a Russian boxer. IBA officials never released details of the method or results of the gender tests. Following the World Championships, Taiwan’s sports administration conducted their own tests and confirmed Lin’s eligibility for international competition. “We have no knowledge of what the tests were,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams told The Washington Post. “They were cobbled together, as I understand, overnight [during the world championships] to change the results.” Yet a lone, unverified claim, along with the boxers’ short hair, has led to masses of online anti-trans activists hurling abuse at two women simply for pursuing their Olympic dreams. Even some journalists like the Guardian’s Sean Ingle have called attention to the Italian boxer’s suffering and demanded explanations from the IOC. But according to The Associated Press, Carini “said she wasn’t making a political statement and was not refusing to fight Khelif.” This whole “controversy” shows how far the anti-trans movement will push in its pursuit to stamp out gender nonconformity from society. It already pushed trans women out of sports. Now it is going after anyone with a strong jaw or a muscular physique. What’s next? Are women with elevated testosterone levels (which can arise from diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome) going to be declared men? Where does it end? It’s truly a shame that so many people have attacked Khelif’s gender when her true story is one of inspiration. As a kid, she wanted to learn how to box, but her father forbade it, telling her that the sport was “not for girls.” Now she is competing at the Olympics. Yet even self-proclaimed feminists like Rowling want to ban her from boxing like Khelif’s father once did. Every day, it seems, anti-trans voices narrow who counts as a “real woman” in sports, in bathrooms and in life. Their fury and gender obsession come at the expense of women and girls who suddenly find themselves excluded from an increasingly restricted definition of womanhood. How much further must we bend to these ideologues? They succeeded in killing the Olympic dream for trans children everywhere. Now they want to push out women who do not meet their arbitrary standard of womanhood. Society has no need for gender police. It’s time we say, “no more.”"
"Why pro-Palestinian protesters are going after Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 2:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-gaza-israel-protests-obama-dreamers-rcna166006,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight,” guest hosted by Ali Velshi. The last time Democrats sought to hold onto the White House after four years in power was in 2012, when then-President Barack Obama was running against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Romney was not the most conservative candidate in the Republican Party, even back then. But he had staked out an aggressive hard-right position on the issue of immigration, running on a platform of “self-deportation” — making life so hard for immigrants in this country that they have no choice but to leave. Given that, it probably surprised a lot of people that young undocumented immigrants had chosen to spend their time and energy protesting … President Obama. They held mass demonstrations outside the White House where many were arrested. They showed up at his campaign offices in California, carrying signs that read, “Obama stop deporting Dreamers.” Protesters even held a hunger strike sit-in at Obama’s campaign offices in the then-swing state of Colorado. At issue were protections for Dreamers, people who were brought to this country without legal authorization as children, many of whom had lived in the U.S. almost their entire lives. Obama supported protections for those Dreamers, but he insisted that he could not grant them those protections alone. He said the Republican-controlled Congress would have to send him a bill. But then, in June of 2012, right in the middle of the campaign, something remarkable happened: Obama came around and decided to try. He announced that he would grant protection to thousands of Dreamers through executive order.  The pressure worked and Obama was re-elected with strong support from the Latino community, despite the protests. However, much to the chagrin of the Obama administration, the protests didn’t stop. Many of those Dreamers were now protected, but there were still some who weren’t. And the parents of those Dreamers could still be deported at any moment. So those activists kept pushing, even interrupting the president during speaking events. Obama, again, insisted that he did not have the power to take those actions alone. But activists kept the pressure on. The following year, Obama moved again, using another executive order to shield even more Dreamers from deportation and deprioritize the deportation of people without criminal records. There were plenty of people at the time who questioned the strategy of those protesters, who asked why they weren’t protesting Romney and the Republicans in Congress who were blocking progress on immigration reform; but those protesters understood a key part of how social movements work. They understood that sometimes in order to make real change you have to target the people who are moveable, the people who want you in their coalition, the people who actually care. That is both the burden and the beauty of what it means to be part of a functioning, big-tent political party that's responsive to social change — to be on the side of what the late Rep. John Lewis called “good trouble.” On Wednesday, at a rally in Detroit, Vice President Kamala Harris was interrupted by a group of demonstrators protesting the war in Gaza. After their second interruption, Harris shut down the protesters, telling them, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” That’s a snappy line that makes for a good soundbite and it’s undeniably true that she will be a better president for their cause than Donald Trump. But, as those immigration protesters proved back in the Obama administration, these issues are more complicated than “we’re better for you than the other guys.” Harris has already proven she is the kind of thoughtful leader who listens and that she understands the nuance of this particular issue, even while some continue to insist that neither nuance nor context matters on this story. Her campaign presents a real opportunity to reset the relationship with the varied communities expressing dissatisfaction over this war, and America’s role in it. But will the Harris campaign use this as an opportunity to listen? And can those protesters use this as an opportunity to be heard?

Mike Lindell company must pay attorney fees in 'Prove Mike Wrong' case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 1:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/lindell-mypillow-attorney-fees-prove-mike-wrong-rcna166007,"In the latest legal development for conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell, his company was ordered to pay attorney’s fees in the fallout from litigation over his challenge to disprove his 2020 election fraud claim. Back in February, a federal judge approved a $5 million award against Lindell’s company in the so-called Prove Mike Wrong challenge. Lindell Management LLC had hosted a cyber symposium in which a participant could win $5 million if they proved that certain data Lindell had wasn’t valid election data. Robert Zeidman effectively succeeded in that task, and a federal judge ordered the award to be paid. Lindell Management has filed an appeal seeking to vacate the award. Meanwhile, a federal magistrate judge on Thursday ordered the company to pay another, much smaller amount. The latest litigation concerned Zeidman’s request for attorney’s fees connected with bringing a motion to compel responses during discovery. Zeidman sought $12,800, but the court found he was entitled to $4,508, with the judge applying a lower hourly rate than Zeidman requested and noting that his discovery requests were overbroad and contributed to the costs he incurred. Though it pales in comparison to the millions Lindell’s company was ordered to pay in the challenge loss, the MyPillow CEO may nonetheless appreciate the judge’s scrutiny of the fee award, especially if he loses his appeal.

MAGA influencers say Trump is on track to lose the election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 1:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-election-laura-loomer-nick-fuentes-maga-rcna166003,"Concerned about Donald Trump’s prospects of winning the presidential election, some right-wing influencers are lashing out over what they feel has been a weak campaign. Laura Loomer, a bigoted conspiracy theorist and social media troll whom Trump has praised repeatedly, sounded the alarm on X on Thursday. “President Trump needs to make some serious changes in his campaign ASAP,” she wrote in part. “The ground game is not sufficient. “The offense is lacking. “The communication is dismal. “The momentum is crashing. “Why are people who want to assist being pushed away instead of being embraced?” I don’t know precisely what Loomer means about people who want to assist being pushed away, though her outlandish behavior has, at times, made her a tad too toxic for some Trump supporters to associate with. Lately, however, Trump has had no problem sharing her bigoted, baseless attacks concerning Kamala Harris’ biracial identity, as he and other conservatives have falsely questioned the vice president’s Blackness. In the replies and quote tweets on Loomer’s post about Trump’s ground game, there was some pushback. But a number of popular MAGA enthusiasts were in agreement with her. That includes white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who wrote on X that his former dinner mate’s campaign is in a “death spiral” and listed his grievances. In the comments replying to his post, Fuentes faced a deluge of angry backlash. More criticism came from popular conservative pundit John Cardillo, who claimed on X that far-right activist group Turning Point USA and other pro-Trump groups are out of their depth. “Guys, we do not have a ground game,” he wrote in part. “Outsourcing that most critical function to TPUSA Action and two other untested PACs are not the actions of a campaign serious about winning. “Frankly, it’s insane.” Predictably, Cardillo faced blowback from TPUSA members and affiliates, who insisted that their efforts to help Trump have been moving swimmingly along. We’ll know in just a few months. But for the time being, there’s clearly discontent and division in MAGA world, with many Trump supporters worried about a campaign they think is primed to lose."
Why isn’t Donald Trump spending more time on the campaign trail?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 12:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/isnt-donald-trump-spending-time-campaign-trail-rcna166022,"While his criminal trial unfolded in May, Donald Trump routinely complained that the legal proceedings represented “election interference.” To back up his rhetoric, the former president had a habit of telling reporters, “I’d like to be campaigning.” As the argument went, the Republican candidate wanted to be on the campaign trail — holding rallies, meeting voters, attending fundraisers, doing photo-ops, etc. — and the fact that he was stuck in a criminal courtroom a few days per week was interfering with his electoral opportunities. There were, however, a couple of glaring problems with the claim. For one thing, criminal proceedings aren’t simply put on indefinite hold when a defendant seeks elected office. For another, there were plenty of off-days in the trial, when Trump could’ve held campaign events. He didn’t bother. Three months later, the trial has run its course — a jury found the Republican guilty of 34 felonies — and the GOP nominee still isn’t maintaining much of a campaign schedule. CNBC reported: In August 2016, the then-candidate held 27 campaign rallies across 15 states. As August 2024 gets underway, Trump has held one event so far, and over the last six weeks, he’s only held eight. The Washington Post ran a related analysis, further documenting just how much the Republican candidate has slowed his schedule down this year. Asked at his meandering press conference about his light schedule, the former president called it a “stupid question,” before adding that he doesn’t believe he has to campaign to win. “I’m leading by a lot,” Trump said. The problem, of course, is that the line of inquiry wasn’t stupid — and he isn’t leading by a lot. The result is a good question for which there is no obvious answer: Why isn’t Trump campaigning more? Perhaps he has no idea how competitive the 2024 race has become. Maybe he’s become lazier. Perhaps he’s come to believe holding campaign events doesn’t help much. Maybe there’s an undisclosed health issue. It’s impossible to say for sure from a distance. Whatever the explanation, Trump’s next campaign event is in Montana — which is nowhere near a battleground state — not because he’s trying to give his campaign a boost, but because of a personal vendetta against a Democratic senator who bothered him six years ago. It’s quite a strategy."
Tim Walz deserves better than Team Trump's 'stolen valor' smears,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 12:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-military-record-vance-trump-stolen-valor-rcna165978,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of the finest people I’ve known in politics. He’s a leader of integrity, honor, humility and fight. He’s also a veteran who cares deeply about the well-being of his fellow veterans. Which is why it’s enraging and sad to watch Ohio senator and fellow veteran JD Vance and Team Trump attempt to smear his military record and accuse him of “stolen valor.” “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him — a fact that he’s been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,” Vance, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday. The truth is that Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and retired honorably before his run for Congress in 2005. As an artilleryman, Walz “served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and was the highest-ranking enlisted National Guard Soldier in southern Minnesota when he retired from 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery in 2005,” according to the U.S. Army. Building on this experience, Walz has dedicated his political career to helping other veterans. As the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, veterans had no finer and more tenacious advocate than Walz. Every veteran service organization and veteran leader knows he is one of our own, and that we could always count on him. He knows how to get things done in Washington and for his communities. And he always has our back, from the new GI Bill expansion way back in 2008 to the Clay Hunt SAV Act in 2016 to countless fights in between.  The Democrats had to pick a veteran. And they picked one whom everyone knows, respects and trusts. (And one Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other key party leaders know, respect and trust.) Walz is a patriotic, down to earth and lovable bulldog.  If the Democrats weren’t going to pick a Republican or true independent — or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly — I believe Walz is their best chance to win. Pew research from 2022 showed “about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners (66%) say they like political leaders who have military experience,” with men generally more likely to regard military service as a positive.  Walz still embodies the spirit of his high school football coaching career. He knows how to spot talent, support teammates, make people better, rally diverse groups and encourage a team to victory. And he’s a fighter. Especially in hard times.  The loss of his brother Craig in 2016 was an unthinkable tragedy. But Walz rallied his family through it — like he can rally our country through all this pain and uncertainty now. He understands suffering, he understands working people, he understands national security, he understands America.  And he understands how to punch back. He’s also more liberal than me (and plenty of other Americans), and that will surely challenge him with independents and moderates. And with Walz and Harris together, the Democrats are going to have to fight incredibly hard to show they’re more moderate than the narrative suggests.  Republicans are already weaponizing the fact that Walz was Sen. Bernie Sanders’ preferred pick.  And now, they’re pulling one of their oldest, nastiest and most effective plays out of the playbook, by attacking Walz’s service.  The Harris-Walz campaign was clearly not ready for the Swift boat attacks — but they were entirely predictable. Details, military records and validators who know Walz and the truth should have been buttoned up in advance, ready at the announcement, and shared with the public and media. Unfortunately, they were not.  This is an unnecessary communications and strategy failure, and a reflection of a deeper lack of military and veterans cultural competency in the Democratic Party. This problem also exists in the GOP (to a lesser degree) and indeed all across our society. And it is an important reminder that we need more veterans across the political, media, education and business ecosystem. But the lack of representation — and resulting ignorance — is especially painful in politics. Just ask former Sens. Jim Webb (Virginia) or Bob Kerrey (Nebraska).  The Trump campaign hired Chris LaCivita — a longtime political operative who led the “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” back in 2004 and helped sink Vietnam veteran John Kerry’s campaign — months ago. There’s no reason why Democrats should have been caught flat-footed this time around. Indeed, whether the Swift boat attacks are fair or not, the Harris-Walz campaign should have been more prepared for battle. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Now the campaign (and Walz himself), need to get a plan together, be transparent, clear and forceful, and make up the ground lost. And, where they can, counterattack smartly. This is the first battle of its kind for this new Democratic ticket. But it definitely won’t be the last. Every vote and foot of political ground taken is critical to victory. Especially with veterans — and especially with independent veterans in swing states.  I’d like to live in an America where nobody attacks a veteran's service or tries to compare one term of service to another. Every person who volunteers to wear the uniform has done something for our country that 99% of the public has not. And that should be respected — whether they’re a Navy SEAL hunting Osama Bin Laden or a cook making breakfast for other troops stateside at Fort Liberty. Service to our country is honorable. And one of the most dangerous jobs in America, whether you’re combat deployed or training back home.  But we live in this America. And no matter what anyone says, Tim Walz is incredibly sincere, hard-working, tough and likable. He’s a leader of integrity and character. He’s the opposite of ""weird."" And, yes, he’s funny.  He will change some hearts and minds. Hopefully, enough to beat Trump.  I’m just one veteran. But I’m rooting for him."
"On abortion rights, Trump keeps creating opportunities for Dems",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 12:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/abortion-rights-trump-keeps-creating-opportunities-dems-rcna166008,"In the spring, Donald Trump raised a few eyebrows by confirming — out loud, on camera, and on the record — that he was “looking at” possible restrictions on contraception. The former president eventually walked that back, but not before he created an opportunity that Democrats are already exploiting. In the summer, he’s doing it again. At his long, meandering press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump began by assuring the public that voters don’t much care about reproductive rights — a line Republicans have clung to in recent years, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary — before lying about the Democratic agenda in deeply ugly ways. All of which set the stage for the pièce de resistance. NBC News reported: The GOP nominee went on to argue that there are “many things on a humane basis that you can do outside of that.” The audio in the clip isn’t great, but NBC News’ Garrett Haake posted a written transcript of the exchange online, which reinforces the fact that Trump didn’t appear to have any idea what he was talking about. In fact, all things considered, it’s reasonable to wonder whether the former president has any idea what mifepristone is. For those unfamiliar with the medication — a group that apparently includes the Republican nominee — the FDA approved it nearly a quarter of a century ago, to be used as part of a two-step process to terminate unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks. The drug has proven to be safe, effective, and commonly used. A notorious Trump-appointed judge in Texas curtailed access to the drug, though he was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Nevertheless, many on the right still harbor hopes that the Republican, in a second term, might enforce the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of drugs used for abortions by mail. Indeed, all of this is part of the right-wing Project 2025 agenda, written in large part by members of Team Trump. It was against this backdrop that the GOP candidate left the door wide open to revoking access to the medication during the Q&A at Mar-a-Lago. Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez wasted little time in seizing on the comments from the press conference. “Already, women across the country are suffering because of the nightmare Donald Trump unleashed by overturning Roe v. Wade,” she said. “That reality — women forced to the brink of death before receiving the care they need, doctors facing the threat of jail time for doing their jobs, and survivors of rape and incest made to flee their states for basic health care — will only get worse if Donald Trump wins and wipes out access to medication abortion.”"
Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat appeals weight disqualification ahead of gold medal match,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 11:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/vinesh-phogat-appeal-disqualified-weight-olympics-rcna165964,"Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat just barely failed to make weight ahead of what was set to be her Olympic finals match on Wednesday against American wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt. Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Phogat beat in the semifinal the day before, took Phogat’s place in the 50-kilogram final, and Hildebrandt won the gold — the second for U.S. women wrestlers in as many days. While it was a great feat for Hildebrandt and the U.S. team, it was devastating for Phogat and her many supporters. As NBC News reported, she’s known for her “impassioned activism against sexual harassment in her sport, including making major allegations against the former president of the Wrestling Federation of India.” Phogat then announced her retirement, writing on social media (in a translation from Hindi by Reuters) that her “dreams are shattered. I don’t have any more strength.” Now, you might be wondering: Why are you reading this dramatic wrestling story on a legal blog? That’s because the story might not be over: It’s now a legal one of sorts. Phogat has pleaded her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an institution headquartered in Switzerland with an ad hoc division set up in Paris for the games. On Friday, the court noted that Phogat had filed an application with the tribunal, challenging United World Wrestling’s decision to replace her in the gold medal match. She wants to be awarded a (shared) silver medal.  There are separate weigh-ins for each day of wrestling, so Phogat had made the weight cut-off in her matches leading up to the finals. She reportedly only missed the weight on Wednesday by 100 grams — about a fifth of a pound. Sports Illustrated reported that “she was not only disqualified from the match against Hildebrandt but also had her previous victories in the tournament nullified.” Phogat’s path to success in her challenge is unclear because the UWW's wrestling rules state: “If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of [sic] the competition and ranked last, without rank.” The sports court said the matter has been referred to an arbitrator to hold a hearing with the parties on Friday, with a decision expected before the end of the Olympic Games on Sunday.

Jack Smith seeks more time for planning after immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 8:25 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 9, 2024, 10:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-trump-delay-chutkan-immunity-rcna165928,"UPDATE (Aug. 9, 2024, 1:18 p.m. ET): On Friday, Judge Tanya Chutkan granted special counsel Jack Smith's request for a time extension to file a joint status report in Donald Trump's federal election interference case. The report is now due Aug. 30 and a status conference is set for Sept. 5, Chutkan said. A hallmark of Donald Trump’s litigation strategy has been delay. Now special counsel Jack Smith wants more time in the federal election interference case, though not for the purpose of dragging it out. In a joint filing on Thursday from Smith and Trump’s lawyers, the special counsel told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that prosecutors are still assessing the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling in Trump v. United States, including by consulting with other components of the Justice Department. “Although those consultations are well underway, the Government has not finalized its position on the most appropriate schedule for the parties to brief issues related to the decision,” according to the filing, called a “joint status report.” Smith asked Chutkan for “additional time to provide the Court with an informed proposal regarding the schedule for pretrial proceedings moving forward.” Chutkan had asked the parties for the proposal to determine how to proceed after the case returned to her following the Supreme Court's July 1 immunity ruling. She had also set a status conference for Aug. 16. In Thursday’s filing, Smith asked Chutkan for an extension to submit another joint report by Aug. 30, and to hold the previously scheduled Aug. 16 conference at some point after that. Unsurprisingly, the filing noted that Trump “does not object to the Government’s request for an extension.” So, what’s going on here? It’s not fully clear from the filing, which (unsurprisingly) didn’t detail the DOJ’s deliberations or the extent to which there is disagreement within the department over how to move forward. To be sure, the Supreme Court’s new test for determining what may be immune from prosecution is cryptic enough that it could prompt different interpretations and prosecutorial strategies. The forthcoming filing on the government’s position may provide more insight into the matter. At any rate, pushing the proposal back a few weeks won’t make the difference in whether a trial happens before the election. The timing and substance of the Supreme Court ruling has already made that impracticable. The real question now isn’t whether a trial happens before the presidential election but, in the near term, whether Trump wins that election, in which case he can crush the prosecution himself. If he loses, then the question is what will be left of the case after the high court ruling that at least narrows the prosecution. That’s not an excuse for the government being unprepared with its position about how to proceed, but it’s a reality hovering over the case no matter what Smith’s eventual position is. The bottom line for now is that, since there won’t be a pre-election trial, it’s difficult to see this development as a meaningful delay in the grand scheme of things. That delay has already occurred. The next move is up to Chutkan to decide whether to accept the request. If she does, then there won’t be significant movement in the case before September. As it happens, that’s when Judge Juan Merchan is expected to rule on the immunity decision’s effect on Trump’s guilty verdicts in New York and to sentence him that month if he finds that the immunity ruling doesn’t stand in the way. So the next big filing in Trump’s cases could be Smith’s brief due later this month to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the dismissal of Trump’s federal classified documents case, whose fate, like the federal election interference case, is also partly tied to the presidential election outcome.

Donald Trump and JD Vance are failing America's favorite political test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 10:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-vance-harris-walz-beer-question-rcna165834,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""The Reid Out."" Let’s talk about joy — no not me, Joy, but the feeling of joy. More specifically, the joy being felt by Americans backing the Harris-Walz ticket. A joy that is palpable and pervasive.  We saw that joy on full display, with massive crowds greeting Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at their rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday. It feels like we are experiencing another 2008 Obama moment. The energy, the excitement, the enthusiasm. It feels fun. Imagine that, American politics … joyful again. The 2024 presidential election has quickly become the tale of two tickets: one radiates joy and the other is dour and frankly, frightening. And it’s clear that has Republicans freaking out. Harris has not only been criticized for her race, gender and parental status — but also for laughing. As if an infectious, energizing belly laugh — the literal display of joy — is a bad thing. Walz is also a joyful guy. His former students love him. He was a popular and successful high school football coach. He made “weird” happen. He’s a Midwesterner with “big dad energy” who will offer tips on how to fix your car and save money to boot. Some of you may be familiar with the “beer question” in U.S. politics: a thought experiment often utilized by the media or in polling, which says voters will generally elect the candidate they would rather have a beer with. Victory in American politics often goes not to the candidate who better articulates their platform, but rather, to whoever is more likable. So you be the judge: Who would you rather have a beer with? Harris, who dares to laugh and Walz, the plain-spoken fun uncle who will defend the people he loves? Or Trump, who rambles about sharks and hatred, who makes fun of people and smirks but who rarely laughs, and who doesn’t seem capable of talking to a child — even his own grandkids? And his cat lady-hating sidekick Sen. JD Vance? That guy is really weird. So weird the couch meme won’t die. Vance is basically stalking the Democratic ticket. On Wednesday, he stunned reporters by attempting to confront Harris and Walz on the tarmac when their planes arrived in Wisconsin at similar times.  Vance told reporters he “just wanted to check out [his] future plane.” Walking up to the vice president and Air Force Two is not a thing that normal people do. His weirdness aside, this race has also been a total reversal of how the parties are normally framed. The Republicans love to attack Democratic elites — but this time around, Harris and Walz actually feel like the more regular, normal middle-class folks. Yes, they are living extraordinary political lives but due to hard work, not connections or riches.  Harris went to Howard University, an HBCU, then The University Of California, Hastings College Of Law. Walz attended an open-admissions teachers college in northwest Nebraska. Quite the opposite of the candidates on the Republican side — with Trump-Vance being the Ivy League ticket, loved by the billionaires. It’s a conundrum for the Republican Party. The so-called populist MAGA movement is now bankrolling a celebrity who inherited his wealth, who is not out there campaigning but instead golfing at this exclusive ritzy resort, and a vice presidential candidate anointed by another super weird guy, tech investor Peter Thiel. It’s also a ticket backed by billionaire tech bros who want to unleash Project 2025 — the brainchild of rich people — on the American people.  It is a hateful vision that all people should fear … and it’s a vision reflected perfectly by the two men who want to execute it.

"On Harris’ racial identity, Trump apparently can’t help himself",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 9:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-racial-identity-trump-apparently-cant-help-rcna165982,"Donald Trump spent much of last week taking aim at Kamala Harris’ racial identity — up to and including the Republican promoting messages related to the Democrat’s birth certificate. The tactics were as racist as they were familiar: Axios described the effort as “Trump’s new birtherism.” Earlier this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who became a sycophantic ally, appeared on Fox News and suggested the party steer clear of comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage ... is a good day for her and a bad day for us,” the South Carolina Republican said. Putting aside the fact that it’s a bad sign when a senator has to publicly appeal to his party’s presidential nominee to be less racist, Graham’s advice appeared sensible. Even Trump’s allies struggled to explain why, exactly, the GOP nominee was investing so much energy into targeting Harris on racial grounds. The former president nevertheless ignored Graham’s recommendation. The New Republic highlighted one of the more memorable exchanges from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago news conference: When a reporter, referencing one of Trump’s comments from last week, specifically asked the former president how it is that Harris only recently decided to be Black, the GOP nominee replied, “You’ll have to ask her that question because she’s the one that said it. I didn’t say it.” As part of the same exchange, Trump went on to argue: “From her standpoint, I think it’s very disrespectful to both, really. Whether it’s Indian or Black, I think it’s very disrespectful to both.” So, a few things. First, the idea that he “didn’t say” that Harris recently decided to be Black is the opposite of the truth. Appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention last week, Trump said — out loud, on the record and on camera — “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Is she Indian, or is she Black?” Second, the idea that a biracial person is being “disrespectful” by honoring their mother’s and father’s heritage is every bit as offensive as it seems. Finally, spare a thought for the Trump sycophants who’ve tried and failed to defend the former president’s fixation on Harris’ race — Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, I’m looking in your direction — only to have the GOP nominee casually stroll back into the racist trap of his own making."
"Friday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.9.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fridays-campaign-8924-rcna165973,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * At his Mar-a-Lago news conference, Donald Trump insisted that his MAGA base represents “75% of the country.” In reality, the Republican didn’t quite reach 47% of the popular vote in 2020, and while in office, he spent four years struggling to get his approval rating up to 50%. * Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign is launching a seven-figure ad blitz targeting Latino voters in battleground states. NBC News reported that the ads, highlighting Harris as the daughter of an immigrant mother, will air in English and Spanish. * On a related note, since its founding in 1929, the League of United Latin American Citizens has never before endorsed a presidential candidate. LULAC has nevertheless thrown its backing behind the Harris ticket. * The Harris-Walz campaign has also released a new ad, titled “Knows,” emphasizing the Democratic candidate’s working-class background, and a spot titled “Tougher” on her border-security work. * In Arizona, the latest HighGround Public Affairs survey found Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego with an 11-point lead over Republican conspiracy theorist Kari Lake in their U.S. Senate race. The same poll also showed Harris narrowly leading Trump in the Grand Canyon State. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * Speaking of battleground state polling, the latest statewide survey in Georgia, conducted by the AARP, found Harris and Trump tied, with each garnering 48% support. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * NBC News reports that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s independent expenditure arm is launching its first attack in the Montana Senate race, targeting Republican Tim Sheehy over public lands. * And speaking of Montana, Trump is headed to Big Sky Country for a campaign event — instead of a more traditional and competitive battleground state — in part because of a personal vendetta the former president is waging against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. It’s worth emphasizing for context, however, that Trump also waged a personal vendetta against the Montana farmer six years ago, and Tester narrowly won re-election anyway."
"In the debate over the debates, Trump blinks under pressure",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 8:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/debate-debates-trump-blinks-pressure-rcna165960,"As recently as a week ago, Donald Trump and his team had made a categorical decision: The Republican would not participate in a Sept. 10 presidential debate to be hosted on ABC. Team Trump had originally agreed to participate in the event, but as of seven days ago, the GOP nominee and his political operation had changed their minds. In fact, they presented a relatively detailed case explaining their decision to back away from the original commitment, citing Trump’s ongoing litigation against ABC and network anchor George Stephanopoulos, which dovetailed with the former president’s incessant whining — online and in conservative media interviews — about the network. Trump instead said he would only agree to debate on Fox News — at a time of his choosing, in a location of his choosing, and with the kind of in-venue audience that makes him happy. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping when President Joe Biden was still running, the Republican posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” And then he blinked. The Associated Press reported: In other words, over the course of a few months, Team Trump agreed to the ABC debate, then backed out of the ABC debate, then caved under pressure and re-agreed to the ABC debate. In the process, the former president also expressed interest in two other debates — not including a possible event for the vice presidential candidates — though during his news conference he flubbed the dates while pointing to debates that haven’t yet been negotiated and might not occur. As for why, exactly, Trump spent weeks backing away from sharing a stage with Harris, only to have a sudden change of heart, I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s thinking, but it’s hard not to notice the parallels between the GOP nominee’s thinking this week and Biden’s thinking months ago: The incumbent wanted to shake up the 2024 race, so he agreed to debate his rival. Months later, it’s Trump who suddenly feels the need to shake up the campaign, so he agreed to reverse course on debating his rival. The Republican declared at his Mar-a-Lago news conference, “I haven’t recalibrated strategy at all.” His debate strategy suggests otherwise."
Trump doesn’t recall Jan. 6 and the transition of power as well as he should,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-doesnt-recall-jan-6-transition-power-well-rcna165950,"No human being should care as much about crowd sizes as Donald Trump, who has spent years obsessing over how many people show up to hear him talk. Lately, however, it’s been worse — not just because of the former president’s narcissism, but also because some impressive audiences have started showing up to Kamala Harris’ rallies. It’s apparently driving the Republican nominee a little batty. At his long, rambling Mar-a-Lago news conference, for example, after a reporter brought up the Democrat’s crowds, a visibly displeased Trump said his crowds are up to “30 times” larger than Harris’. The arithmetic reinforced just how unintentionally amusing the misplaced boast was: The public is apparently supposed to believe that if 10,000 people show up for a Harris event, it might seem impressive, but not when compared with the 300,000 imaginary people who’ve shown up for a Trump event. Of particular interest to the GOP candidate, however, was the crowd on hand to hear his Jan. 6 lies ahead of the assault on the U.S. Capitol. After going on and on for a while about how impressed he was with his Jan. 6 audience — he has insisted repeatedly in recent years that the crowd size that day is what really matters — Trump apparently thought it’d be a good idea to draw a comparison to a major historical event. “If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours — same real estate, same everything — same number of people. If not, we had more,” the former president said at his news conference. “And they said he had a million people but I had 25,000 people.” He chuckled. “But when you look at the exact same picture and everything’s the same because it was — the fountains, the whole thing all the way back to, from Lincoln to Washington, and you look at it and you look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd — we actually had more people.” None of this was even remotely true. Trump apparently didn’t care. What’s more, as part of the same set of remarks, the former president added: “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6.” That wasn’t true, either. But perhaps the most striking lie was Trump’s comments on the transfer of power. The Associated Press reported: It’d be great if that were true. It wasn’t. Not only did an insurrectionist mob, fueled by Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, attack the Capitol two weeks before Inauguration Day, but as the defeated Republican grudgingly exited the White House — refusing to attend his successor’s swearing-in — military personnel and police officers patrolled the streets of Washington, fearing additional potential violence from Trump’s followers. I’m reminded of remarks former Rep. Liz Cheney delivered in June 2022, as the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee began its public hearings, and the Wyoming Republican made an appeal to the public. “Remember the men and women who have fought and died so that we can live under the rule of law, not the rule of men,” Cheney said. “I ask you to think of the scene in our Capitol rotunda on the night of Jan. 6. There, in, a sacred space in our constitutional republic, the place where our presidents lie in state, watched over by statues of Washington and Jefferson, Lincoln and Grant, Eisenhower, Ford and Reagan, against every wall that night encircling the room, there were SWAT teams, men and women in tactical gear with long guns deployed inside our Capitol building. “There in the rotunda, these brave men and women rested beneath paintings depicting the earliest scenes of our Republic, including one painted in 1824 depicting George Washington resigning his commission, voluntarily relinquishing power, handing control of the Continental Army back to Congress. With this noble act, Washington set the indispensable example of the peaceful transfer of power. What President Reagan called, ‘nothing less than a miracle.’ The sacred obligation to defend this peaceful transfer of power has been honored by every American president — except one.”"
"On Biden’s retirement, Trump flubs meaning of ‘unconstitutional’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 6:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joe-biden-retirement-trump-flubs-unconstitutional-election-2024-rcna165935,"The first sign of trouble came last week. Donald Trump, complaining about President Joe Biden’s retirement, argued by way of his social media platform that Democrats were “Unconstitutionally” nominating someone new for the party’s 2024 ballot. On Tuesday, the Republican repeated the line, arguing that Democratic Party leaders “Unconstitutionally” took the incumbent’s candidacy away from him. (Why Trump capitalizes the word unnecessarily is unclear, though he’s long adopted his own idiosyncratic approach to grammatical rules.) At his long, rambling Mar-a-Lago press conference, the GOP nominee returned to the subject, suggesting that Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 nomination is, you guessed it, “unconstitutional.” After claiming that Harris was secretly in league with a Democratic cabal that pushed Biden to end his candidacy — an assertion he made up out of whole cloth — Trump said: It’s difficult to say from a distance whether Trump was genuinely confused about recent events or was simply hoping to deceive the public, but he was combining events from two different election cycles. His argument, in effect, was that Harris shouldn’t be the Democratic nominee in 2024 because her 2020 candidacy fell far short, which is every bit as absurd as it seems. But it was his use of the word “unconstitutional” that stood out. Whether the former president realizes this or not, the U.S. Constitution is silent on the matter of party nomination processes. Biden was free to retire voluntarily; he was free to endorse his vice president as his successor; Harris was free to seek her party’s nomination; and Democrats were free to choose her to lead the party’s ticket. Not only were these events in line with federal election law, the idea that the U.S. Constitution somehow prohibits the developments is ridiculous. Trump was nevertheless proud of the comments and promoted a video of his comments on his online platform. Or put another way, instead of being embarrassed by talking about constitutional law in an incoherent way, the Republican seemed eager to flaunt his ignorance. Making matters worse, there’s a larger pattern to consider. In 2019, Trump didn’t like the U.S. House’s impeachment process, so he labeled it “unconstitutional.” In 2023, Trump condemned automatic voter registration, so he labeled it “unconstitutional,” too. Around the same time, the former president said court-imposed gag orders on criminal suspects were “unconstitutional,” and the FBI executing a court-approved search warrant at his glorified country club was “unconstitutional,” too. What voters are confronting, in other words, is a politician who appears to have convinced himself that “unconstitutional” and “stuff that bothers me” are synonymous. They’re not."
"On targeting Hillary Clinton, Trump isn’t done rewriting history",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-hillary-clinton-trump-isnt-done-rewriting-history-rcna165924,"The list of lies Donald Trump told during his long and meandering Mar-a-Lago press conference isn’t short, but NBC News highlighted one of the most striking: the former president’s rhetoric about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As part of the same remarks, the Republican nominee said Clinton — who, as a former senator and Cabinet secretary, was more than simply the wife of a former president — was “pretty evil,” but in Trump’s version of events, he nevertheless responded to “lock her up” chants by telling his followers, “Just relax, please. We won the election.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that it was rather creepy to hear Trump declare that he could have “done things” to Clinton “that would have made your head spin.” Instead, let’s consider the underlying point of the rhetoric. The subject is on my mind in part because I talk about this in my new book — which comes out in just a few days — but Trump is rewriting history with a specific goal in mind. In the GOP candidate’s counternarrative, he was “very protective” of his 2016 rival after the election, in part because of his deep commitment to propriety, and in part because he believed it was wrong to use the levers of governmental power to pursue a political rival. As part of the same story — a counternarrative he’s pushed before — voters are also supposed to believe that those rascally Democrats, however, abandoned these principles and prosecuted him after his 2020 defeat, failing to follow the magnanimous example he established a few years earlier. There’s just one fairly obvious problem: Trump’s version of reality is utterly bonkers. As regular readers know, Trump publicly and privately begged prosecutors to charge Clinton. Ahead of Election Day 2020 — nearly four years after Clinton’s defeat — the then-Republican president again publicly called for the Democrat’s incarceration and lobbied then-Attorney General Barr to prosecute the former secretary of state for reasons unknown. None of this was kept secret. It happened out in the open. We all saw it play out in public — all of which makes it a strange thing for the GOP presidential nominee to keep lying about. As for the idea that Trump was uncomfortable with his followers’ “lock her up” chants, and he graciously told them to “just relax,” reality tells a very different story. He not only spent four years in the White House trying to prosecute Clinton — the opposite of “relaxing” — a recent Washington Post report noted, there are ""several instances in which Trump called explicitly for Clinton’s jailing and others in which he agreed with his supporters’ chants.” What’s more, it’s also worth emphasizing for context that Clinton didn’t deserve to be prosecuted, because there was no evidence of her committing any crimes. A jury, on the other hand, recently examined evidence and found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. To be sure, I understand why the former president is trying to rewrite history. Trump now wants the public to believe he took the high road against his former rivals, unlike those Democratic meanies who insist on holding him accountable. In reality, however, Trump desperately tried to weaponize federal law enforcement against his perceived foes — especially Clinton. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Georgia’s election board is out of control. Can anything be done?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/georgia-election-board-trump-2020-fulton-county-rcna165670,"On Tuesday night, as Democrats cheered Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's debut as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, something considerably less joyful was going down in Atlanta. As my colleague Ja'han Jones explained, Georgia's State Election Board, a five-member body controlled by fervent Donald Trump loyalists, adopted a rule allowing local election boards to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" before certifying election results — a task that, pursuant to Georgia statutory law, has long been understood to be mandatory and ministerial. The State Election Board failed to define what constitutes a ""reasonable inquiry"" and suggested — again, in contrast to plain language in Georgia law requiring counties to certify this year's election results by Nov. 12 — that such inquiries could justify failing to certify by that date (or any specific date). But it gets worse. As good government types and local Democrats sputtered, the Georgia election board wasn't quite done. Instead, it met again Wednesday because its very newsy vote Tuesday night meant other agenda items went unaddressed. And at Wednesday's meeting, the board revived a State Election Board complaint known as SEB 2023-025. That complaint alleges ballot tabulation improprieties, including the double counting of roughly 3,000 ballots, in Fulton County during the November 2020 presidential election. In May, the board voted to resolve that complaint by reprimanding Fulton County for such errors and appointing independent election monitors for the upcoming general election. (It's worth noting the double counting, though never conclusively determined, wouldn’t have impacted the outcome of the election.) Yet on Wednesday, despite strenuous objections from the board's chair, John Fervier (an appointee of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican and a Trump foe), and the board's lone Democrat, Sara Tindall Ghazal, the three remaining members reopened that complaint and approved referring it to Georgia's attorney general, Chris Carr. Trump praised those three members for their ""courage"" over the weekend. And lest you think Wednesday's proceedings were too granular for the former president, he indeed was paying attention: Trump not only reposted a six-plus-minute video of the vote and related discussion to Truth Social, but insisted that Carr, Kemp and GOP Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ""MUST get moving on this"" because ""[w]e can't let this happen again. WE MUST WIN GEORGIA IN 2024!!!"" Unsaid, of course, was how yet another investigation of alleged errors in Fulton County's conduct of the 2020 election — none of which would have changed the outcome — relate to the fight for Georgia's electoral votes this year. Nonetheless, focusing solely or mostly on Trump's reaction misses the real danger in how Georgia's State Election Board is conducting itself. During the clip Trump shared, one of the members he has praised, Janelle King, reacted to Fervier's repeat warnings that the board's actions might run counter to state law. For example, according to public reporting, the Georgia attorney general's office — which has now been charged with conducting a new investigation — had advised Fervier that reopening the complaint would itself be unlawful. A source close to the board confirms that Carr's office provided such guidance through a written memo in June. King is a recent addition to the board, chosen after her predecessor, Ed Lindsey, opposed ending no-excuse mail-in voting and then voted against referring the Fulton County complaint to the state attorney general in May. He abruptly resigned on May 15, Rolling Stone reported, leading to King's selection. Thus, one might think that given her relative inexperience, King might reflect on Fervier's concerns with care. Instead, she scoffed, proclaiming that if the meeting were a drinking game and the members each had to drink each time he said that, they’d have been wasted. And then, drunk only on fidelity to Trump, she insisted that irrespective of the law, referring the complaint to the state attorney general was the right thing to do. One last thing: You might be wondering where Raffensperger is in all of this. After all, as Georgia's secretary of state, the administration of the state's elections falls squarely in his domain. In fact, it's precisely because of that domain that Raffensperger — who resisted Trump's infamous Jan. 2, 2021, plea to ""find 11,780 votes"" — fell out with Trump four years ago. The answer is, nowhere — but hardly by Raffensperger's own choice. Following the 2020 election, the Georgia Legislature removed him as a voting member of the Georgia election board. Then, during this past legislative session, they passed legislation ejecting Raffensperger from the board entirely and authorizing the board to investigate him. Nonetheless, Raffensperger continues to focus on real election security measures. While the Georgia election board appeared to flout state law, Raffensperger partnered Wednesday with the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to host a “tabletop exercise” for local election and IT officials to ensure the physical and cybersecurity of the vote in Georgia this November. It's clear, with under 90 days to go before the 2024 general election, that something is amiss in Georgia election administration. But it's not the results of the 2020 election, the conduct of Fulton County, or the actions of Trump's favorite Peach State punching bag, Brad Raffensperger. Rather, the State Election Board is out of control — and it could be that only litigation will stop it from disenfranchising its own citizens. Watch this space."
Why Tim Walz’s progressive policies appeal to both urban and rural America,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-harris-progressive-policies-minnesota-rcna165883,"“Thank you, Madame Vice President, for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy.” That’s how Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota began his first speech as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, the latest development in a seismic two-and-a-half weeks in American politics. This week, thousands gathered in Philadelphia to see Harris and Walz introduce themselves as a ticket.  They cheered for the governor’s zingers and heaped praise upon Harris, nearly blowing the roof off Temple University’s Liacouras Center with the rallying cry, “We’re not going back.” In the City of Brotherly Love, it soon became evident the joy Walz was talking about: the joy of a party that had found its footing after a contentious and, at times, bitterly divided month. A party that had coalesced into a singular force with a unified purpose: defeating Donald Trump in 90 days. As the first “Harris-Walz” branding was still rolling off the presses, political heavy-hitters of all stripes praised Harris’ pick.  Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called it an “excellent” decision. Joe Manchin, the independent (formerly Democratic) senator from West Virginia, said Walz would “bring normality back to the most chaotic political environment that most of us have ever seen.” Even Larry Hogan, the former Republican governor of Maryland who’s running for the U.S. Senate, praised Walz’s “dedication to public service.” Though former President Donald Trump’s campaign insisted Walz would “UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH,” Trump himself appointed Walz in 2019 to serve on the Council of Governors, a bipartisan advisory group that consists of five Democratic and five Republican governors. And ABC News recently unearthed audio of Trump praising the governor’s handling of the 2020 George Floyd protests. Though Twitter isn’t necessarily real life, social media platforms brimmed with praise for Walz, including playful memes and musings that if Harris is “Brat,” Walz is “Midwest Princess.” It’s impressive considering that this time last month, Walz was a virtual unknown outside of Minnesota. A Marist poll released Tuesday found that 71% of Americans had never heard of him. That’s despite a consequential five years as governor and six terms in Congress, where at one point he was rated the seventh most bipartisan member of the 435-member body. But Walz’s unifying ability didn’t begin when Harris chose him as her running mate. Even with a narrow Democratic majority in his state’s Legislature, Walz has managed to enact a host of progressive policies in Minnesota without alienating his rural constituents. He’s secured child tax credits and paid family leave for Minnesotans. He was the first governor to sign abortion rights into law after the fall of Roe v. Wade. He’s championed the safety of trans kids. He’s made roads safer by ensuring undocumented immigrants are eligible for driver's licenses. But nowhere are Walz’s progressive bona fides more evident than his education policy, likely because Walz was a teacher. While Republican governors like Arkansas’ Sarah Huckabee Sanders were signing bills to roll back child labor regulations, Walz was literally embraced by elementary students as he signed a bill ensuring them free breakfast and lunch on school days. Republicans have complained that Walz ensured free menstrual products in student bathrooms (the horror!), but conveniently omit that the policy was secured as part of a $2.2 billion education spending package he signed last year, averaging to $400 in extra funds per student, one of the largest education investments in Minnesota history. These investments don’t stop with grade school. In just a few months, graduating Minnesota students will begin reaping the benefits of North Star Promise, a program Walz signed into law that covers public college tuition and fees for families making under $80,000 thousand a year, regardless of immigration status. Walz seems to realize that even the most divisive policy proposals become popular if they result in tangible benefits. Long gone is the “death panel” fearmongering around the Affordable Care Act; now it enjoys a 62% approval rating, according to KFF, and sees record signups year after year. Opponents of same-sex marriage vowed it would lead to the breakdown of society, but nearly 10 years after marriage equality became law of the land, a Gallup poll found 69% of Americans support it without a second thought. This might be the secret sauce to Walz’s big tent: improvements to people’s lives guided by an appeal to our better natures. Maybe the key to the Harris-Walz campaign’s momentum — and the key to Democrats keeping the White House — lies in bringing back sanity, and with it, the joy.

Donald Trump is struggling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-news-conference-kamabla-harris-rcna165636,"Former President Donald Trump is struggling. It’s been evident for weeks now. The glow hadn’t yet faded on his triumphant performance at the Republican National Convention when President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Since then, Trump has had to face a resurgent opponent with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. And, friends, let me tell you, he is not happy about it. Most infuriating to Trump is his campaign being in a position it has rarely been in: chasing the spotlight. Rather than setting the media’s agenda every day, he’s been forced to watch as Harris has sucked up all the oxygen in the room. The horrible rollout of his own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has only highlighted how energized Democratic voters have become. Worst of all for Trump, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have been drawing massive crowds, a fact that had Trump fuming at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday. Trump hasn’t been doing himself many favors in this post-Biden campaign. While Harris and Walz are crisscrossing six swing states introducing themselves this week, Trump is mostly off the campaign trail. His sudden decision to hold a press event was a clear attempt to draw the focus back to himself, an attempt that will likely prove to be less effective than it’s been in the past. The problem is that Trump and his campaign spent the last several years preparing to run against Biden and are having difficulty shifting gears, despite having reportedly laid some groundwork to face Harris ahead of the swap. This new reality hasn’t set well with Trump at all, who complained (incorrectly) at his news conference that it’s unconstitutional for Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. It appears that, without Biden as a foil, candidate Trump no longer knows who he is. In a sign that everything is totally cool and normal with him, Trump launched into a bit of Biden fanfiction on TruthSocial earlier this week, speculating that the president might try to seize back the nomination at the Democratic National Convention this month. It doesn’t help that the Trump campaign hasn’t landed on an effective message to deploy against Harris beyond the boilerplate anti-Democrat language that typifies the Trump era. (Soft on crime, bad on the border, secretly a communist — you know the drill.) Without a firm strategy in place, we see Trump trying to find something — anything — that works. In the truest to form example, his attack against Harris’ mixed-race background during his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week was reportedly unplanned — and has already fizzled out as a talking point. In his desperation, Trump has also been cycling through potential nicknames for Harris, trying out “Laffin’ Kamala” and “Crazy Kamala” before landing on the baffling choice of “Kamabla.” It’s a choice that’s confusing and unlikely to have any impact on the perception of Harris. It could be a racist dog whistle; it could be a play on the word “blah” to imply that she’s boring; it may be both or neither. (Anyone else old enough to remember former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., clarifying he was talking about “blah” people on welfare, not “Black” people, in a speech?) Trump's outbursts have prompted his staff to run with the ball, like when they threw up projections at a subsequent rally that highlighted Harris’ Indian heritage. The same is true for “Kamabla,” despite it being objective nonsense. HuffPost reporter S.V. Dáte hit up a senior campaign official to ask what it means, the staffer repeatedly only responded with “Kamabla.” See also: This entirely unhelpful X post from Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung: Embracing “Kamabla” is likely to be more about hoping the base joins in on the evident trolling of the libs than any real understanding of what the heck Trump really means. But it’s clearly far from what the campaign and Trump’s closest surrogates wanted him to be doing. As The New York Times put it, “many in Mr. Trump’s party find this all to be counterproductive, to say the least.” It’s a situation that ironically has him “asking friends and allies how his campaign staff is doing — a question that some say could lead to staff changes,” The Washington Post reported. But if we’re being honest, his inability to be anyone other than himself, no matter how much it would benefit him, is a given at this point. Same with the affinity for pithy nicknames thing — it’s something that we’ve come to expect from Trump. These things are baked into his political persona by now, and we’re seeing a repeat of the same old shtick he’s been performing since 2016. In other words, what we’re seeing is Trump hunkering down in his comfort zone, returning to the tricks that have become tropes. It’s wild to realize that what was once shocking from him has become rote, pedestrian even. It’s a feeling that Sid Blumenthal captured in The Guardian when he compared Trump to Laurence Olivier’s character in “The Entertainer,” a man “desperately trying to float his act, shamelessly manipulating and trampling everybody, but incapable of performing anything but the old numbers before a bored audience.” That already threatened to be the case back in 2020, when I noted that Trump was trying to make a shot-by-shot remake of his first campaign. Four years later, he was hoping to try to do the exact same before Harris completely upended that plan. Now, having been denied the rematch that he wanted, Trump is the only one left feeling stale."
Trump and his allies are previewing their election sabotage plan in Georgia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 4:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/georgia-election-board-trump-certification-rcna165784,"Obscure, unelected state government panels aren’t usually a hot election topic. But the Georgia State Election Board has drawn well-deserved national attention with its outrageous actions on Tuesday to pass antidemocratic changes to the battleground state’s election rules. It has provided fodder for Donald Trump, earning sharply partisan praise at his recent Atlanta rally. Now Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp should reverse its rogue actions.  The board used to be a sleepy bipartisan backwater that kept well away from controversy. But earlier this year, the GOP-controlled state Legislature appointed two new members to the five-person panel, transforming it into a Trump-aligned government body. Three of the board’s five members have expressed doubts that President Joe Biden won the state in the 2020 election. The board’s meetings have become a haven for false election conspiracy theories, many based on Trump’s 2020 election lies. Now the board’s MAGA majority is trying to change Georgia’s election rules just ahead of the contest. Its first attempt came last month, only to be reversed after a lawsuit accused the three members of holding an unlawful meeting to ram through the changes. This week, though, they resumed their headlong charge for the Republican nominee.  One of the two new rules passed by the board on Tuesday lets local elections officials halt vote-counting and delay or even outright refuse certification if they contend there are any irregularities, essentially making the certification of election results discretionary. (Georgia law states in multiple places that local election board officials shall perform their duties — meaning their duties are mandatory, not discretionary). Other proposed changes would increase workload demands on overburdened election workers, which could overwhelm county elections offices and ultimately slow down or stop certification. These eleventh-hour changes are supported by Republican Party officials, GOP operatives at the Republican National Committee and MAGA-connected ""election integrity"" activists. These include local elections officials and GOP officials who most likely believe Trump was cheated out of the 2020 election. And all this builds on similar efforts in 2020, when a Coffee County elections official delayed certification of Biden’s Georgia victory and refused to validate the recount results, citing MAGA-backed election conspiracies. The same official allegedly helped Trump campaign operatives breach Coffee County’s voting data days before Jan. 6. According to CNN, Coffee County was specifically cited in draft federal executive orders for seizing voting machines that were presented to Trump in a chaotic Oval Office meeting on Dec. 18, 2020. In the same meeting, Rudy Giuliani alluded to a plan to gain “voluntary access” to Georgia voting machines. The foundation for obstructing certification of the 2024 election results is being laid in Georgia. These newly passed rules changes, along with other proposed changes still being considered by the board, follow refusals from Republican county election board members in Georgia to certify election results in the 2023 local elections and the 2024 primary even though there is no legitimate doubts about the results. And it doesn’t stop there. After Fulton County’s 2024 primary, Fulton County Election Board member Julie Adams filed a suit challenging a badly needed law that prevents local officials from refusing certification. Adams is represented by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute and belongs to the Election Integrity Network, whose founder, Cleta Mitchell, joined Trump’s infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump’s 2020 election interference playbook hasn’t changed, but the MAGA operation has become more sophisticated. Now, there are election deniers holding local elections positions in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania (in addition to Georgia). GOP officials have resisted certifying results in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada.  But Georgia elections are facing an attack from Trump’s operation that seems more intense than any of its other efforts across the country. The state’s current lieutenant governor signed a certificate saying Trump won Georgia in 2020 and certifying himself as a false elector. After failing to overturn his 2020 loss, it seems Trump aims to win Georgia by any means, aided by the State Election Board. Trump may be hinting at this strategy, recently claiming he “didn’t need the votes,” an odd statement for a presidential candidate. Trump’s remarks could be a hint to the re-use of his operation’s 2020 playbook, only better planned and executed. The person best positioned to stop this is Gov. Brian Kemp. Though Kemp has continued to sign voter suppression bills inspired by Trump’s “big lie” into law, he received bipartisan praise for refusing to go along with Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Will Kemp step up again to defend Georgia’s elections from MAGA sabotage? Or will he continue to egg them on as he has in the past couple of Georgia’s legislative sessions?  Georgia law gives Kemp the authority to investigate members of the election board and remove and replace them if they’ve violated Georgia law, which it certainly seems they did by holding an unlawful meeting. Even though Kemp supports Trump’s run for president, he should agree: Trump must win Georgians’ votes fair and square. But the response doesn’t stop with the governor, of course. Others have an important role to play, as well. In the last presidential cycle, pro-democracy activists like Georgia’s Fair Fight (for which one of the co-authors, Groh-Wargo, serves as CEO) built voter protection operations in every crucial battleground state, exposed Trump’s callous voter suppression scheme and helped turn out the vote in 2020 that secured Biden’s Georgia win and delivered control of the U.S. Senate for Democrats. The pro-democracy ecosystem is once again working to protect voters’ ability to stay on the rolls, access the ballot, vote and have their votes counted in 2024. Voters are the last and ultimately most critical line of defense. The best way to ensure election results are certified in a timely manner is with large turnout and decisive margins. Voters everywhere should also check their voter registration status regularly and get their friends and family registered today. It’s also not too early to make a plan to vote, sign up to be a poll worker in your community or get involved with your state Democratic Party’s voter protection team. If we exercise our freedom to vote, we can stop the MAGA election sabotage scheme."
Debunking the GOP's lies about Tim Walz's military record,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fact-check-walz-military-record-swift-boat-rcna165863,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Every year, about 2 million Americans serve in the armed forces, either full time or one weekend a month. These people come from all walks of life and serve in different ways. Many serve as Sen. JD Vance of Ohio did. After high school, Vance signed up for a four-year enlistment in the Marines including six months in Iraq doing public affairs. Then he was honorably discharged.  That’s a bit of a rarity among politicians. Most served as officers after college, which means better pay and benefits. But there is an even rarer experience: Among the tiny fraction of Americans who enlist, a much smaller share make a career of it — serving 20 years or more, with multiple deployments. And only a small fraction of those stay in the service after being disabled on the job. One of them is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, an enlisted soldier in the National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century. A journey that began on a Nebraska farm as soon as he was eligible to join. “My father served during the Korean War. And the day after I turned 17, he took me down to an Army National Guard recruiter and I raised my hand and signed up,” Walz said of his enlistment. That was in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was president. Walz continued to serve for the next 24 years under four commanders in chief. He spent most of that time as an artillery soldier, which took a toll on his hearing. In 2002, after Walz had already done 20 years and qualified for retirement, a medical board considered discharging him because of his hearing loss. Instead, he convinced them to let him complete his final enlistment, which began after 9/11.  Walz achieved theh highest enlisted rank in the Army, command sergeant major. But rather than stay in and complete the schooling for that rank, he retired in 2005 at the rank of master sergeant. In part, he says, because he wanted to speak freely about political injustices, including the Iraq War. The following year, he was one of more than 60 anti-war veterans running for Congress as the “Fighting Dems,” a group that included Sen. Tammy Duckworth, now former Sen. Jim Webb and now former Rep. Patrick Murphy. Following his surprise victory in a traditionally conservative district, Walz became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress. There he worked to help end the military’s anti-gay “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. After Donald Trump was elected president, Walz became the ranking Democrat on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he fought the White House over privatizing veterans’ health care. He also used his own experiences with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to help other veterans get their benefits. Walz’s experience in the armed forces is an atypical one for most Americans, and particularly for politicians. There’s literally no one like him. But now that Walz is running with Vice President Kamala Harris against Trump and Vance, Republicans are trying to “Swift-boat” him — denigrating his service the way they did with Vietnam veteran John Kerry 20 years ago. They claim Walz stole valor and left the Army to avoid going to Iraq. It’s a playbook Republicans also used against Walz when he ran for governor of Minnesota. And it failed then. As it turns out, when voters hear about the quarter century Walz spent as a citizen soldier and the time he has spent since, fighting for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to get the benefits they deserve, they don’t see what Republicans do.  Instead, they see a rare kind of veteran in politics who can cut through the self-serving B.S., rather than adding to it.

Pro-Trump Republicans should think twice about ridiculing ‘Tampon Tim’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tampon-tim-walz-social-media-trump-team-rcna165810,"When I first saw the hashtag #TamponTim circulating on social media, I was excited. What high praise, I thought. As someone who has worked in menstrual equity for the past 15 years, I was grateful that Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was receiving recognition for the significant steps he’s taken to support menstrual equity, including eliminating the tampon tax and ensuring that free menstrual products are available in all public school bathrooms in Minnesota. The nickname, of course, was intended as a slight — spurred by fans of the Trump/Vance ticket as an attempt to ridicule men for standing up for women’s rights and menstrual equity and specifically to contort and promote the hypermasculine message coming from the GOP. But the truth is Gov. Walz’s actions are not just commendable; they are groundbreaking. By removing the tampon tax, he made Minnesota one of the few states to recognize the absurdity of taxing essential health products. Currently, 21 states still impose tampon taxes. The average menstruator spends about $13.25 per month on menstrual products, which amounts to over $6,000 in a lifetime. Eliminating the tampon tax can significantly reduce this financial burden and improve economic inequalities. Walz’s administration also implemented policies ensuring that menstrual products are freely available in public school bathrooms. This move is crucial for students who might experience their first periods unexpectedly or who cannot afford products at home. According to a 2019 study by Plan International USA, 1 in 5 girls in the U.S. has missed school because of lack of access to menstrual products. Period poverty is a real issue in the U.S. Providing free products in schools can help mitigate this issue.  Leaders who acknowledge these issues also help destigmatize menstruation and prevent shame and embarrassment for something that is so natural. These actions demonstrate a genuine commitment to supporting the well-being and dignity of all people who menstruate.  Walz’s push to put menstrual products in all gendered bathrooms is where this amusing, supposedly derogatory, nickname came from. But I really think the name should be embraced and celebrated. Walz’s progressive policies stand in stark contrast to the wave of regressive legislation sweeping across the U.S. Laws like Florida’s “Don’t Say Period” bill, which restricts discussions about menstruation in schools for students under 12, are a blatant attack on freedom and on speech, and are detrimental to the health and dignity of our young people — regardless of whether they bleed or not. In other states, there are moves to subpoena menstrual data, which has the potential to be weaponized against people in states where abortion access is restricted. These laws are not just invasive; they are dangerous. In 2022, Missouri and Florida lawmakers proposed bills to require the tracking of menstrual cycles for minors, raising significant concerns about the potential misuse of such data in states with restrictive abortion laws. Even though the bills have not passed, the initiatives behind them highlight the dangers of overregulating menstruation, which exacerbates a culture of shame and silence around menstruation. Such practices can have serious health and social consequences, underscoring the need for careful consideration of privacy and ethical implications. Unfortunately, periods have been used as a political football in other political fights. Specifically, the anti-trans, anti-abortion, anti-sex education and pro-religion-in-schools groups, which continually use the policing of periods as means to other ends. As a consequence, today there are more laws regulating periods in America than in other countries, highlighting a troubling trend. Walz is a rare example of a politician willing to take a stand for menstrual equity, and we need more like him. The current landscape of laws targeting menstruation is not just absurd; it is alarming.  For the past 15 years, the Desai Foundation, the programmatic nongovernmental organization that I run, has been working in menstrual equity across India and has seen firsthand the consequences of ignorance, debilitating stigmas, limited access to products and other aspects of menstrual equity that lead to impacts on health, reproductive health, education, economic empowerment and beyond.  It’s crucial to build a coalition of policymakers across the U.S. who understand that menstrual equity is a matter of basic human rights. As we look toward future elections, it is essential to remember that bleeders are voters. And there are a lot of them. Politicians who advocate for menstrual equity are likely to gain support from voters who prioritize health, gender equality and reproductive rights.  A 2021 survey by YouGov found that 60% of Americans support eliminating the tampon tax. Think about how that could translate to voters in a presidential election. There is widespread public support for policies that promote menstrual equity; we just need to talk about them more. Let’s encourage more of our representatives to earn nicknames like #TamponTim by supporting initiatives that make real differences in people’s lives and advance menstrual equity."
Desperate right-wingers accuse Tim Walz of being 'anti-white',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 2:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tim-walz-right-wing-attacks-anti-white-rcna165876,"Donald Trump’s campaign and the conservative movement have been grasping at straws trying to tar Kamala Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, since he joined her ticket this week. They have revived previously debunked allegations downplaying Walz’s 24 years of military service. And Trump has said Walz would “unleash hell” on the U.S. and denounced his handling as governor of Minnesota of the 2020 social justice protests — a claim that's undercut by recently unearthed audio in which Trump praised his handling of those protests.  So Republican influencers and media types are pushing another line of attack: claiming Walz secretly despises white people. Newsmax host Rob Schmitt, claiming to know Walz’s true motivations, said on Wednesday that Walz has been eager to “decimate the history of his own state to capitulate to a population of asylum-seekers in this country from Africa.” “Tim Walz is the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people,"" Schmitt argued. “That’s who Tim Walz is. We all know a guy like that. He’s the left-wing cancer that we can’t seem to cure in this country. He is the embodiment of that.” Right-wing activist Christopher Rufo posted a long thread on X suggesting that because Walz may have read Black authors, he's been inspired to “exclude whites from government programs.” That was a dubious characterization of Walz's commitment to distribute 50% of a government funding program to minority business owners. Rufo also retweeted a user who claimed Walz is a “self-hating white man” who’s “trying to be forgiven for his skin crime.” And during a recent appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, former Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota falsely claimed Walz signed a law that “infused all the school curriculum with wokeism” and mandated the teaching of what she called a “George Floyd hate whitey curriculum.” She added, ""Everything is about race. It’s 'hate white people, white people are evil.' And that’s in all of the curriculum.” In reality, Walz signed a law this year that prohibited school libraries from banning a book “based solely on its viewpoint or the messages, ideas, or opinions it conveys,” a counter to Republican efforts to ban books about systemic racism and inequality. That law still allows schools to restrict access to books over ""legitimate"" concerns about appropriateness. These are some of the scare tactics right-wing influencers and media are using, trying to portray a white man who’s shown concern for marginalized people as some sort of menacing, anti-white race traitor. This is a tactic that's been deployed against white Americans who’ve opposed racism in the past. But aside from exposing those who make such claims as bigots, it also makes them look flat-out bizarre. As the Harris campaign continues to make the case to voters that its opponents are “weird,” in plain speak, Republicans can't seem to resist embracing the toxic rhetoric of the darkest right-wing fringe."

The recent attacks from Republicans targeting Minnesota Gov.

They do that to deflect from a record where the cruelty, the violence, the antidemocratic values, the disrespect for our Constitution is the entire point. That’s who they are and that’s what they want to distract from. And to do so, they are trying to tear two very positive, joyful and energetic people down.  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are riding a high right now. Their best strategy is just to keep moving forward and deflect the disinformation that comes their way. But they also need to embrace the joy — which you see them doing.  Just look at the crowds they’re attracting. There has been a burst of energy and enthusiasm. You have people waiting out in the hot sun for hours. When you have to move a rally to an airport hangar, and that’s not even big enough, you’re onto something. Harris isn’t on a roll just with her vice presidential pick, it’s her entire campaign. We know Donald Trump depends on crowd size for his own sense of value. We saw that from his very first event as president, his inauguration, where he had to lie about it. Clearly crowd size is very important to the former president, so what we’re seeing from Harris and Walz will, no doubt, be very scary to the Trump campaign moving forward. And it doesn’t look like their crowds will be getting smaller anytime soon."
What special counsel David Weiss wants to show at Hunter Biden's tax trial,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 1:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/hunter-biden-tax-trial-california-rcna165819,"UPDATE (Thursday, Sept. 5, 2024, 5:06 p.m. ET): Hunter Biden on Thursday pleaded guilty to all nine charges against him in his federal criminal tax case. He initially pleaded not guilty in the case earlier this year. The criminal tax case against Hunter Biden is taking shape ahead of his trial set for next month, with a new court filing providing insight into special counsel David Weiss’ approach.  According to that filing — part of a flurry of pretrial litigation — federal prosecutors want to introduce testimony from an associate with whom, they say, the defendant agreed to help a Romanian businessman contest bribery charges in Romania. Prosecutors say they expect that evidence will show Biden and the associate “received compensation from a foreign principal who was attempting to influence U.S. policy and public opinion and cause the United States to investigate the Romanian investigation.” Prosecutors also want to introduce evidence of Biden’s business dealings with a Chinese energy conglomerate and his compensation for his position on the board of a Ukrainian energy industrial conglomerate. “This evidence will not include evidence that the defendant performed lobbying activity in exchange for this compensation,” prosecutors wrote. “Rather,” they said, “the evidence will show the defendant performed almost no work in exchange for the millions of dollars he received from these entities.” The government filing comes in response to the defense request that the judge exclude allegations of improper political influence or corruption — including any allegations that Biden acted on behalf of a foreign principal to influence U.S. policy or public opinion. His lawyers cited a federal rule that bars one side from introducing unfairly prejudicial evidence against the other. “None of these alleged crimes involve evidence or testimony relating to conspiracy theories about Mr. Biden’s supposed improper political influence and/or corruption, and such evidence or testimony is wholly irrelevant in this case,” they previously wrote to U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in California, who’s presiding over the tax case. In June, the president’s son was found guilty in the separate gun trial prosecuted by Weiss’ team in Delaware, where he is due to be sentenced in November.  When it comes to Biden’s request to exclude allegations of acting on behalf of a foreign principal, prosecutors responded that Biden “did receive compensation from a foreign principal to attempt to influence U.S. policy and public opinion, as alleged in the indictment, and this evidence is relevant and not unfairly prejudicial.” Arguments over what evidence can be introduced at trial happen in every criminal case, though here that exercise is playing out in the extraordinary prosecution of the sitting president’s son. Generally speaking, defendants want to narrow the prosecution’s evidence to make it harder to carry the heavy burden of proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors, meanwhile, want to paint broadly, to tell what they see as the full story surrounding a defendant’s alleged criminality. That full story can involve unsavory elements, which is seemingly what Biden’s lawyers want to prevent. The extent to which they succeed on that score remains to be seen, but the defense may have a difficult task ahead.

JD Vance’s texting relationship with fringe voice comes into view,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-texting-relationship-fringe-voice-comes-view-rcna165866,"For those unfamiliar with Charles Johnson, this week’s Washington Post report on his texting relationship with Sen. JD Vance might not have had a significant impact, but the closer one looks at the details, the worse the story appears. At first blush, some readers are probably shrugging their shoulders. A far-right senator texting with a far-right media personality? This must happen all of the time. But Johnson isn’t just some random conservative blogger. A Semafor report described him as “a notorious Internet troll [whom] the Republican Jewish Coalition had labeled a ‘Holocaust denier.’” And when candidates for national office have texting relationships with someone like this, it’s worth paying attention to. A spokesperson for the senator told Politico this week that Johnson “spam texted” Vance, and the Ohio Republican “usually ignored him.” Similarly, Vance told Semafor, “He’s kind of a crazy person. He’s kind of pathetic, and I just largely ignored him.” This might also seem plausible. Just because some fringe figure obtained the cellphone number of a prominent GOP official doesn’t necessarily mean that the Republican officeholder actually interacted with the figure in a direct and meaningful way. The trouble, however, is that the Post’s reporting tells a very different kind of story. The Post’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that the texts reflected a senator “engaged in the kind of freewheeling communication ordinarily tightly controlled by congressional staff.” This reportedly included the Ohioan asking Johnson for his thoughts on alien spacecrafts, the Republican Party’s position on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. We can probably all think of people in our lives whom we’ve “largely ignored.” We also haven’t sent them a series of texts like these. The more reporting like this comes to light, the tougher it is for Vance to avoid the “weird” label he doesn’t appear to like."
Harris found a pitch-perfect response to the 'lock him up' chants at her rallies,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 12:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-lock-him-up-chants-rallies-rcna165822,"Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have adopted a smart strategy for handling her followers’ (rather ironic) calls for Donald Trump to be incarcerated.  At Harris’ rallies, her supporters have occasionally broken out into chants of “lock him up” when she references the various criminal proceedings against the former president. The chant seems to combine the irony of using the phrase popularized at Trump's rallies against the candidate who pushed false claims of criminality against Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, together with an expression of a very real desire to see Trump held accountable for his actions. But you may have noticed that Harris, a former prosecutor, has never encouraged the chant. Instead, she’s waited for it to die down before going on with her speech.  I suspect she’s done this primarily out of respect for the administration of justice. Even if she does happen to want to see Trump get prison time as a result of being found guilty on 34 felony counts, it wouldn’t be smart — politically or legally — for her to say so. And I suspect she doesn’t want her followers to appear as rabid as Trump’s, despite their conviction that he should go to prison over his criminal conviction.  So I’ve been impressed with how she's responded to these chants by reiterating that her campaign is about more than defeating Trump. “This campaign — our campaign — is not just a fight against Donald Trump,” she said at her rally in Philadelphia this week. “Our campaign — this campaign — is a fight for the future.” Harris put a different twist on that message when the “lock him up” chants broke out during her stump speeches in Wisconsin and Detroit on Wednesday, saying in both speeches, “The courts are going to handle that” and “We’re going to beat him in November.”  It’s a clever play, really. It places Harris above the fray but doesn’t diminish her followers’ energy. And it speaks to voters who may want something to motivate them this November other than accountability for Trump and his illiberalism. "

He finished behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Kenny Bednarek of the United States. An ironclad rule of sports journalism is that there’s no cheering in the press box. Sports journalists are to always exhibit neutrality. We’re human, though, and at times it’s impossible not to become a fan of individual athletes. And I’ll admit that when the men in the 200-meter final settle into their starting blocks Thursday, I’ll be in my living room, ready to cheer American Noah Lyles to victory. Already the 100-meter gold medalist after a thrilling, photo-finish race Sunday night, Lyles will be running to secure his second gold medal in Paris in the event that put him on the path to track and field greatness. On Aug. 4, 2021, in Tokyo, he won a bronze medal in the 200 meters, behind Canada’s Andre DeGrasse and American Kenny Bednarek. Lyles’ loss was one of the surprises of the meet, perhaps behind only Italy’s Marcell Jacobs’ shocking the hell out of the world with his 100-meter win. After that race, in the thick humidity of the mix zone under Tokyo Olympic Stadium, I became a fan. Lyles was spent. He was talking to print and online reporters after he’d already endured more than a dozen television and radio interviews. His initial aloofness gave way to a torrent of emotion, his disappointment at not winning. He cried. He apologized for crying. He expressed his sorrow that his younger brother, Josephus, the one he’d followed into track as a kid so they could be together, wasn’t in Tokyo competing. “This should be him,” he said. He shared more about his nearly lifelong journey with anxiety and depression and how the year leading into those Olympics had been the hardest of his life physically and mentally. A U.S.A. Track & Field media official offered to cut things short. He didn’t take the out. “Having a place where you can actually be OK with letting go of your fears and saying, ‘I am scared,’ because I’ve definitely said that quite a few times this year,” Lyles said. “It’s OK, you know? “I want other people to know that there’s a better way.” After Lyles won the 100-meter race in Paris on Sunday, he posted a message on social media: “I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!” Talking to us reporters under the stadium in Tokyo three years ago, Lyles was raw and vulnerable, in a way we’ve rarely seen from those in the public eye, in a way that we, for far too long, have told athletes, particularly male athletes, isn’t allowed. Thankfully, led in part by Lyles and gymnastics icon Simone Biles, that stigma seems to be melting away. If his tears over not winning the 200 in Tokyo were Lyles’ low point, everything since has propelled him higher and higher.  He has made it his mission to make track and field more popular in the States, in part by making the stadium walk-in photo opportunity, now common in other professional sports, a thing in his sport, too. He’s used it as a time to show off some personality and his fashion sense before showing out when the competition begins. With his big talk and his painted nails, he relishes the pre-meet meetings with media, sometimes poking at his competitors and even athletes outside his sport. He got the attention of NBA stars when he said last year at the world championships that it bothers him to hear the NBA’s title-winning team called world champions when 29 of the 30 teams are in the U.S. (the 30th is in Canada). While he is raising his own profile and chasing Jamaica’s Usain Bolt in the record book, other American track standouts could reap the benefits of the increased exposure. More than the walk-in photo-ops and the entertaining news conferences, however, Lyles knew that the real way to make himself a household name was to win what counts as the marquee event at every Olympics and perhaps across all sports: the men’s 100-meter gold and the accompanying title of “world’s fastest man.” Lyles had always included 100-meter races on his schedule (he has called the race his mistress, while the 200 meters is his wife), and he ran an impressive 9.86 at a Diamond League race in China in 2018. But he failed to secure a spot in the 100 meters when he finished seventh of eight runners in the final at the U.S. Olympic Trials in 2021. He announced last year that he would become world champion in both the 200 and the 100 meters in Budapest, Hungary. Given that his biggest liability in the 100 meters was — and remains — his block starts, it was a lofty goal. The 27-year-old, one of the rare track and field athletes to jump from high school to the pros, met that first goal: He won three golds in Budapest, surprising the field with his 10-meter victory, getting his third consecutive 200-meter world championship and joining with Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Brandon Carnes to win the 4x100-meter relay. The success only fueled him to match the feat at the Olympics. He got that 100-meter gold by the smallest of margins and still has his signature event on deck. The Americans are also the favorite in the relay, but after the disaster of Tokyo, where they didn’t even qualify for the medal race, the latest in a comedy of errors that hasn’t seen the U.S. win a medal in the men’s 4x100 since 2004 or a gold since 2000, it might not be a given. But from what we’ve seen of Lyles since that night in Tokyo, when he was despondent and bared his soul to a cadre of socially distanced strangers, it will be hard to bet against them. And hard not to cheer for him."
Trump’s ‘drill baby drill’ plan: The wrong answer to the right questions,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 9:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-drill-baby-drill-plan-wrong-answer-right-questions-rcna165805,"A few months ago, after a monthly unemployment report reached the public, a reporter asked Donald Trump about his jobs plan. “My plan for jobs is to drill baby drill, bring energy down,” the former president replied. That didn’t make any sense — oil drilling does not have a meaningful impact on unemployment — but the Republican didn’t seem to care. The exchange came to mind anew during Trump’s latest Fox News appearance. HuffPost reported on a question the GOP candidate heard from a voter at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota. After initially mentioning how popular he believes he is among those at the event, the next words out of Trump’s mouth were, “We are going to drill baby drill; we’re going to bring down the cost of energy. Energy’s what caused the worst inflation, I think, in the history of our country.” The comments were widely derided, and for good reason: Trump heard a good question, and he responded with a nonsensical answer. Right off the bat, it’s worth emphasizing that while recent inflation rates imposed a real burden on millions of Americans, the problem wasn’t close to being the worst inflation in American history. What’s more, the former president’s indifference to the substance of governing is the stuff of legend — it was the basis for much of my first book — and his latest rhetoric doesn’t help matters. Asked about his jobs plan, Trump pointed to oil drilling. Asked about housing affordability, Trump again pointed to oil drilling. It seems like only a matter of time before he starts saying “drill baby drill” in response to questions about health care and education, too. I realize the GOP nominee isn’t literally going to say, “I don’t have an actual policy agenda,” but he’s implicitly making that point clear. But perhaps most important of all is Trump’s apparent ignorance about the status quo when it comes to energy policy: We’re already drilling. In fact, the United States during the Biden-Harris administration has not only produced more energy than any other country on the planet, energy production in the United States under Biden-Harris has also reached an all-time high. And it’s not just oil. U.S. production of natural gas, solar, wind generation, and battery storage have also all reached record highs under the incumbent Democratic administration. The country, in other words, is already doing the one thing Trump sees as the magical solution to domestic challenges, leaving us with a straightforward question: Does he not know the truth, or is he counting on voters not to know the truth?"
Challenge to Walz-signed voting rights law rejected by Minnesota Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/walz-voting-rights-minnesota-supreme-court-rcna165762,"The Trump campaign — that is, the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, the Republican who was found guilty of felonies in one case and accused of them in three others — has attacked Tim Walz for supporting voting rights for people convicted of felonies. As it happens, the Minnesota Supreme Court just rejected a challenge to a law on the subject that was signed by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate.   The state’s top court on Wednesday did not rule on the merits of the Re-Enfranchisement Act, which took effect last year after Walz, the state’s Democratic governor, signed it into law. Instead, the state justices rejected the bid because it found no legal standing to bring the case. Individual taxpayers and the self-styled “election integrity” watchdog group to which they belong, the Minnesota Voters Alliance, argued that the new voting provision violated the state constitution and that it’s therefore illegal to use public funds to educate people about it. But the state justices said the challengers had no legal right to bring the claim, citing so-called taxpayer and associational standing. “We share the district court’s concern that granting taxpayer standing in this case ‘would render the very concept of taxpayer standing meaningless’ because ‘practically every law entails at least some public expenditure,’” state chief justice Natalie Hudson wrote for the court. “We can discern no principled limitation to the theory of taxpayer standing advanced by the Taxpayers that would prevent the concept of taxpayer standing from becoming meaningless by allowing parties to challenge substantive government acts that involve incidental expenditures,” Hudson continued, adding that taxpayers can’t “manufacture standing by pointing to expenditures that are incidental to implementing the law.” Because the taxpayers lacked standing, so too did their group, Hudson noted. If the concept of standing sounds familiar, it was on those grounds that the Supreme Court rejected the challenge to mifepristone this past term, because the anti-abortion doctors and groups in that case lacked a sufficient legal stake to complain. Likewise here, the legal doctrine effectively blocked a court challenge to voting as it did to abortion in the mifepristone case. In that Supreme Court case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s unanimous opinion recalled the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s refrain that the standing analysis asks: “What’s it to you?” Or, as Walz himself put it in another context recently: “Mind your own damn business.”   Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Louisiana officials defend the Ten Commandments by cheapening them,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 9:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/louisiana-ten-commandments-law-school-posters-rcna165440,"On Sunday, the members of my Baptist church in New Orleans recited our church covenant, a public declaration of the ways we’ll demonstrate our faith that includes a commitment to “religiously training our children.” Though we recite this covenant once a month, this particular Sunday’s recitation was different. We uttered those words while entering the era in which the state of Louisiana has taken that role of religious “training” upon itself. The Louisiana Legislature has decreed that, beginning this year, every classroom in every public school must prominently display the Ten Commandments. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who triumphantly signed the bill in June, said last month that the 20-year-old man who fired a rifle at former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania might not have done so if his classrooms had displayed the Ten Commandments. There’s no honest way to read the Bible — or any literature on human behavior — and reach such a conclusion. If anything, the Bible’s message is the opposite: that a commandment not to do something will be followed by people doing that forbidden thing. That’s not to say that the Ten Commandments are a provocation to do wrong, only that plenty of wrong has been done by those who’ve seen the Ten Commandments. One must ignore thousands of years of data to treat the Ten Commandments as a prophylactic against wrongdoing. But such illogic is typical of Landry, a former state attorney general. Yet the bigger issue for me — as someone who grew up in a denomination that is largely responsible for the existence of the First Amendment and as the father of a public-school student in Louisiana — is that the law wrongly gives the state a role in religious instruction. This gross overreach should offend not just Baptists, but anyone who professes to be guided by the Constitution and anyone who wants the government to leave them alone. And after the preposterous arguments made by Landry and Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill at a Monday news conference, even those who think the government should honor and promote their religious beliefs have reason to be upset. In providing a federal court examples of Ten Commandments posters that they say pass constitutional muster, Landry and Murrill trivialized the significance of the Ten Commandments by putting them on the same level as pop culture. A teacher would be adhering to the law and avoiding any kind of constitutional violation, Louisiana says in its court brief, by putting a photo of Charlton Heston playing Moses and holding the Ten Commandments on one side of a poster and a photo of Lin-Manuel Miranda playing Alexander Hamilton and the “Ten Duel Commandments” on the other side. Similarly, a teacher could put up a cartoon depiction of an electronic tablet (such as an iPad or Kindle Fire or Samsung Galaxy) referring to the Ten Commandments as “the original tablet.” They even made a Ten Commandments poster with a meme taken from the movie “Mean Girls” in which a character asks, “Why are you so obsessed with me?” According to the brief, a teacher could put headlines from stories about the ACLU fighting laws requiring the display of the Ten Commandments on such a poster and satisfy Louisiana law without offending the Constitution. Is it really Louisiana’s argument that posters such as these not only honor the Ten Commandments, but would also provide the moral instruction that would have deterred Trump’s would-be assassin? If so, would a poster that lists the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ten Crack Commandments” have done the trick, too? No posters have appeared in my daughter’s classrooms, and it’s unclear if any have appeared in classrooms across the state. Because the law gives schools until January to comply, school officials likely are waiting until the new year, especially as courts weigh a challenge to the law’s constitutionality. In that Monday news conference, Landry additionally attempted to defend the law by pointing out that it passed overwhelmingly and was supported by some Democrats. But the two parties in Louisiana have often coalesced around bad ideas, and this is no exception. Regardless, the share of lawmakers supporting a law has no bearing on its constitutionality. If every Louisiana lawmaker voted for it, that wouldn’t prevent a court from declaring it problematic. But Landry argues that legislative might makes right and that parents who don’t want the state forcing their children to see the Ten Commandments ought to just tell their children “not to look at them.” He said Monday, “I think we’ve forgotten in this country that democracy actually means majority rule.” There, Landry betrays his intentions. I doubt he believes that putting up posters of the Ten Commandments will deter mass shooters. I do believe he thinks that putting them up shows folks who’s in charge in Louisiana. That kind of belief in “majority rule” made 18th-century Baptists insist upon the prohibition against the establishment of religion that appears in the First Amendment. They knew that unchecked “majority rule” is incompatible with freedom — no matter how many lawmakers vote otherwise."

"Flunking self-awareness again, Trump bemoans ‘Pro Criminal Atmosphere’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/flunking-self-awareness-trump-bemoans-criminal-atmosphere-rcna165785,"After Gov. Tim Walz joined the Democrats’ 2024 ticket this week, Donald Trump’s campaign team wasted little time in targeting the Minnesotan with attacks that appeared pre-packaged. One part of the offensive, however, stood out. Walz, Team Trump told voters, has a record of “embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.” Putting aside the fact that the governor did, in fact, restore voting rights for formerly incarcerated people — a popular and just position — the line of attack flunked a rather obvious test of self-awareness: A jury recently found the former president guilty of 34 felonies. The press release from Team Trump was intended to make it seem as if Walz has somehow been soft on criminals, which might’ve been more sensible if Trump weren’t already a criminal. Thursday morning — just two days after extensive coverage of his campaign’s misstep on Monday — the former president made the same self-defeating mistake. In a message published to his social media platform, Trump wrote: This was not an isolated comment. The GOP candidate recently declared with confidence at a public event, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” the Republican nominee said. “They generally stay a criminal, and we do not have time to figure it out.” This need not be complicated. A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. He's also still facing several dozen other pending felony counts, across multiple jurisdictions. If it's effectively impossible to “teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” he should probably drop out of the 2024 race immediately. What’s more, the former president has also surrounded himself with other criminals. “With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley recently noted. “With Trump, you have a team of felons.” In case that weren’t quite enough, during his failed presidency, Trump had a habit of issuing scandalous pardons to politically aligned criminals, and if elected to a second term, the Republican has promised to issue even more pardons to politically aligned criminals — including those who violently clashed with police officers. If Trump is looking for evidence of an actual “pro-criminal atmosphere,” he can actually find one in his own political operation. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Trump, Vance pick a fight over antisemitism they can’t win",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 7:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-pick-fight-antisemitism-cant-win-rcna165767,"Almost immediately after Vice President Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Donald Trump thought it’d be a good idea to falsely accuse her of antisemitism. Harris, the Republican said, is “totally against the Jewish people” — which was a curious claim about someone with a Jewish husband. But this week, the ugly offensive managed to get considerably worse. Before Harris announced her 2024 running mate, GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance said that if the Democrat didn’t choose Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, it would be “out of antisemitism.” After Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the ticket, the Republicans’ antisemitism smear reached new heights. If the vice president seriously considered a Jewish running mate before ultimately settling on one of his rivals, the right argued, then clearly Harris and her party have a problem with Jews. When Vance was asked if he had any evidence to support the idea that Harris is antisemitic, the Ohio Republican responded by complaining about the question — which he didn’t get around to answering. Nevertheless, around the same time, Trump appeared on Fox and suggested that Shapiro was passed over for the Democratic ticket “because of the fact that he’s Jewish.” All of this is so utterly bonkers, it’s difficult to know where to start, but let’s review a handful of relevant data points. The idea that Democrats are antisemites, denying political opportunities and leadership positions to Jews, is obviously not to be taken seriously. But making matters considerably worse are some of the other relevant details from recent years. Trump, for example, continues to peddle antisemitic tropes as a matter of course. He also hung out with some notorious antisemites at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. All of which is to say, Republicans might see value in picking this fight, but it’s not one they should expect to win."
"On possible vice presidential debate, Vance has a Trumpian answer",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/possible-presidential-debate-vance-trumpian-answer-rcna165759,"When Gov. Tim Walz made his public introduction as his party’s vice presidential candidate this week, the Minnesota Democrat turned his attention to possibly sharing a stage with Sen. JD Vance. “I can’t wait to debate the guy — that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,” Walz said. Putting aside the governor’s crude subtext, the comments helped spark renewed interest in a possible showdown: Donald Trump appears to be afraid of Vice President Kamala Harris, but will Vance agree to debate Walz? The Ohio Republican fielded a question on this on Wednesday, but as a report in The New Republic noted, his answer wasn’t altogether helpful. As part of the same answer, Vance, in apparent seriousness, said Harris doesn’t yet know whether she’ll be her party’s presidential nominee, adding, “[W]e don’t know who the vice presidential nominee is going to be, either.” The Republican concluded that Democrats might yet “pull a bait and switch” and dump Walz from the ticket, which is why, Vance added, he’s “all game” to hold a vice presidential debate with Harris next week. In other words, those hoping to watch a Walz/Vance debate should probably start lowering their expectations. As for the top of the parties’ respective tickets, the GOP presidential nominee shared some new rhetoric on the subject during his latest Fox News interview. The New York Times reported: Trump concluded, “Look, she doesn’t want to debate.” It’s not the first time the former president, who obviously doesn’t want to debate, has engaged in projection, and it probably won’t be the last."
"It’s not just birtherism making a comeback, so is Swift-boating",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/birtherism-swift-boating-election-2024-trump-vance-walz-military-rcna165748,"Donald Trump recently thought it would be a good idea to go after Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity and start promoting messages related to the Democrat’s birth certificate. For those familiar with the Republican’s record of racist antics, the strategy was painfully familiar: Axios described it as “Trump’s new birtherism.” But as it turns out, that’s not the only ugly tactic from the GOP’s recent past that the party’s 2024 ticket is eager to recycle. In 2004, a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, bankrolled in part by a Republican megadonor and Justice Clarence Thomas benefactor, smeared then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry’s military service. The deceptive operation was guided in part by a GOP consultant named Chris LaCivita. Twenty years later, LaCivita is a top member of Trump’s 2024 operation, and wouldn’t you know it, Swift-boating, like birtherism, is making a sudden comeback. NBC News reported: “What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage,” Sen. JD Vance told reporters on Wednesday. The Ohio Republican’s use of the word “garbage” rang true, but not for the reasons the vice presidential nominee probably intended. Based on all of the available evidence, this line of attack appears utterly baseless. Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard as a teenager, and his military service spanned nearly a quarter of a century. The Minnesotan served honorably, rose to the rank of command sergeant major, and retired as a master sergeant in 2005. Months after his retirement, Walz’s unit was deployed, which is apparently of interest to the Republican attack machine, but which does not appear to be controversial. In fact, Vote Vets, a progressive veterans group, published a brief summary, fact-checking the anti-Walz smear, and helping set the record straight. Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, had a related, similarly pointed message, making the case that Vance probably shouldn’t be too eager to compare his service record with Walz’s. But if the far-right senator was a poor messenger for this message, Trump was worse. The former president called Walz a “DISGRACE” by way of his social media platform, and added some related online attacks overnight. Not to put too fine a point on this, but this is a fight Cadet Bone Spurs should probably avoid. Not only did Trump avoid military service when many in his generation served, but members of his own team have told the public that the Republican has denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers” and “losers.” Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, disparaged wounded veterans, referred to soldiers missing in action as “losers,” blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, downplayed the importance of troops with traumatic brain injuries, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, “I like people that weren’t captured, okay?” If the GOP candidate thinks he can be a credible critic of Walz’s lengthy and honorable military service, he’s mistaken."
Tim Walz is the political ally trans people need and deserve,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-political-ally-lgbtq-voters-rcna165372,"Tuesday morning’s announcement that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election electrified Democrats and their allies across the country. Everyone from progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to notorious centrist Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia praised the pick, bringing long elusive unity to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket for the first time in several election cycles. One small but beleaguered voting constituency in particular breathed a sigh of relief at the choice: trans people. Trans issues have emerged as one of the primary political targets of the Republican Party, and many of the party’s legislative accomplishments over the last few years involve the systematic persecution of trans people’s rights in red-state legislatures. Because of that, Harris needed to choose someone with a track record of handling the inevitable gender identity attacks. Enter Walz. First and foremost, Walz was the creator of the “weird” attack line that has knocked Republicans on their heels over the last month of the campaign. Branding Republicans and their gender-based obsessions with pregnancy and trans people as creepy and “weird” brilliantly defuses the emotional manipulation conservatives are trying to achieve. It is, indeed, weird to be worried about children’s genitals, it is weird to obsess over Olympic athlete’s chromosomes, it is weird to criticize women for being childless (but never childless men).  But beyond being the creator of the most incisive Democratic attack line of the cycle, Walz has a deep track record of supporting LGBTQ people and pro-equality policies. As governor, he signed an executive order last year protecting trans people’s rights to access gender-affirming care in Minnesota, he signed a statewide ban on LGBTQ “conversion therapy,” and he signed a bill making his state a trans refuge state, which protects trans people and their parents from actions taken by out-of-state governments to prosecute them for accessing gender-affirming care. As a member of Congress, prior to becoming governor, Walz co-sponsored a bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, along with a bill to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy — which had prohibited openly gay people from serving in the armed forces. Outside of his official record on queer and trans issues, I’m struck by how he talks about the trans people in his state. In a time when a lot of national level Democrats are afraid to even say the word “trans” or who speak in euphemisms with vague references to allowing people “to be who they are,” Walz positions his support for trans issues as a matter of being neighborly. “We are saying to our trans loved ones, friends, neighbors, and fellow Minnesotans: you belong here,” he said in a statement after signing the aforementioned executive order. “You are safe here, and we want you in our community as your authentic selves.” It’s clear that he treats LGBTQ people with respect and dignity, worrying more about their well-being than political optics. His support for queer people even predates his time in politics. In 1999, when he was a teacher and a high school football coach, a gay student came out to him and said they wanted to start a Gay Straight Alliance at the school. Walz became the founding faculty adviser for the club. This anecdote struck me, as I was a closeted high school student myself in 1999, though I lived in liberal Massachusetts instead of Minnesota. Despite being in a very deep-blue town, we didn’t have a GSA, and “gay” was used as a synonym for “bad” back then. I vividly remember a goth boy in my school who frequently wore dresses to school and would occasionally get beaten up by football players. The idea of coming out back then was too terrifying to attempt, much less deciding to come out to the football coach. The fact that the student trusted Walz enough to do that tells me a lot about the candidate’s character and demeanor. The fact that Walz then decided to jump in and help found the school’s GSA is simply astounding to me. LGBTQ voters who care about equality across the community should be breathing a little easier at the prospect of Walz’s having a voice and a hand in the everyday operations of the White House should the ticket win this fall. As a trans person whose job it is to write about politics, I couldn’t be happier with Harris’ choice for running mate."
Tim Walz is giving MAGA a master class in manhood,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tim-walz-manhood-masculinity-trump-maga-rcna165649,"Tim Walz’s first official speech on the Democratic ticket displayed all the reasons that Kamala Harris has been lauded for picking the Minnesota governor as her running mate. Personally, I think one outshines all the rest. Walz’s military background and his work as a high school teacher and football coach, along with his palpable joy and open expressions of compassion for people in need, offer America a vision of what manhood can look like — he’s a “joyful warrior” offering a vision in contrast with what’s being offered by Donald Trump’s bravado-driven campaign. And he’s clearly willing to challenge Team Trump on that front. He displayed that even before he received the call to join Harris’ campaign, using public appearances to refer to Trump and his allies as “bullies” who are truly weak at heart and by mocking the GOP ticket for “running for He-Man Women Haters Club or something.” In his Philadelphia speech Tuesday, Walz showed he wants all the smoke with JD Vance in a vice presidential debate, saying that he’s excited for the event to happen — “that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.” That burn, a passing reference to a crude joke about Vance that spread on social media, was affirmation for me: This is a man willing and ready to challenge toxic MAGA masculinity. I don’t think I’m alone in my belief. I’ve been seeing posts on social media praising Walz for embodying a more refreshing and humane idea of manhood than anything conservatives are offering. And Harris seems to understand that, as well. In her speech introducing Walz to voters, Harris took time to lay out his “tough guy” bona fides but smartly laid out how they gave him a compassionate perspective. She mentioned that Walz is an elite marksman who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before explaining that he supports gun safety laws. She delved into his success as a high school teacher and championship-winning football coach — referring to him as “Coach Walz” multiple times — before explaining that he also thought it was important to serve as the faculty adviser for his school’s gay-straight alliance organization. She referred to his early life on a farm in the Nebraska Plains, saying their similar upbringings in middle-class families taught them the importance of “lifting people up, not knocking them down.” Harris essentially built Walz up as a kindhearted tough guy who is eager to do good. And the contrast with the Republican ticket could not be clearer. Trump has essentially built his campaign around a puerile, hypermasculine identity that’s steeped in faux machismo, violence, crassness and indifference to the oppression of marginalized groups. It’s a schoolyard bully’s concept of what a man should be. But Walz is schooling them thus far, showing Trump and Vance — and voters nationwide — that manhood can be more than a repressive drag on society."
What Josh Shapiro should do now,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 3:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-josh-shapiro-vp-pennsylvania-support-rcna165578,"Vice President Kamala Harris made an excellent choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for her running mate. The dynamic yet plain-speaking Walz brings his Midwestern roots and proven track record of progressive accomplishments to the ticket. He’s also skilled in his ability to effectively message against Republicans — a strength Democrats have sorely lacked.  Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro had been among the three finalists to fill out the Democratic ticket, and there were reports that the popular chief executive of swing-state Pennsylvania had conveyed to Harris’ team his struggle with the decision to leave his current role as governor to pursue the vice presidency. And there was pushback from a number of Democratic key constituencies — specifically, public school education advocates’ expressing concerns about Shapiro’s embrace of private school vouchers and the National Women’s Defense League’s voicing doubts about his handling of sexual harassment complaints against a former staffer.  But at Tuesday’s campaign event in Philadelphia — where Walz was introduced as Harris’ running mate — Shapiro warmed up the audience with an inspiring and booming speech in his hometown. Shapiro passionately declared that freedom was on the ballot and joined the crowd in chanting the Harris campaign slogan, “We’re not going back.”  This moment marks not an end but a potentially new beginning for Shapiro. As the Democratic Party unites behind the Harris-Walz ticket, it must leverage governors like Shapiro as invaluable surrogates. His crucial political and communication skills can amplify three key strategies: aggressively campaigning in Rust Belt states, highlighting the Biden administration’s successes and reshaping narratives about the administration’s challenges in conservative-leaning media.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee should also deploy Shapiro to key purple districts where Democrats need wins to maintain control of the House, capitalizing on his broad appeal in purple Pennsylvania.  Shapiro’s campaigning prowess is undeniable. With a 62% favorability rating in Pennsylvania and his experience defeating a pro-MAGA candidate who espoused wild conspiracy theories, his ability to cut through political noise will be invaluable. The campaign must maintain a strong presence in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — with Shapiro showcasing his success as a young, accomplished and battle-tested governor in a swing state. Furthermore, Shapiro’s top-notch communication skills are essential in today’s media landscape. A Pew Research study revealed that 86% of Americans often or sometimes get news from digital devices. Shapiro has already proven his effectiveness on platforms like “The Breakfast Club,” a popular internet radio show. While it’s important for him to appear on left-leaning podcasts like “Pod Save America,” Democrats must also engage with conservative platforms to broaden their reach. But to truly serve as an effective national surrogate, Shapiro must address his past controversies, particularly those surrounding public education.  He should highlight his support for public schools, pointing to Pennsylvania’s recent $1.1 billion increase for K-12 public education in the state’s budget — the largest single-year bump in the state’s history — while reconsidering his stance on vouchers, which, for the most part, are Republican-supported tax subsidies for existing private school families and no-strings-attached bailouts for struggling private schools. In Florida, 70% of voucher recipients were already in private schools, and some families used the tax dollars to buy big screen TVs and trips to Disney World.  Moreover, research has demonstrated that students who used vouchers to enroll in private schools performed, on average, worse than the students in the public schools they left. Public schools play a vital role in building the next generation of Americans, and if Shapiro wants to show the country he could be a leader of the future, he cannot support taking money away from the institutions that teach our children. America is great because of public schools — they bring together students of diverse backgrounds and help ensure every kid gets a quality education. Any Democrat who wants to lead the party cannot value subsidizing private education for rich people over protecting public schools for working families. Shapiro is poised to be a powerful surrogate for the Harris-Walz ticket. To be a genuine asset to the Democratic campaign, he must build on his strengths, pivot from past controversies and focus on being an exceptional campaigner. By leveraging Shapiro’s skills alongside Walz’s in Rust Belt states, Democrats can energize their big tent coalition to protect democracy and prevent the Trump-Vance ticket from taking the White House."
How Tim Walz went from an 'A' NRA rating to the gun lobby's worst nightmare,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tim-walz-nra-gun-control-evolution-2024-rcna165589,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight,"" guest hosted by Jen Psaki. In 2010, then-Rep. Tim Walz ran a radio ad for his re-election campaign, proudly declaring his support for the National Rifle Association: “Growing up, hunting taught me a lot about responsibility and respect. Lessons I hope to pass on to my kids. I’m proud to stand with the NRA to protect the rights of sportsmen and gun owners,” Walz said at the time.   That same year, not only did the NRA give Walz an “A” rating but the gun group endorsed him over his Republican challenger. And in 2016, “Guns and Ammo” Magazine named the Democrat one of the “Top 20 Politicians for Gun Owners.” Fast-forward to 2023 and here's what Walz, now serving as governor of Minnesota, had to say during his State of the State address: One month after that speech, Gov. Walz did just that: He signed a bill creating a red flag law and expanding background checks for gun owners in Minnesota. There are already plenty of articles online slamming Walz as a “political chameleon” or claiming that he made an “epic flip-flop” on guns. But that simply is not true. This change for Walz had been more than a decade in the making. In the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012 — a shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead — Walz wasn’t sure what the answer was on how to address gun violence but he told the media he wasn’t “willing to do nothing.” After the Las Vegas shooting in 2017 killed nearly 60 people and injured almost 500, Walz donated every penny he had ever received from the NRA to charity. In 2018, after the Parkland high school shooting killed 17 people and injured 17 more, Walz got a wake-up call from his own daughter, Hope. He recounted a conversation where she told him, “Dad you’re the only person I know who is in elected office, you need to stop what’s happening with this.” Walz promised to act and said he would “take [his] kick in the butt from the NRA.” Shortly after that shooting, Walz became one of the co-sponsors of the House’s assault weapons ban legislation.  He explained that decision in a video to his constituents:  ""If the question was, how do you get there? I’ve been open to it. I’ve listened. I’ve talked to people. I’ve watched people on both sides of this. But again, when I turn on my television like everybody else and this is repeated again and we’re not doing anything about it … I’ve seen enough. I’ve seen enough of this carnage.” So yes, Walz’s position on how we should address gun violence has changed over the years — it was an evolution. And I bet a heck of a lot of Americans went through that same evolution with him.  The willingness to acknowledge and change your view isn’t a weakness in a leader —  it’s a strength.

Joining them in neighborhoods like Finchley and Harrow were hundreds of counter-protestors carrying signs that said, ‘Refugees Welcome’ and ‘Racists Out, Refugees In.’” * A scary story out of Austria: “Two men were arrested Wednesday in connection with alleged planned attacks at major events in Vienna, Austria, including Taylor Swift’s upcoming concerts. ... Officials said both men had become radicalized through the internet, and allegedly had specific and detailed plans on how to carry out an attack.” * The latest Jan. 6 indictment: “A California woman is charged with taking a cache of weapons, including a sword, a steel whip and a knife into the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by a mob of Donald Trump supporters, according to court records unsealed Wednesday. Kennedy Lindsey had a short sword, a steel tactical whip, a collapsible baton, pepper spray, a butterfly knife and a flashlight taser in her possession when a U.S. Secret Service officer searched her backpack, according to an FBI affidavit.” * NASA is apparently exploring backup options: “For weeks, NASA has downplayed problems experienced by Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft that took two astronauts to the International Space Station in June. But on Wednesday, NASA officials admitted that the problems with the spacecraft were more serious than first thought and that the astronauts may not travel home on the Boeing vehicle, after all.” See you tomorrow."
Why Trump hasn't been charged in the Arizona 2020 fake electors case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 1:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fake-electors-arizona-2020-rcna165584,"Why wasn’t Donald Trump charged in Arizona’s 2020 election-related prosecution? When the indictment came down in April, I noted some possible reasons while emphasizing that “we don’t know exactly what happened in the grand jury and what grand jurors thought of any potential charges against the former president.” We now have some insight into the state of grand jurors’ thinking: Apparently, they were interested in charging the former president. But the state wasn’t.   That revelation comes in a court filing by state prosecutors this week. Responding to the defense claim that the charges are politically biased, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes’ office noted that it asked the grand jury not to charge several Republicans, including Trump. Explaining why, the prosecution cited the U.S. Justice Department’s policy regarding overlapping charges by federal and state prosecutors. The filing excerpted the following remarks by a prosecutor to the grand jury: So, what is this DOJ policy, exactly? Known as the “Petite Policy,” it “establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion by appropriate officers of the Department of Justice in determining whether to bring a federal prosecution based on substantially the same act(s) or transactions involved in a prior state or federal proceeding.” Notably, that’s not the situation here. That is, it’s not a question of a federal prosecution following a prior state or federal one, but rather a state prosecution following a federal one. And of course, this is guidance for federal prosecutors, not for state prosecutors generally (or Arizona in particular), though it instructs federal prosecutors to consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests involved, and, if possible, to resolve all criminal liability for the acts in question.” And while Trump has been charged federally by special counsel Jack Smith, he was also charged in the related state case in Georgia. Clearly, federal policy didn’t prevent Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from bringing that indictment. The fate of both of those cases is uncertain, however, due to the Supreme Court immunity ruling’s possible implications for both prosecutions and, when it comes to the Georgia case, the pending pretrial defense challenge to disqualify Willis. Just because Trump hasn’t been charged in Arizona doesn’t mean he won’t ever be. If he becomes president again, he’ll gain the power to crush his federal election interference case. To the extent that the existence of that federal case is what’s holding Arizona prosecutors back, its disappearance could change their calculus — though, in the hypothetical scenario in which Trump is re-elected, any prosecution proceeding against him would likely have to wait until he was out of office again to get going. For now, though, as to why Trump wasn’t initially charged in Arizona, it wasn’t for lack of interest on the grand jury’s part.

Georgia’s elections board just made it easier for Trump loyalists to delay the certification of votes,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 1:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/georgia-election-board-trump-loyalists-votes-rcna165583,"On Tuesday, a Republican majority on Georgia’s State Election Board voted to change the process for certifying election results in a way that could allow Trump-supporting election deniers in key positions to dubiously cause delays. The three members who voted for the change had been praised by Donald Trump by name at his rally in Atlanta over the weekend. The changes are disturbing — and justifiably being met with outrage — given that Team Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election involved calling for state election officials to delay certification, potentially allowing the Republican-packed Supreme Court to weigh in, or even the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. It didn’t work, but Republicans have since taken control of several powerful positions overseeing local elections in battleground states, which could make a similar scheme more successful this time. Atlanta-based journalist George Chidi summed up Tuesday’s vote well for The Guardian: Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, seemed eager to downplay concerns about the change.  “Georgia’s Election Integrity Act requires counties to certify the election results by November 12th and we fully anticipate that counties will follow the law,” he wrote on X. But whether or not Republicans end up being able to use this particular mechanism to undermine democracy, Raffensperger’s assurance doesn’t change the fact that Georgia Republicans have made moves to enhance their electoral chances — and established avenues to sow chaos and potentially undermine results that don’t break their way. They’ve accomplished this by passing voter suppression laws that have created hurdles for liberal-leaning constituencies — such as Black voters and young voters; mass purges of voter rolls, largely at the behest of right-wing activists; gerrymandering districts to water down Black voters’ electoral power; and, indeed, with votes like the one we saw Tuesday. Republicans have spent years gaslighting Americans about “rigged” elections. Meanwhile, they’ve broadly done everything in their power to tip the scales come November. And Georgia is a prime example."
Bitter Trump-Vance campaign is no match for Harris-Walz joy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-tim-walz-donald-trump-campaign-rally-contrast-2024-rcna165574,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Even conservatives have been talking about Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz’s rally on Tuesday, remarking how well those two did — and the vibrancy of it all. It’s hope, optimism and joy versus the promise of retribution, anger, bitterness and division. And if you look at the candidates’ schedules, it’s also the active versus the inert. You have Harris flying out of Washington on Wednesday and heading to Wisconsin, doing an event there and then going straight to Detroit. Her schedule is busy morning, noon and night.  Here’s how Donald Trump laid out his schedule for Wednesday: “I will be interviewed tomorrow morning at 7:30 A.M. on Fox & Friends. Much to talk about. ENJOY!” The truth is, whenever Trump does go out he damages his campaign. His campaign has been very straightforward and honest about that. They want to hide him. They want to keep him from going out and talking because we see what happens when he does.  He went to Georgia and basically created a political civil war inside the Georgia Republican Party — making devastating comments, not only about Gov. Brian Kemp, but the governor’s wife, which again, is the last thing he needed to do. It’s clear this is going to be a campaign of contrast."
Trump picks a nickname for Harris that no one seems to understand,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-nickname-kamala-harris-kamabla-no-one-understands-rcna165602,"It was late Monday when Donald Trump first referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Kamabla” on his social media platform. Soon after, the former president repeated the nickname. A day later, the Republican wrote it again. And then again. And then again. And then again. At this point, readers might be asking, “What in the world does ‘Kamabla’ actually mean?” That’s certainly a common question this week, and no one seems to know the answer. That includes Team Trump surrogates. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Gov. Doug Burgum last night, “This is something I’m personally curious about. ... Do you know where [‘Kamabla’] came from, and what that nickname means?” The North Dakota Republican replied, “I can’t comment on that.” On Wednesday afternoon, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, was asked the same question. The Ohio Republican chuckled, but he didn’t answer the question. The mystery, in other words, lingers. I’ve seen a wide variety of guesses — the idea that this might be some kind of Three Dog Night reference is especially amusing — and it’s certainly possible that Trump didn’t even mean to call her “Kamabla,” but once he did, he decided to lean into the typo. But there’s also a larger context to all of this. As a New York Times report summarized: This is compelling, and coming up with a weird, gibberish-like nickname might very well have something to do with the GOP nominee’s desire to define Harris as The Other. But the whole point of derisive nicknames is to convey an obvious criticism. When Trump called Sen. Marco Rubio “Little Marco,” the phrase was intended to diminish the Floridian’s stature. When he called Sen. Ted Cruz “Lying Ted,” Trump was trying to draw attention to the Texan’s dishonesty. The meaning and purpose of the nicknames were self-evident. No one thought to wonder why in the world Trump was using these lines. The fact that the former president’s own surrogates can’t explain his sudden fixation on “Kamabla” is a timely reminder of a politician who clearly no longer has his fastball."
Harris plays it safe with Walz pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-choice-tim-walz-vp-anti-trump-republicans-rcna165596,"While it might seem lifetime ago, it’s been just over two weeks since President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris. Knowing she would be running against the clock, with a very compressed campaign schedule, Harris quickly jumped into action. In the first week, she reached out to party leaders and raised a lot of money very quickly. Then came the much tougher — and significant — task of picking a running mate. A good running mate should strengthen a ticket’s chances in key states, help win over a certain block of voters and share a policy agenda with their presidential nominee. By picking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris has opted for compatibility and a more left-leaning policy agenda. But I know for a fact that a lot of moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents are less than thrilled about it. Immediately after the Walz announcement, my phone exploded with friends, family and colleagues all saying basically the same thing: ""I was excited about Harris, and I’m still going to vote for her, but only as a vote against Trump."" In other words, this choice may not push anti-Trumpers back into the MAGA fold, but it is very disappointing. Some of the sparkle and promise is now gone. During the last couple of weeks there was a palpable buzz among moderates especially. Biden stepped down, Harris stepped up, and both Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were being floated as possible running mates. Shapiro, has been working with a Republican-controlled state Senate to get things done in Pennsylvania, and Kelly most recently supported bipartisan immigration reform legislation, an issue he has publicly disagree with his own party on. What was so appealing to moderates about these men is that they are consensus-builders; they have worked with Republicans and picking either of them would prove that Harris wasn’t going to be the progressive candidate that they feared. Polling strongly suggests that most people do not vote for a president based on their vice presidential pick. However, this decision does give voters a glimpse of what kind of leader the candidate would be if elected, and how they might govern. As governor, Walz has successfully pushed a progressive legislative agenda in his home state, and this agenda will now be used by Republicans to frame Harris as a “San Francisco Liberal.” Among the issues that Republicans will certainly try to exploit are Walz’s push to allow undocumented migrants to be eligible for driver licenses, his restoration of voting rights for felons and his passage of tough climate change regulations. A glowing endorsement from Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez will not help matters with swing voters. Although, to be fair, moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin also supports the choice. I was a senior adviser to The Lincoln Project and oversaw the day-to-day operations of Republicans and Independents for Biden. This coalition, along with other like-minded organizations, helped persuade moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents to vote for Biden, which in turn helped Biden over the finish line in 2020. So I know a fair amount about how to appeal to the sort of Republican who is desperately seeking a Trump alternative. By putting Walz on the ticket, it appears that the Harris campaign is betting that the people who voted for Trump in 2016, then flipped and voted for Biden in 2020, will either grimace and vote for Harris anyway, or just sit this election out. (And this may very well be true.) It also shows that Team Harris must still be at least a little worried about the liberal base, especially the “uncommitted” voters turned off by Biden’s support for Israel. It is likely that after the Democratic National Convention in a couple of weeks, we won’t see or hear much about Gov. Walz. It is also likely that Walz will not cause the headaches that Ohio Sen. JD Vance is already inflicting on the Trump ticket. Still, Walz is far from the bold choice that swing voters were looking for. We had hoped for better."
"Pressed on Ten Commandments displays, Louisiana governor gives bad advice",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-ten-commandments-displays-louisiana-gov-gives-bad-advice-rcna165571,"Gov. Jeff Landry seems to realize that he’s created a controversy by requiring every public school classroom in the state to promote the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments. But the Louisiana Republican told reporters earlier this week, “I don’t see what the whole big fuss is about.” As NBC News reported, the first-year governor also had some related advice for families who prefer religiously-neutral public education: Whether the Louisiana Republican is aware of this or not, this is a familiar argument with an unfortunate history. Before U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the middle of the 20th century protecting the separation of church and state, it was common in many parts of the country for public schools to promote religious symbols, practices and prayers. If students and their families weren’t part of the local majority on matters of faith, they heard advice similar to what Landry offered this week. You’re part of a Jewish family in a public school that promotes Christianity? Tell your child to go wait in the hall while the rest of the class recites a Christian prayer. You’re a Catholic student in a school promoting the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments? Your parents can simply tell you to avert your eyes as the state government promotes its preferred sacred text. The far-right governor may be confused about “the whole big fuss,” but in the United States, there’s no reason to turn back the clock to an era in which public officials intervened in children’s religious upbringing, communities fought over whose religion would be favored, and kids from minority traditions were told to tolerate being treated as second-class students. The underlying principle couldn’t be simpler: It’s not the job of politicians in state government to endorse and promote the tenets of a preferred religion. Schools can and should remain neutral on matters of faith. Why Landry and his cohorts would want government officials to interfere in matters better left to families remains something of a mystery. When the Republican first created this law in June, requiring Decalogue displays in all public classrooms — from kindergarten to state-funded universities — Landry declared, “If you want to respect the rule of law, you’ve got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.” In reality, of course, if Louisiana Republicans want to respect the rule of law, they have to start with their own country’s Constitution, which includes the First Amendment, and to honor U.S. Supreme Court precedent, which GOP officials in the state have decided to ignore. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Assault weapons ruling raises possible Supreme Court guns test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 9:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/maryland-assault-weapons-ban-supreme-court-rcna165524,"The Supreme Court declined to further expand gun rights this past term in the Rahimi case, when a lopsided majority (over Justice Clarence Thomas’ dissent) upheld firearms restrictions for people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. But a new federal appeals court ruling on assault weapons could prompt another test for the justices. In that ruling on Tuesday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved Maryland’s assault weapons ban. The appeals court said the state “was well within its constitutional prerogative to legislate as it did,” despite the Supreme Court’s gun rights expansion in the 2022 Bruen ruling. The high court's Republican-appointed majority said in that decision that gun regulations can only survive Second Amendment challenges if they’re consistent with the nation’s historical traditions. “We conclude that Bruen did not mandate an abandonment of our faith in self-governance, nor did it leave the balance struck throughout our history of firearms regulation behind,” Reagan-appointed Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote for the 4th Circuit majority on Tuesday, noting that “it would have been shocking to the Framers to witness the mass shootings of our day”: “These are not our forebears’ arms, and these are not our forebears’ calamities,” Wilkinson wrote. Given that the challengers have vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court, it’s important to consider the 4th Circuit dissent, authored by Trump appointee Julius Richardson. In a lengthy writing, Richardson accused the majority of sidestepping the Second Amendment, demeaning weapons’ lawful functions and exaggerating their unlawful uses, and implausibly analyzing the nation’s historical tradition of firearms regulation. Obviously, the two opinions tell different stories with different priorities. The forthcoming Supreme Court appeal will seek to harness Richardson’s dissent to make it the law of the land. The high court has discretion over whether to take appeals, with four justices needing to agree to review them. So the first question will be whether the court wants to take up the contentious issue — and if it does, then the question, left open in the Rahimi case, will be how far a majority of the court wants to take the Second Amendment.

Cori Bush, a progressive Democrat and one of Congress' most vocal critics of Israel’s policies toward Palestinians and its assaults on the Gaza Strip, lost her primary Tuesday night after a pro-Israel group spent millions attacking her and boosting her opponent, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell. Bush, who was seeking a third term for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, is the second of the progressive “squad” lawmakers in the House to lose a primary after pro-Israel groups poured money into their races. More than $18 million was spent in Bush's primary, almost $9 million of which came from the United Democracy Project, a super PAC affiliated with the pro-Israel group AIPAC. Earlier this week, Bush expressed her discontent with the outsize spending by external groups. “I’m just trying to make sense of why so much money would be spent in our congressional race when our district has so many needs,” she told NBC News. In June, Rep. Jamaal Bowman also lost his New York primary to a moderate opponent backed by the United Democracy Project to the tune of almost $15 million. (My colleague Zeeshan Aleem wrote that Bowman had glaring vulnerabilities as a candidate, which the UDP successfully spotlighted.) Bush’s race was the second-most expensive primary of the cycle, behind Bowman’s. Bell will likely carry the deep-blue district in the general election. The prosecutor, who was initially running for Missouri's seat in the U.S. Senate, abandoned that campaign in October to mount a primary challenge against Bush. On the campaign trail, he sought to draw a contrast between Bush's position and his pro-Israel stance, and he pointed to her vote against the Biden infrastructure bill as an example of her failure to deliver results for her constituents. Bush's ""no"" vote on the bill was part of a pressure campaign to expand the child tax credit and a slew of other programs in the bill that she said would benefit low-income families in her district. Bush was also attacked over a Justice Department investigation into her use of campaign funds; she has denied wrongdoing and said she is cooperating with the probe. Bush suggested that she won't be leaving politics just yet. In her interview with NBC News this week, she pointed to her previous unsuccessful runs for Congress, saying, “One thing I don’t do is go away.”"
"In new suit, Musk’s X accuses advertisers of boycotting platform after Twitter takeover",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-suit-musks-x-accuses-advertisers-boycotting-platform-twitter-takeo-rcna165550,"Elon Musk’s social media platform filed a curious federal lawsuit yesterday, targeting a group of advertisers for allegedly organizing a boycott of the company formerly known as Twitter. NBC News reported: As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the conspiratorial billionaire also declared “war” against a coalition of advertisers known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). There are legal experts who can speak to this with more authority than I can, but from a layperson’s perspective, the litigation seems rather odd. People are free to ask advertisers not to support a media company. Advertisers are similarly free to buy space, or not, on the platforms of their choosing. For a social media company to sue private entities for choosing not to give it money seems like a tough sell. But as the case advances, there was one detail in the reporting that deserves a closer look. Reuters noted, “The case was filed in the Northern District of Texas and assigned to U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor.” And who is Judge Reed O’Connor? I’m glad you asked. The week before Christmas in 2018, for example, it was O’Connor who agreed to strike down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, root and branch. Even many conservatives and ACA critics agreed that the ruling was indefensible, and reactions tended to include words and phrases such as “pretty bananas,” “embarrassingly bad” and “absurd.” The New York Times noted soon after that Republicans had a habit of bringing their cases to this specific district court because of their confidence that O’Connor would give them everything they wanted: “He ruled for Texas in 2015 when it challenged an Obama administration measure extending family leave benefits to married same-sex couples. ... He also ruled for Texas in 2016, blocking the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines expanding restroom access for transgender students.” In 2022, the same judge, nominated by George W. Bush, also undermined the Navy’s vaccine requirements, ignoring generations’ worth of precedent. A year later, O’Connor took steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act again. Last month, O’Connor made headlines again, this time by blocking President Joe Biden’s administration from enforcing new anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students. It’s against this backdrop that the lawyers for Musk’s platform filed their new case in a specific Texas district where they knew the case would almost certainly be assigned to O’Connor. The tactic goes by different names. I’ve seen it referred to as “forum shopping,” “judge shopping,” “venue shopping,” and “court shopping,” but the phrases all mean the same thing: Instead of simply taking one’s chances in the judiciary, many litigants effectively try to hand-pick ideologically aligned jurists, filing their cases in specific districts in the hopes of guaranteeing success before the process even begins in earnest. I don’t know for certain whether X’s legal team tried to game the system, but it seems like quite a coincidence that they took their case to a judge who’s notorious for telling the right what it wants to hear.

Arizona’s fake electors scandal intensifies in unexpected ways,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 7:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizonas-fake-electors-scandal-intensifies-unexpected-ways-rcna165536,"In April, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes advanced the larger fake electors scandal in dramatic fashion: The Democrat worked with a grand jury to indict 18 people: 11 fake electors and seven Donald Trump aides. Nearly four months later, the larger case is advancing in some unexpected directions. On Monday, for example, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis flipped and signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, who in turn agreed to drop the pending criminal charges against her. The good news for Ellis was that she no longer had to worry about ending up behind bars, while the good news for prosecutors was that they suddenly had a cooperating witness with key insights to share about the underlying scheme. But as we discussed soon after, the question then became whether others might soon follow Ellis’ lead. Evidently, we didn’t have to wait too long for an answer. Politico reported: While the fake electors scandal has generated several dozen indictments across multiple states — a total unseen in a political scandal since the days of Watergate or Iran-Contra — the Politico report noted that Pellegrino “is the first participant in the elector scheme to accept criminal responsibility for signing the false documents.” And as dramatic a development as this is, it turns out there’s a related revelation from the same investigation that’s also raised some eyebrows. The Washington Post reported: Oh. So if this report, which hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, is correct, the former president would be facing five criminal indictments — instead of four — if members of an Arizona grand jury had their way. For those who’ve been watching this case closely, the reporting is striking, though it’s not altogether surprising. A couple of weeks after the indictments in Arizona’s fake electors case were issued, Politico reported that the grand jury’s members were “unusually aggressive” and were prepared to “cast a far wider net than state prosecutors had publicly foreshadowed.” In fact, local prosecutors weren’t inclined to indict Ellis and Republican lawyer Christina Bobb, but “the grand jury indicted them anyway.” In the indictment that reached the public in April, Trump was described as “Unindicted Coconspirator 1.” If the Post’s reporting is accurate, at least some of the grand jury was inclined to go even further."
FBI seizes GOP Rep. Andy Ogles’ phone as part of ongoing probe,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 6:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-seizes-gop-rep-andy-ogles-phone-part-ongoing-probe-rcna165527,"Last week was rather eventful for far-right Rep. Andy Ogles. On Thursday, for example, the Tennessee Republican fended off a well-funded primary challenger, leaving the incumbent well positioned to win a second term in the fall. A day later, the FBI stopped by the congressman’s home for a visit. The New York Times reported: The news was first reported by WTVF, the CBS affiliate in Nashville. While the reporting hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the congressman’s lawyer has confirmed that the FBI obtained a search warrant for Ogles’ phone, and the GOP lawmaker cooperated. The lawyer also told the Times that “it was his understanding that the search was related to allegations of financial improprieties.” For his part, the congressman himself issued a brief statement by way of social media, which read, “It has been widely reported for months that my campaign made mistakes in our initial financial filings. We have worked diligently with attorneys and reporting experts to correct the errors and ensure compliance going forward. Last Friday, the FBI took possession of my cell phone.” As regular readers know, this controversy has been percolating for several months. In fact, it was last fall when WTVF in Tennessee reported that Ogles’ finance reports showed that he’d made a $320,000 personal loan to his campaign. That was difficult to believe, since the congressman’s financial disclosures suggested he didn’t have $320,000. In May, Ogles effectively conceded that his earlier claims weren’t true. In fact, the House Freedom Caucus member filed amendments to his campaign finance reports, telling the Federal Election Commission that he actually loaned his campaign $20,000, instead of the $320,000. This, of course, led to some fairly obvious questions about the possible sources of the other $300,000. Complicating matters is that Ogles doesn’t exactly have a reservoir of credibility to draw from as he faces an FBI probe. On the contrary, he has a staggering pattern of deceptions. Indeed, Ogles is starting to resemble another House Republican who was caught lying about his background and facing FBI scrutiny over his controversial finances. His name was former Rep. George Santos. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Increasingly desperate, Trump wants Biden to return to 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/desperate-donald-trump-wants-joe-biden-return-2024-race-election-rcna165508,"As of a few weeks ago, Donald Trump was feeling quite good about the state of the 2024 presidential race. The former president was ahead in the polls; Democrats were divided; President Joe Biden was struggling; and much of the national analysis was about the expanding electoral map, as traditional “blue” states started to appear more competitive. The Republican had reason to be pleased: He was winning. Indeed, Trump’s assumptions about his inevitable victory contributed to his decision to pick an unpopular far-right running mate: As the GOP nominee saw it, he could get away with adding Sen. JD Vance to the ticket — as opposed to a qualified candidate with broader electoral appeal — because the race was effectively over. That is, until it wasn’t. Biden’s decision to pass the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris has done exactly what many Democrats expected: It overhauled the 2024 contest and put the party in a better position to win. The shift has made Trump increasingly hysterical. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico this week. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” In fact, it’s reached the point at which Trump seems to be trying to coax Biden to re-enter the race and return things to how they were when the former president was still happy. Within a few hours of Harris adding Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to the Democratic ticket, the Republican claimed by way of his social media platform, “I HEAR THERE IS A BIG MOVEMENT TO ‘BRING BACK CROOKED JOE.’” For those who pay close attention to Trump’s rhetoric, “I hear” is one of those things he says when he’s making stuff up. It’s effectively the same thing as manufactured anecdotes about big guys crying while calling him, “Sir.” About a half-hour later, the GOP candidate nevertheless published a follow-up item, pondering the possibility that Biden might “crash” the Democratic National Convention in order to “take back the Nomination.” Trump added: So, a few things. First, if anyone should avoid references to “coups,” it’s Trump. Second, the idea that Trump is privy to Biden’s private thoughts is kind of hilarious. Third, there is literally no reason to believe the incumbent president, who’s already endorsed Harris, has any interest in reversing his retirement decision, and the vice president has already secured the party’s 2024 nomination. But let’s not miss the forest for the trees: To get a sense of the Republican’s current assessment of the 2024 race, look no further than his silly efforts to get Biden to jump back into the contest, and put things back the way they were when he was still happy. A confident candidate, optimistic about the campaign’s direction, wouldn’t push such obvious nonsense. A panicking candidate, however, would. New York’s Jon Chait added, “Many of Trump’s strange public utterances have some animalistic logic to them. Whatever their lack of connection to truth, he displays dominance or caters to the desires of his audience. Here Trump is doing neither. He is fantasizing that the opponent currently tormenting him, and whom he is afraid to debate, will somehow disappear and the opponent he was defeating will somehow return.” Quite right. Whenever he’s in a jam with no obvious solution, one of Trump’s instincts is to look for someone who can make his problem go away. In this instance, he’s settled on, of all people, Biden. It’s rare to see such a pitiful display of desperation."
Glenn Youngkin downplays Trump’s mass firing plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 5:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/glenn-youngkin-trump-mass-firing-project-2025-rcna165470,"Polls show Americans are broadly worried, if not disgusted, by the idea of Project 2025, a detailed plan drafted largely by members of Donald Trump’s administration, which would fill the government with Trump loyalists and enforce draconian policies if he’s elected.  Even though the MAGA DNA in Project 2025 is clear, Trump and his campaign have publicly tried to distance themselves from it — a sign of its political toxicity. But one person who’s oddly calm about the potential damage Project 2025 could do to his state? Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. To enact Project 2025, Trump loyalists have discussed reviving an executive order he tried to enact in 2020, known as “Schedule F,” which would have stripped federal civil servants of their protections and allowed Trump to fire people for whatever reason. For the more than 140,000 federal employees who work in Virginia, such a move could have devastating implications.  But Youngkin suggested federal workers in his state would be just fine even if they are purged from their positions for political reasons or if a second Trump administration relocates entire agencies, as Trump did with varying success during his first term. According to WVTF public radio:  In a campaign video this year, Trump said, “As many as 100,000 government positions could be moved out, and I mean immediately, of Washington to places filled with patriots.” But for Youngkin to tell hundreds of thousands of federal employees, many of whom may have been working in their positions for years, that they could easily transition into these “fabulous” jobs sounds beyond naive — if not downright callous. And Virginia Democrats were quick to pounce on Youngkin for the remarks.  Virginia's governor has managed to pitch himself as a centrist and gets portrayed as a rising Republican star. But his remarks here highlight one glaring flaw: Though he can seem genial in person, that persona often feels like a cover for cruel and draconian policies."
The biggest difference between Tim Walz and JD Vance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-rural-voters-rcna165344,"“The vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” former President Donald Trump said during his disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists last week. Trump certainly hopes that bit of conventional wisdom holds true this year. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has turned out to be an unusually poor candidate by almost any criterion, to the point where Trump can’t even bring himself to say Vance is ready to be president. The story on the other side is far different. We don’t yet know how Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will perform as he moves into the national spotlight. But in addition to putting his state out of reach, Walz could start undoing the Democratic Party’s weakness with precisely the people Vance was supposed to represent: rural voters, especially rural white voters. Only about 20% of Americans live in what the Census Bureau classifies as rural areas; most of us live in cities and suburbs. But the Republican Party’s power is built on rural votes, not only through its dominance of small rural states but by virtue of its strong support in rural areas within states, including every battleground state. As recently as Bill Clinton’s presidency, rural voters were roughly split between the parties. That’s changed in the last couple decades. Trump — a son of Queens who couldn’t have less life experience in common with the average rural resident — remains popular with rural Americans. He won 65% of rural votes in 2020 — and 71% of rural whites, up from 62% in 2016. In 2022, rural whites gave 74% of their votes to Republican House candidates, up from 64% four years before. There are many reasons for this partisan gap, but the most important is that rural whites have become convinced that Democrats aren’t like them and don’t respect them. Some would say this is all Democrats’ fault, but that ignores the relentless campaign by Republicans and the conservative media to persuade rural whites that Democrats are a bunch of snooty coastal elitists who want nothing more than to destroy rural America and everything it represents. However you apportion responsibility, the fact that Democrats are at a deep disadvantage in rural America remains. It would be lovely if Democrats could simply point out that the Biden administration has aggressively directed money to rural areas for a broad range of needs, from economic development to clean energy to broadband to infrastructure. But alas, that’s not how politics works. Democrats need messengers who can get past the skepticism — or even hostility — that so many in rural America have toward their party. Which is where Walz comes in. “He knows how to speak our language,” says Matt Hildreth, executive director of Rural Organizing, “and understands that we want elected officials who have our backs.” In the House, Walz was one of the few Democrats who won in districts Trump won handily. Not only did he grow up in rural Nebraska, as Trump might say, he is straight from central casting for the role of “Midwestern Dad.” Try to imagine Donald Trump looking happy holding a piglet. Walz also has another skill: a talent for presenting complex issues in terms that are straightforward and easy to understand. This is something that Democratic leaders, who love nothing more than a detailed policy discussion, have often lacked. He has as strong a liberal record as any governor in the country, but you’d also be hard-pressed to find a Democrat who could win more converts at an agricultural fair. The way for Democrats to regain lost ground in rural areas, Walz told Ezra Klein of The New York Times, “is with optimism and a sense of grace toward folks.” But he isn’t afraid to make a strong case against Republicans; he can stick in a shiv and do it with a smile. He is deft at dishing out strong criticism of his opponents without sounding mean or condescending. Which is exactly what Democrats need in rural areas. It isn’t enough to tell rural voters that the party they’ve been rejecting has something to offer them; they also have to be convinced that they’ve been betrayed by a GOP that offered them nothing but culture war provocation and resentment. And the truth is that the fact that Walz still looks like the football coach he once was means people are less likely to perceive him as unusually liberal. If nothing else, Walz can at least begin to change the conversation around rural politics, to force Republicans to answer for their neglect of rural America. If he can persuade rural voters to start asking the Republicans who represent them up and down the ballot, “What have you done for us lately?” it would create the conditions for some long-overdue political competition in rural America. That would help Democrats, and it would help rural people, too. For too long, they’ve been getting nothing in return for their votes. If Tim Walz can show them a different path, everybody wins. Except Donald Trump."
Trump can’t take a joke. Democrats need to use that.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jd-vance-tim-walz-weird-maga-authoritarians-rcna164669,"It’s the summer of weird Republicans. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly mentions Hannibal Lecter at his rallies, speaking about the fictional cannibal as though he were a real person. “He’s a lovely man. He’d love to have you for dinner,” must be one of the strangest things a candidate has said while trying to attract votes. Meanwhile, Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has made news with his bizarre opinions, including a 2021 remark that Americans with children should be able to vote more times in an election than their childless compatriots. Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate for president who met with Trump to discuss the possibility of dropping out of the race, admitted to dumping a bear carcass in Central Park a decade ago. (“We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,” he claimed.) “These guys are just weird,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said last week on “Morning Joe.” That label has stuck ever since, to the right’s frustration and fury. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has seized the messaging advantages of “weird,” and on Tuesday she even named Walz to the ticket. For scholars of authoritarianism, the success of “weird” is no surprise. That’s because humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics. Behind the facade of their omnipotence, most strongmen are brittle and insecure personalities. They don’t mind being called evil, but being ridiculed is a different matter. When fringe beliefs become mainstream, it’s easy to accept a political environment where the surreal and the extreme are everyday affairs. That’s how we get to Fox News host Jesse Watters telling viewers that “scientists” believe that “when a man votes for a woman, he actually transitions into a woman.” The misogyny and transgender phobia that may have inspired this proclamation are no joke, but the opportunity for satire at the ridiculous statement should not be missed. Strongmen have their own sadistic sense of humor, which is amply displayed in the awful authoritarian spectacles staged by their governments. The Nazis enjoyed making Communists who entered Dachau concentration camp in 1933, like Hans Beimler, wear signs that said “A hearty welcome!” But they cannot take a joke when they are the targets. That’s why they have to surround themselves with sycophants and lackeys, and their enablers know their prestige must be policed. When a man brought his pet rabbit named Mussolini to a bar in fascist Italy, thinking others would enjoy seeing him order it around, he was quickly arrested and served a year in confinement. Chilean graphic artist Guillo Bastías discovered the price of puncturing the leader’s personality cult with humor when the magazine Apsi published his caricature of dictator Augusto Pinochet as Louis XIV in 1987. The regime sent the magazine’s editors to jail for “extremism”: That’s how threatening humor can be as a truth-telling vehicle, in this case about how Pinochet saw the scope of his power. Satire shifts our perception of things and people, helping us to see them in a new light that is often unflattering to them. And it reminds us that what we are living through is out of the ordinary. As Bastías told me in 2018, he wanted to reassure Chileans suffering under the dictatorship that there were people who were “refusing to accept the disinformation and lies … refusing to accept the abnormal as normal.” And so we are back to “weird” as a strategy of disruption, and how thankful we can be that our democratic rights afford us freedom of speech to level such critiques at the powerful without fear of detention or worse. That is how artist Robin Bell was able to stage his projections on the front of Trump International Hotel, like a May 2017 work that read “Pay Trump Bribes Here.” While Bell worked in very different circumstances than Guillo, he, too, saw his work as a way of reminding people that “what we are experiencing is not normal.” Humor can have a crucial role in the work of mobilization and civic education to keep those democratic rights. “Laughtivism,” as Serbian democracy activist Srdja Popovic has called it, views humor as more effective than anger in highly polarized situations. When we laugh together, fear and distrust lessen, which is the opposite of what authoritarians want. That, too, is why such leaders can’t take a joke. "
Vontelle eyewear founders on why ‘your network is your net worth’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 5:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/vontelle-eyewear-founders-network-net-rcna165331,"For New York-based entrepreneurs, Nancey Harris and Tracy Green, a call from the “The Kelly Clarkson Show” resulted in a surprise trip of a lifetime that took their business to new heights.  In early 2023, the best friends and founders of Vontelle eyewear, appeared on the show to talk about their innovative eyewear company. Unbeknownst to them, “Morning Joe” co-host and Know Your Value founder, Mika Brzezinski would surprise them live on air with an invitation and tickets to join Forbes and Know Your Value’s 30/50 Summit in Abu Dhabi.   Since then, their brand has grown exponentially, and their glasses can be found in hundreds of stores across the country — from Walmart to Saks Fifth Avenue. The founders — who are both over 50 — were also recently honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list. “We are beyond thrilled,” Green said about making the list, saying it proves that “age is just a number. At every age, you can bring value and experience to the world.” Harris and Green said it was Forbes and Know Your Value’s four-day summit in Abu Dhabi -- and the networking opportunities with some of the world’s most powerful women -- that really changed the trajectory of their business. During the conference, Harris and Green found themselves sharing a cab with a fellow attendee. “This person and I begin a whole conversation. The next thing we know, we tell her about our glasses,” Harris explained. The attendee, who happened to be an angel investor, bonded with the women over their shared experience having trouble finding glasses that fit. Before they knew it, they became one of the founders’ first angel investors, which allowed them to make an important distribution deal with America’s Best — one of the country’s leading eyewear retailers. “If we didn’t have that money from the angel investor, it would have been tougher for us to actually get this opportunity and be successful,” said Green. “It really helped us be able to be a part of this industry in a real way.” Vontelle became the first Black women-owned eyewear company to partner with the optical retail giant. Their product is now sold in over 900 America’s Best stores nationwide. Their journey started almost five years ago, when they saw an opportunity to solve a big gap in the eyewear industry. “In 2019 I lost a pair of glasses. And I was frustrated when I went to look for a replacement pair. They all looked the same but most importantly, they were all too tight.” Green explained. “I have kind of chubby cheeks.. and they were never long enough…and when you’re frustrated what do you do you? Call your best friend to complain. I called Nancy to complain.” The two friends got to work. As they researched the eyewear industry, they found that there was hardly any diverse representation from eyewear makers. “We realized that the reason why glasses hurt for so many of our friends and family and ourselves and leaves lines on your face, and cheek indentations, is because no one who looks like us is making glasses for us. And here we are now, five years later,” Green said. The Brooklyn based eyewear company, whose vibrant designs are inspired by the African Diaspora, are made to fit diverse face shapes. Since then, the former sales and finance professionals have managed to secure ongoing partnerships with brands like Fivver and inked an exclusive licensing deal to create kid-friendly glasses for Nickelodeon. They’ve even partnered up with entertainers like actor Kadeem Hardison, to create a patent pending design of flip up glasses, inspired by his role on the show, “A Different World.” Both Green and Harris credit their success and growth on their ability to build intentional business relationships over time, and advise aspiring founders to do the same.  “Continue to network. And a ‘no’ may just be a delay to ‘yes’ later on,” said Harris. “Because people go to different brands all the time. And then or there’s turnover in companies so just keep going because one person may not have liked it, but the new person that comes on board may love it. So you just never know what somebody’s appetite may be at that particular time. And just remember your network is your net worth. It’s very powerful.” Daniela Pierre-Bravo is a journalist, author, and founder of Acceso Community — a mentorship program for professional women. She is the co-author of “Earn It” with Mika Brzezinski. Her solo book, “’The Other: How to Own Your Power at Work as a Woman of Color,” is out now.

The U.S. can’t figure out how to actually help Venezuela’s opposition,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 4:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/venezuela-election-us-policy-reaction-rcna165448,"More than a week after millions of Venezuelans went to the polls to pick their new president, the autocrat Nicolás Maduro remains ensconced in the Miraflores presidential palace, despite evidence that he lost the election to his opponent Edmundo González. Shortly after the voting ended, the government-dominated National Electoral Council (NEC) announced that Maduro was the winner and that he had beat opposition candidate González by seven percentage points. The only problem: the NEC has yet to release any of the detailed data to the public in what is shaping up to be the most transparent election fraud in the history of Latin America. Maduro’s political opponents were able to acquire more than 80% of the vote tally sheets from the thousands of polling stations dotting the country. Those numbers paint a strikingly different picture, showing González demolishing Maduro by an astounding 35 percentage points. The Washington Post did its own calculations and found that, of the 23,270 tally sheets received from the opposition, González won with about 67% of the vote to Maduro’s paltry 30%. The numbers were so lopsided that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement on Aug. 1 declaring Gonzalez the indisputable victor: “Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people, that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s July 28 presidential election.” The Americans weren’t the only ones — the European Union, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Panama and others have either questioned the results given by Maduro’s administration or called Venezuela’s latest election a sham. Now, U.S. policymakers are likely asking themselves some big questions. Can Maduro be pushed out, and if so, how and at what price? If not, is there a way to at least convince Maduro to establish a national unity government? Should Washington step aside and allow Latin America’s heavyweights like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia to take ownership of the issue? And is the stream of migration out of Venezuela — nearly 8 million have left over the last decade — bound to get worse?    Maduro, who has ruled Venezuela since 2013 after taking over from his mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, is no stranger to election shenanigans. The 2013 and 2018 presidential elections as well as the 2017 constituent assembly elections were all viewed in one way or another as laced with fraud or skewed to the government’s favor. Maduro has used the machinery of government to ice out opposition candidates, barring some from public life while arresting others. Popular opposition figure Maria Corina Machado was banned from running this year, forcing her to name a replacement in Gonzalez, a mild-mannered former diplomat who had virtually no national name recognition.  In the days since the election, Maduro hasn’t wavered. He held a giant rally over the weekend to brag about his victory. He blasted his opponents as fascists, criminals, coup-plotters and lackeys of the great imperial beast to the north, the United States. He’s done more than talk: approximately 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested so far; Venezuelan diplomats from seven Latin American countries who disputed Maduro’s victory were ordered back to Caracas; direct flights to Panama, the Dominican Republic and Peru were cancelled; and Maduro has called on ordinary Venezuelans to use a government-built app to report anti-government protests.  None of this is surprising. We knew, for instance, that Maduro would use all of the power at his disposal to extend his presidency for another six years. We knew the Venezuelan opposition movement would react harshly to yet another stolen election. We knew Washington and its allies and partners in Europe and Latin America would raise concerns about the voting procedures. And we even knew that Maduro would have a very tough chance winning a third term in a free and open election.  What we don’t know, however, is whether the U.S. can do anything to dislodge Maduro from power or whether any policy from Washington would fix the situation Venezuela currently finds itself in. The answer if recent history is any guide would appear to be “no.” For the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, Maduro’s Venezuela is the very definition of an intractable foreign policy problem with no clear-cut solutions. Everything the U.S. has tried over the last decade has failed. U.S. policy took a slightly more hawkish turn under Obama, who despite shaking hands with Chavez during an April 2009 regional summit — Chavez famously said he wanted to be friends with Obama — found the Venezuelan socialist as ornery during his term as he was during his predecessor George W. Bush’s. In 2010, Washington revoked the visa of Venezuela’s ambassador in retaliation for Caracas refusing to accept Obama’s ambassadorial nominee to the country. It only took a turn for the worst when Maduro, who succeeded Chavez after his death from cancer, took a heavy hand against demonstrators and pro-democracy advocates during protests in 2015, stripped opposition lawmakers from their committee posts and kicked out a foreign cable news network. Sanctions soon became the core tool of U.S. policy on Venezuela, with Congress passing a sanctions law in 2014 and Obama issuing an executive order months later to freeze the assets of any Venezuelan official complicit in acts of violence against civilians, restrictions on freedom of the press and public corruption. The actions were at best symbolic, a way to show Latin America that Washington was doing something. The sanctions regime accelerated rapidly under former President Donald Trump, when U.S.-Venezuela relations were in purgatory for Trump’s four years in office. Washington prevented U.S. oil companies from operating in Venezuela or selling Venezuelan oil. Any third-party country who imported Venezuelan oil, the lifeblood of Maduro’s economy, exposed themselves to being locked out of the U.S. financial system. Venezuelan government property and assets in the U.S. were seized and handed over to Juan Guaido, the leader of the National Assembly whom the Trump administration and dozens of other countries recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state in January 2019. Between 2015 and 2020, Venezuela’s oil exports declined by approximately 80%, from 2.4 million barrels a day to 500,000 barrels a day.  This maximum-pressure policy was trumpeted by U.S. officials whose braggadocio and confidence would ultimately prove short-lived. Former national security adviser John Bolton (who claimed that the sanctions would end “Maduro’s tyrannical reign”) and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (who asserted Maduro’s government was on its last legs) would later attempt to explain why they were both wrong (they still haven’t been able to). So did Guaido, whose attempted uprising against Maduro’s government in April 2019 unraveled in a day after the Venezuelan military stuck with Maduro. The Venezuelan people were the ultimate losers in this situation, forced to live with a cratering economy hemmed in by U.S. sanctions, an ever-repressive Venezuelan security apparatus and a man in Maduro whose power at the top of the system was more consolidated than ever before. Biden came into office in 2021 knowing Trump’s maximum pressure strategy was a failure. Yet he didn’t ditch it entirely. Rather, he tailored the pressure with backchannel diplomacy in the hope that offers of U.S. financial relief would incentivize Caracas to meet U.S. demands. In October 2022, the U.S. and Venezuela struck a prisoner exchange, trading two nephews of Maduro’s wife (who were convicted in a U.S. court on drug trafficking charges) for seven Americans imprisoned in Venezuela. Weeks later, U.S. oil company Chevron was allowed to expand production in Venezuela in an effort to keep the political dialogue between Maduro and the opposition afloat. And a year later, Washington temporarily eased sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry after Maduro signed an accord with the opposition setting some rules of the game for a free and fair upcoming presidential election. The idea: to sweeten Maduro’s appetite and give him a sample of the economic goodies on offer if he stopped jailing his opponents and rigging elections. Of course, this strategy didn’t work either. Washington re-imposed the oil sanctions in April, a consequence of ex-communicating Machado from political office for the next 15 years, preventing the European Union’s election monitors from entering the country and monopolizing coverage on the airways. The free and fair election the U.S. and Venezuela’s neighbors hoped for was anything but.  How will the U.S. react in the weeks and months ahead? Likely, the response is already baked-in: more sanctions, more diplomatic finger-waiving, perhaps building an international coalition to ensure the opposition survives to fight another day. Just don’t expect any of it to work. "
Musk joins Jim Jordan's war on free enterprise with new lawsuit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-lawsuit-jim-jordan-war-advertisers-rcna165447,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the seemingly all-inclusive world of technology. Elon Musk is propelling House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan’s war on private enterprise. On Tuesday, Musk announced a lawsuit and, in a post on X, declared ""war"" against a coalition of advertisers known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), which uses its collective power to prioritize investing in companies that align with what they feel are issues of import. Jordan previously used his role as Judiciary chairman to accuse companies in GARM of illegally colluding against conservatives over their choice not to advertise on some controversial conservative platforms. Musk’s lawsuit cites Jordan’s investigations, and in posts online he claimed companies could be guilty of racketeering for choosing not to advertise on X after he took over, which was a period in which advertisers fled from X due to the platform being rife with hate speech.

Talking Points Memo has a new report informing — or perhaps, in some cases, reminding — readers about Vance’s investment in Rumble, a video streaming platform known to platform far-right celebrities, extremists and conspiracy theorists.  Read more at Talking Points Memo.  Newsweek spoke to the creators behind a viral TikTok song made out of JD Vance’s previous remarks about being a “Never Trump guy.” The song, remixed to fit Petey Pablo’s 2003 song “Freek-a-Leek,” has garnered millions of listens across several TikTok videos over the last couple weeks.

A teenage girl in New York filed a lawsuit against Meta, which is Instagram and Facebook’s parent company, accusing executives at Meta of approving the use of features that they knew would make children addicted to their apps, and did so while knowingly exposing children to harmful material online.   An Instagram spokesperson said:  “These are complex issues but we will continue working with experts and listening to parents to develop new tools, features and policies that are effective and meet the needs of teens and their families.”  Read more at The Washington Post. Elon Musk and Donald Trump have both used their social media platforms to spread manipulated video of Kamala Harris over the last couple weeks, demonstrating why tech experts and Democratic lawmakers were right to raise awareness about how easily the spread of misinformation and the misuse of artificial intelligence tools could be used to manipulate voters in the upcoming election.

Multiple outlets had already discovered various security issues with the platform that exposed voters’ private information, and the ProPublica discovery found a flaw that made it easier for users of the platform to cancel other people’s voter registrations. Georgia Republicans have expanded opportunities for people to purge purportedly ineligible voters from the voter rolls, and in their rush to do so, they’ve clearly overlooked flaws in the process that could leave eligible voters disenfranchised.

"The stock market rallied, but the economy isn’t out of the woods yet",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/stock-market-federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation-rcna165210,"Though Wall Street indexes made something of a comeback Tuesday, recent days have been brutal for investors. The Dow fell more than 1,000 points Monday, following a smaller but still steep drop Friday. After hitting a record high on July 10, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 13% in less than a month. This extended drop is prompting increasing calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. And its critics have a point. The United States economy, seemingly so robust, is increasingly acting as if it’s on the precipice of an economic downturn. But the Fed, still busy fighting a battle against inflation it won well over a year ago, appears to be the last to know. The issue is less the stock market — remember, only 58% of Americans own so much as a single share — than investors’ collective wisdom about where the economy is headed. While stock market indexes have drifted lower for a few weeks, the downward trend only picked up significant speed Friday after the disappointing July jobs report. Employment growth came in at just 114,000 jobs created, well below expectations. The headline unemployment number is now 4.3%, nearly a percentage point higher than this time last year.  And for those paying attention, the jobs report wasn’t the first warning flare about the broader American economy. Most Americans’ pandemic savings ran out in March, something that hit lower-income consumers hard. Credit card delinquencies are up. Sales of McDonald’s, concert tickets and luxury goods are all faltering, suggesting flagging spending for consumers up and down the income ladder. Some recent layoff announcements have been eye-popping — last week Intel said it would cut 15,000 staffers by the end of the year — and employers feel increasingly empowered to demand remote workers return to the office. Yet the Fed is still fighting the last economic war, steadfastly refusing to cut the short-term interest rates even as inflation falls, unemployment ticks up and the economy slowly cools down. Fed Chair Jerome Powell insisted last week that inflation is still a significant threat and “we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late.” This is both wrongheaded and counterproductive. In fact, the Fed’s actions also might well be inadvertently exacerbating how we perceive inflation. Credit card interest rates are hovering near record highs, and while they aren’t included in inflation statistics, they still drain the wallets of those with revolving debt. The same is true in real estate, where high interest rates both raise the cost of monthly mortgages and reduce the supply of new homes being built, increasing housing prices.  Combine all that with the fact that Americans are still not used to the higher prices after the Covid-era inflationary surge, and it’s little wonder almost 4 in 10 Americans worry they won’t be able to pay all their bills. The question is now whether the Fed should admit it made a mistake and step in with an immediate rate cut. Wharton School professor Jeremy Siegel, best known for his bullish view of the stock market, is rarely on the same team as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. But now they are both demanding the Fed take quick emergency steps. “The jobs data is flashing red,” Warren wrote on X last week. “Powell needs to cancel his summer vacation and cut rates now — not wait 6 weeks.”  Others argue this could all be much ado about nothing and precipitous action will simply increase panic for no good reason. After all, as Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson famously observed, the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. And there are still positive economic signs. Unemployment remains low by historical standards. GDP growth is still healthy. Despite the recent stock dip, markets are up for the year, just not as up as they were three weeks ago. Moreover, there are other possible explanations for the sudden dive, including fear of a broader war in the Middle East, the popping of the artificial intelligence bubble and the impact of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates. But slowdowns and recessions don’t announce themselves. They sneak up on us — slowly but surely. The time to head a recession off is precisely when the signs are murky, and when there is still disagreement. That’s why the Fed needs to recalibrate and begin cutting rates before it is too late."
Virginia man is accused of making death threats against Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:18 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-death-threats-virginia-man-gettr-rcna165430,"A Northern Virginia man has been charged with making death threats against Kamala Harris, including in the days after she announced her run for president, federal authorities said. Frank Carillo, 66, is charged with one count of making threats against the vice president of the United States, according to the U.S. attorney’s office of the Western District of Virginia. He made his first court appearance Monday after being arrested at his Winchester home. A public defender listed in court records for Carillo did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. According to the criminal complaint, Carillo mentioned the vice president 19 times on Gettr, a right-wing social media platform, with several of the posts containing graphic descriptions of violence. Authorities said Carillo also posted violent threats against President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Phoenix-area elections official Stephen Richer — a Republican who has pushed back on election denialism. Carillo’s online posts were flagged by Richer’s Maricopa County office on July 27, and FBI agents then discovered more than 4,300 posts or replies on Gettr in which Carillo targeted public officials, according to the complaint. He also allegedly made posts threatening to kill undocumented immigrants and Muslims. Federal agents seized an AR-15 rifle, a 9 mm handgun and thousands of rounds of ammunition at Carillo’s home last week, the U.S. attorney’s office said. Violent threats against public officials have been on the rise in recent years. There were appeals for the temperature in politics to be lowered after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last month — including from the GOP presidential nominee himself — but there has been arguably little substantive change."
The Tim Walz pick is a win for economic populism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 2:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-populism-rcna165343,"Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 election. Of those who made it onto Harris’ short list, Walz seems like the sharpest choice. Walz possesses the sensibilities and accomplishments of an outspoken economic populist. It’s not only good for America when Democrats elevate economic populists to leadership positions, but it’s also an effective way to counteract the siren call of right-wing populism.  Walz’s recent legislative record as governor illustrates serious ambition for sweeping social policies designed to help ordinary Americans achieve economic freedom. In 2022 — the beginning of Walz’s second term — Democrats won a governing trifecta in Minnesota. They have used that rare opportunity to pass a remarkable list of bills based on the belief that the government is meant to serve the people. Those bills include universal free meals for schoolchildren; paid family and medical leave; free tuition to Minnesota’s public colleges for residents whose families earn less than $80,000 annually; and the biggest child tax credit in the nation. On top of this, Walz, with his signature, also enshrined the right to abortion and other reproductive health care into Minnesota law, legalized recreational marijuana, and required the state to generate all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Organized labor unions have also found much to like about Walz and his record of support for workers and unions as governor. Walz has not always been as progressive as that laundry list of policies might suggest. He made it to the governor’s mansion in 2018 in part by positioning himself as a moderate and by prevailing in the Democratic primaries over a more progressive candidate. As journalist David Perry noted for MSNBC, a lot of the recent accomplishments owe to the state’s unusual blue trifecta and effective Democratic leaders in the state House and Senate. Still, Walz deserves credit for signing those bills into law. He rightly noted in 2023 that “you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”   Before he became governor, Walz represented a rural Minnesota district in Congress and voted the way one might expect from a Democrat in red territory. He was in favor of voting for stricter screening of refugees, he took standard Democratic establishment positions on Israel policy, and once had an A rating from the Nation Rifle Association. “Walz is someone who hasn’t forged a career as a progressive or run on the left, but acts comfortable being in coalition with progressives — incl. often backing their proposals & signing them into law,” Daniel Nichanian, editor-in-chief of Bolts magazine, wrote on X. Walz’s earlier positions don’t negate his later ones. Rather, Walz demonstrates sensitivity to his constituencies and an eagerness to get things done — and clearly has some progressive instincts when opportunities present themselves.  Where Walz’s populism really shines is through, well, vibes. He grew up in rural Nebraska and likes hunting and fishing. He served in the Army National Guard for decades. He is a former social studies teacher and football coach who helped lead his team to its first state championship. He attended state schools for teaching degrees, and he is the first person on a Democratic presidential ticket since 1976 not to have attended law school. While he’s no socialist, he speaks with tremendous pride about public institutions. I was struck by how Walz recently panned Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and his allies’ animosity toward public education in an interview with The New York Times: “These guys, they talk about how evil the public schools are. For many of us, public schools were everything. That was our path. That’s the great American contribution.” While many prominent politicians seek desperately to come across as ordinary people who understand life outside elite professional urban bubbles, Walz’s life and career provide him with that knowledge organically. And Walz exudes that experience through a wholesome, happy warrior persona that has made him into a social media darling overnight. Walz’s masterstroke in the veepstakes was coining “weird” as an attack against former President Donald Trump and his extremist allies during MSNBC appearances. It has proven to be a strangely sticky thorn in the side of the GOP and serves as a rhetorical tool for denying MAGA of its claims to speak on behalf of the people. It’s been useful in dispelling the MAGA mythos and pointing out how unpopular and divisive right-wing populist doctrine is despite the everyman veneer. “Who’s asking for this crazy stuff? Who’s asking to raise the price of insulin? Who’s asking to get rid of birth control? … Who’s sitting in a bar in Racine, Wisconsin, saying, ‘You know what we really need? We need to ban “Animal Farm.”’ Nobody is!” Walz told MSNBC in July. As I’ve written before, political scientists have found that vice presidents rarely change the outcome of an election. But they’re significant because they’re the first major clue about how a presidential candidate seeks to govern. In this case, Harris has signaled that she’s interested in populism that can excite progressives and help deliver incisive messaging that undercuts the right’s claim to speak on behalf of the people. Those are promising instincts that I hope to see more of.   But perhaps the most consequential effect of this choice is that vice presidential candidates often become viable presidential candidates. There’s a very decent chance that Walz becomes a top-tier name in the party as a future presidential candidate, especially if Harris and Walz win and he handles his policy portfolio well. His emergence signals that the Democratic Party has a growing appetite for bold populism. That is in and of itself a healthy development, regardless of what happens in November."
Trump's initial response to Harris picking Walz is quite telling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 2:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-reaction-harris-walz-vp-pick-rcna165358,"Former President Donald Trump responded to Vice President Kamala Harris' selection of Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday with an uncharacteristically short statement that didn't mention the Minnesota governor by name. The GOP presidential nominee shared a cryptic post on his social media platform, Truth Social, shortly after Harris announced her pick that simply stated: ""THANK YOU!"" The typically reactionary Trump waited another roughly five hours to directly address the news: ""This is the most Radical Left duo in American history,"" the former president posted on Truth Social. ""There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again."" He went on in his 40-word missive to baselessly suggest that there is a ""BIG MOVEMENT"" to ""BRING BACK CROOKED JOE,"" an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, who withdrew his re-election bid last month amid pressure from top Democrats and donors. Trump followed that up with a longer exploration of his apparent fantasy that Biden will try to ""take back the Nomination"" when he attends the Democratic National Convention next week. ""He feels he made a historically tragic mistake by handing over the U.S. Presidency, a COUP, to the people in the World he hates most, and he wants it back, NOW!!!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. Though it seems clear Trump would rather face Biden in November, there's no indication the president is seeking to undermine Harris, whom Biden endorsed upon dropping out of the race and who formally secured the Democratic nomination on Monday. So far, Republicans appear to be struggling to come up with a cohesive line of attack against Walz, with some desperately taking shots at Walz because he created a Beyoncé Day last year ahead of her Renaissance Tour stop in Minneapolis. Others have accused the Democratic Party of being antisemitic because Harris, whose husband is Jewish, passed over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. ""No Jews allowed at the top of the Democratic Party,"" conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted on Tuesday, to which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, replied: ""News to me."" Trump will surely adopt a few talking points against Walz as the campaign goes on, but that his initial reaction was void of Walz-focused barbs and centered instead on an imagined scenario about Biden making a comeback is eyebrow-raising and, well, kind of ... weird."

What Jenna Ellis cooperating with prosecutors in Arizona’s ‘fake electors’ case means,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 2:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jenna-ellis-arizona-fake-electors-case-cooperation-rcna165359,"Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis is cooperating with Arizona authorities in the state’s “fake electors” prosecution. What are we to make of this development? To help understand it, we can look to the similar case in Georgia, in which a series of figures in Trump world were charged over efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden. When Ellis pleaded guilty in Fulton County last year, I noted that one high-profile Georgia defendant implicated by that move was Rudy Giuliani: The Arizona indictment likewise notes that Ellis “worked closely” with Giuliani. Given the state’s decision to reach a cooperation agreement, prosecutors could be satisfied that she can truthfully detail that work in a way that helps prove their case at trial; gets other defendants to plead guilty; or both. (Giuliani has pleaded not guilty, as he did in Georgia.) So, it’s more potentially ominous news for at least Giuliani, whose legal woes are legion. And beyond that? Whether Trump’s criminal exposure has increased is a natural thing to wonder about. Recall that, unlike in Georgia, Trump wasn’t charged in Arizona but rather was referenced as an unindicted alleged co-conspirator. (I explored possible reasons for the different treatment in this post.) Ultimately, it’s the Arizona prosecutors who have the best idea of how they want to use Ellis, based on their conversations with her and among themselves. What we know is that the state says it’s confident in Ellis’ value. “Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in announcing the deal. And the incentive for Ellis to cooperate is great. Unlike in Georgia, where she got a good deal in pleading guilty without receiving jail time, Arizona prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for her cooperation. In doing so, the state prosecutors noted that they could charge her again if she fails to comply with the agreement, which says that she must (among other things) “testify completely and truthfully at any time and any place requested by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, including at any state or federal grand jury proceeding, forfeiture proceeding, bond hearing, pretrial hearing, civil and criminal trial, retrial or post-trial hearing.” So it’s early yet in the Arizona case, and it could be a while longer until we know the full shape that it takes. Yet it’s possible that it proceeds more expeditiously than the Georgia case, even though that one was brought last year, because the Georgia case is currently tied up on a pretrial appeal in which the defense is seeking to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. While those aren’t the only two states prosecuting alleged schemes related to the 2020 election, the uncertain fate of the Georgia case shines an even brighter light on whatever comes in Arizona.

Trump dances for votes in awkward effort to win young supporters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 1:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-adin-ross-interview-youth-outreach-rcna165419,"As part of his campaign’s effort to woo young voters, men in particular, Donald Trump gave another cringeworthy interview to a young, right-wing video streamer on Tuesday.  Trump met with Adin Ross, who has used his popular platform to promote people like neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes and who was banned from Twitch for ""hateful conduct"" after his stream featured an unmoderated chat filled with racial slurs. The fawning Trump interview came as Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has had a surge in popularity with young voters. And Trump’s appearance with Ross came days after conservatives launched a $20 million voter outreach effort designed to mobilize young, male voters using the pro-Trump podcast “Full Send,” the Ultimate Fighting Championship and other Trump-friendly platforms.  Interviews like these appear to be part of an effort to establish an air of coolness around Trump. And it's somewhat similar to what has been done with Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s self-described “coolest dictator in the world,” who is frequently touted by MAGA Republicans these days.  So what did Trump do to attract the youngs on Tuesday? He walked out to a 50 Cent song; he called antisemitic rapper Ye a “complicated” but “really nice guy”; and he claimed rapper Young Thug (aka Jeffrey Williams) has been treated “unfairly” by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is trying a RICO case against Willams — as well as that separate RICO case against Trump you may have heard about (both Williams and Trump have pleaded not guilty). There’s ample reporting about the Trump campaign’s attempts to align itself with rappers to lure young, Black male voters, and this seemed a continuation of those dubious efforts. As I’ve written in the past, Trump has tried to use the Young Thug trial to curry favor with Black men while sowing distrust toward Willis, who he has claimed is “racist” against him. (Williams' lawyer, for the record, has rejected similarities between that trial and the 2020 election cases.) Continuing his disturbing deference to authoritarian figures, Trump praised Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for purportedly making that country “safer than our cities.” Meanwhile, Maduro is currently refusing to leave office after the opposition and outside observers challenged his claim that he won re-election late last month, sparking mass protests that Venezuelan authorities have responded to with deadly force. I wouldn’t call that “safe.” Trump also did a herky-jerky dance while telling voters he’d “keep TikTok” if elected, reaffirming his latest stance on the app, the one he appears to have taken after a right-wing billionaire investor in TikTok endorsed his campaign. (Harris, who recently launched her own TikTok account, hasn’t said whether she supports the legislation, signed by President Joe Biden, to divest the company of its Chinese ownership.) Ross also presented Trump with a Cybertruck and a Rolex watch, which might have run afoul of campaign finance rules. In all of these interactions, Trump looked like a 78-year-old candidate who is grasping at straws to seem young and hip. Trump is literally dancing for votes now. This is only the beginning of the MAGA youth voter mobilization effort. They have millions of dollars to spend, and I expect much more awkward dancing to follow. "
'Hillbilly Elegy' vs. a real hillbilly: Tim Walz is the perfect contrast to JD Vance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 1:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/walz-vance-harris-trump-ticket-contrast-rcna165405,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" With Kamala Harris’ choice to name Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, we now know who will face off against Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in November.  And the contrast between the two candidates couldn’t be any clearer. You’ve got “Hillbilly Elegy” versus a real hillbilly. The guy who went to Yale up against the guy who can teach you how to fix your car.  Walz’s personal narrative is strong and voters will take notice. Unsurprisingly, the attacks from Republicans have already started to pour in. They’re labeling the Harris-Walz ticket as radically progressive. But I’m not buying that line and neither should voters. Just look at Walz’s voting record during his time in the House. It’s far from progressive. And while some may point to his accomplishments as Minnesota governor, last time I checked feeding kids lunch and breakfast was not a progressive or conservative policy. It’s what a governor should do for the people of his state. That’s not to say there aren’t valid questions regarding Walz’s record. In 2020, the governor faced intense criticism for his slow response after protests in his state over George Floyd’s murder turned violent. But I also believe that’s something the vice president’s team took into consideration during Walz’s vetting process.  Overall, this is a strong pick from the Harris campaign. While Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was many people’s first choice — he was one of my top contenders as well — Harris’ selection of Walz shows us a preview of what kind of leader she will be in office. It shows she’s willing to go against the grain. I think that bodes well for how she may set up her administration. If this race does boil down to Harris and Walz’s “progressivism,” their competition is Trump and Vance’s MAGAism. One team wants to be an authoritarian regime, the other wants to try to govern the nation. You can talk about ideological lines all day long but, at the end of the day, the question for voters this November is clear: What will this country look like with either one of those tickets in the White House? That’s what voters have to decide. And I, for one, hope they land on the side of governing the country, not setting up a dictatorship.

The lede is an immediate attention-grabber: The Post’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that records indicate that four men ultimately arrived at the state-run National Bank of Egypt and carried away bags containing nearly $10 million in bundles of $100 bills. The money represented “what was then a sizable share of Egypt’s reserve of U.S. currency.” A variety of questions obviously came to the fore. Where’d the money go? What did officials linked to the Egyptian intelligence service want with roughly 200 pounds of $100 bills? According to the reporting, some FBI agents were concerned that the money was intended to go to Trump. In fact, those agents reportedly opened an investigation into whether Egypt illegally funneled $10 million in cash to the Republican for his 2016 campaign. And while that might sound like the basis for an incredible story, we’re just getting started. U.S. investigators, relying on U.S. intelligence, reportedly came to believe that Egypt’s then-president wanted to give Trump $10 million to boost his 2016 candidacy. Around the same time, Trump met with Egypt’s then-president, praising him on Fox News soon after as a “fantastic guy.” We don’t know whether Egypt gave Trump the money. We do know that a few weeks after Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi — the one who apparently wanted to give the Republican $10 million — Trump somehow produced $10 million of his own money for his campaign. It was, however, structured as a loan so Trump would get the money back. The then-GOP candidate, of course, ultimately won the election. It was during that presidential transition period, shortly before Inauguration Day 2017, when an organization linked to the Egyptian intelligence service picked up 200 pounds of $100 bills from Egypt’s state-run national bank. Soon after, Egypt’s president became one of Trump’s first foreign guests at the White House — a generous diplomatic gesture — and the then-American president ultimately released over $1 billion in military aid for Egypt. U.S. investigators never proved that the cash from that Egyptian bank went to Trump. That would’ve required access to more of Trump’s financial records, which they didn’t get. Why not? According to the Post, because then-Attorney General Bill Barr intervened to prevent FBI agents from subpoenaing Trump’s financial records. What’s more, Barr removed the relevant prosecutor — and her replacement — until the controversial A.G. finally arrived at a prosecutor who shut down the investigation altogether. Trump has denied wrongdoing, though as Rachel noted on last night’s show, he has the wherewithal to simply shut down all questions by releasing relevant financial records. To date, that hasn’t happened. A few months ago, Trump falsely accused President Joe Biden of “receiving money, for no apparent reason, from foreign countries.” Given this, it would appear that the former president has opened the door to some provocative questions from the recent past."
Tim Walz knows exactly how Republicans will attack him. And how to counter.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 12:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/minnesota-republicans-attacks-on-walz-future-gop-strategies-rcna165368,"In 2018, when then-Rep. Tim Walz was first running for governor of Minnesota, he had the blue wave of anti-Trump organizing at his back and cruised to an easy victory by over 11 points. The Republican campaign attacks weren’t particularly beyond the pale. But 2022 was different. Minnesota Republicans thought it was their turn to capitalize on what they thought was going to be a red wave. What’s more, thanks to the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising inflation and the aftermath of the George Floyd uprising in the Twin Cities, the MNGOP thought it had found wedge issues that would peel white suburban support away from Walz and take back the governor’s mansion.  Now that Vice President Kamala Harris has named Tim Walz as her running mate, national Republicans are likely to follow the same playbook as Minnesotans did in 2022. Democrats need to be ready to meet the moment. Every incumbent faced criticism over their response to the pandemic, as Covid presented challenges to which there were few answers. Minnesota Republicans fixed on two approaches — first, that Walz had abused his emergency powers in mandating masks and closing down businesses during the height of the lockdown. Second, that Walz’s lax oversight was at least partially responsible for a massive fraud in which criminals stole $250 million in pandemic relief funds intended to feed kids.  Republicans paired this with attacks blaming Walz for poor decisions during the George Floyd uprising, which they suggested had led to the destruction of property (especially a police precinct) and what they characterized as an ongoing crime wave that had turned the Twin Cities into an apocalyptic hellhole. The Republican hope was that by cloaking racism in “what about crime” rhetoric, while also blaming Walz for inflation, they could peel away key white voting demographics.  In the days before the election, the MNGOP put out a video alleging, “Since Gov. Tim Walz took office, our streets are less safe, families pay more for what they need every day, and children have fallen way behind in school.” Picturing Walz next to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (the first Muslim ever elected to the U.S. Congress, and later the first Muslim elected to a statewide office), a popular MNGOP target for racist attacks, the GOP blamed Walz for soaring prices and rising crime, and claimed the Covid lockdowns meant children were struggling in schools.  These kinds of attacks play neatly into the current rhetoric of the Trump-Vance campaign, and we’re likely to see them resurface over the next three months.  But the lessons from Minnesota offer counters to such attacks.  First of all, the Twin Cities are generally an exceptionally pleasant place to live, work and visit — are not, in, fact a hellhole. Violent crime is declining, if still too high.  The most salient criticisms of Walz come from the left — that he has, for example, been too harsh in clearing encampments for unhoused people, though even on that issue many critics acknowledge that Walz has provided much more in the way of resources to aid those experiencing homelessness.  Second, of course, is Walz himself. He’s a white, male, football coach, social studies teacher, Army veteran from downstate Minnesota — an agricultural and rural area. He’s consistently overcome — or at least limited the effectiveness of — attempts to divide the state between rural and urban, white and communities of color.  And third, he’s aggressively “normal” in an era when Republicans are aggressively weird, as Walz has been saying for months.  His opponents in 2022 were Scott Jensen, a retired doctor turned celebrity anti-vaxxer and promoter of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election, and Matt Birk, a retired NFL football player best known for questioning whether women should have careers and blaming Democrats for “playing the rape card” in the fight over reproductive freedom. It turns out that in the face of conspiracy-mongering and sexism, it’s hard to keep people focused on the price of milk and gas. Jensen and Birk were weird and off-putting. In 2022, Walz won the governorship by over 8 points. Other statewide elections were closer, but the MNGOP still hasn’t won any state contests since 2006. They’re too weird. Trump and Vance are no less weird or extreme in their policy proposals. And so as they pick up the Minnesota Republican playbook against Walz, it’s hard to believe they’re going to do any better. Or at least, clearly the Harris campaign looked into the heartland, saw a teacher, coach and veteran, and believed that he could be the next Minnesotan to serve as vice president. It’s a proud history. It hasn’t yet worked out as well when Minnesota VPs run for president, but hopefully that’s a problem we can worry about in 2032."
The Harris-Walz ticket could make history in an unexpected way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 12:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/peggy-flanagan-minnesota-first-native-american-woman-governor-rcna165380,"As a Black and Asian American woman, much has been made of the history-making potential of Kamala Harris’ candidacy for president. With her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she has teed up another prospective “first”: If the Harris-Walz ticket wins the White House, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the country’s first Native American woman to be governor. A member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, Flanagan was elected lieutenant governor in 2018 after serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives. She and Walz easily won re-election in 2022. Flanagan, 44, is the nation’s highest-ranking Native woman elected to executive office, according to her official biography. As laid out in the Minnesota Constitution, Flanagan would assume the governorship if the Democratic ticket were to win the White House, or if Walz steps down to campaign (he has not indicated that he would). On Tuesday, Flanagan congratulated Walz for becoming Harris’ running mate, writing on X: As lieutenant governor, Flanagan has been a leading voice in Minnesota for Indigenous rights. She formed the state’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office and has helped shore up relations between the state government and Minnesota’s tribal nations. Flanagan is also an outspoken advocate for abortion rights. Last month, after Iowa enacted a six-week abortion ban, she toured a Minnesota abortion clinic and welcomed out-of-state patients seeking help. “If you’re afraid, come to Minnesota,” Flanagan said. “We’ve got you.”"
"On governing experience, Tim Walz tops JD Vance (by a wide margin)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 9:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/governing-experience-tim-walz-tops-jd-vance-election-2024-trump-harris-rcna165394,"It was a little surprising last week to see Fox News’ Laura Ingraham criticize Vice President Kamala Harris for having “no experience.” There are credible lines of attack against the California Democrat, but this isn’t one of them. After all, Harris has a lengthy record of public service that spans decades, which includes stints as a prosecutor, a state attorney general, a U.S. senator and most recently nearly four years as the nation’s vice president. For voters concerned about experience, this is a bar the Democrat has easily cleared. In contrast, when Donald Trump was sworn into office in January 2017, the Republican was quite literally the least experienced president in the nation’s history. Indeed, Trump was the only American president to take office despite having no record of public service — at any time, at any level, in any capacity. By any fair measure, the television personality–turned–politician reached the White House despite knowing very little about the presidency or even how the federal government worked. But now that both major parties’ 2024 tickets are complete, we can also compare the Democratic and Republican running mates by their years of experience. Sen. JD Vance, for example, is the least experienced vice-presidential nominee for either party in nearly nine decades. The Ohio Republican did serve in the Marines for four years, but in terms of elected office, Vance has run one race — in which he badly underperformed in a red state — and arrived on Capitol Hill last year. The 40-year-old lawmaker has never passed a bill or helped lead a committee as either a chair or a ranking member. Trump and Vance combined have roughly five and a half years of governing experience. And then there’s Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz: If we widen the aperture a bit as to what should be included as part of a record of public service, it’s also worth emphasizing that Walz was a public high school social studies teacher and football coach. Or put another way, Trump picked one of the least experienced running mates in American history, and Harris picked one of the most experienced running mates in American history."
"6 things to know about Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' pick for running mate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 9:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-vice-president-pick-tim-walz-what-know-rcna165337,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was little-known outside his state until he surged to the top of Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate shortlist in recent weeks, has officially been confirmed as Harris' vice presidential pick. The 60-year-old governor's track record of winning over red-leaning voters makes him a compelling choice for the Democratic presidential ticket. Here's what to know about Harris' running mate: Born in West Point, Nebraska, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He graduated from Chadron State College in 1989. With his wife, Gwen, he moved in 1996 to Mankato, Minnesota, where he taught in a public school for more than a decade before entering politics. He also has a master's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato. Walz is the first vice presidential candidate on a Democratic ticket since 1964 who did not attend law school. Walz took up temporary teaching gigs in China and on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota before landing at Mankato West High School, where he taught geography and coached football for more than a decade. In the mid-'90s, he became the faculty adviser to the school's first gay-straight alliance — a role that Jacob Reitan, Mankato West's first openly gay student, told The Washington Post was crucial. “He set an example not just for LGTBQ students but for football players in the locker room at a time where gay people were not well understood,” Reitan said, adding that it was a sign of Walz's ability to “sell seemingly progressive ideas to seemingly not progressive crowds.” Walz was first elected to represent Minnesota's 1st Congressional District in the House in 2006, a seat he was re-elected to five times. Walz ran and won his last election for the district in 2016, the same year Donald Trump swept it by 15 points. Minnesota Democrats, fresh off gaining control of the state Legislature after the 2022 midterm elections, had a historically productive legislative session. With Walz as governor, they secured free school lunches and free college tuition for some families, codified abortion rights, enacted stricter gun violence prevention laws, expanded protections for transgender youth and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people. The Star Tribune described the 2023 session as ""one of the most consequential sessions in state history."" In the early years of his congressional career, Walz, an avid hunter, had been one of the increasingly few Democrats who received an A rating from the National Rifle Association. He began to change his tune on gun rights after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. As a candidate for Minnesota governor, he pushed for an assault weapons ban in the state and said he would no longer accept money from the NRA. Walz faced some criticism at the time, both from gun rights activists and from Democrats who questioned why he had changed his stance only while running for governor. He has credited his then-17-year-old daughter, Hope, for the shift, saying that she urged him to do more to stop gun violence after Parkland. Walz is not a national figure, but his TV appearances in the past few weeks have significantly boosted his name recognition and bolstered his case to be Harris' running mate. His interviews on cable news helped underscore his relatability and his skill as a communicator, and they endeared him to many Democrats. His most effective attack on Republicans so far?

"Like Kamala Harris, my name has been mispronounced my whole life. Here’s how I reclaimed it.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 9:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/kamala-harris-name-mispronounced-whole-life-s-reclaimed-rcna165347,"My first and last names have been mispronounced my whole life. By friends, work colleagues, and even emcees announcing me as an event’s keynote speaker to rooms of thousands. I entered my own book launch event with a huge sign outside that had both my names misspelled.  As someone of Indian-Singaporean descent and a semi-public figure, any time I’ve introduced myself to a Western audience, I’ve cringed. I know that mispronunciation and awkwardness are par for the course. I can imagine, with all of my being, what it must be like for Vice President Kamala Harris — the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — whose name has been deliberately mispronounced by her opponents in an effort to denigrate her candidacy.  And now, just to make things more complicated, I’ve decided to publicly change my last name.  I’ve made a career of creating a sense of belonging through intention, stories and action. But I’ve been hiding a secret: my last name hasn’t provided me with a sense of familial or social foundation for a long time.  In a world that doesn’t easily allow women, women of color, and those who are not public figures to change our minds, I am doing what I have said I’d never do as a feminist.  I’m changing my last name to “Malhotra” to match that of my husband and my son.  The reasons are complicated, and some of them I’m choosing to keep private. “Tulshyan” doesn’t resonate with me because it reminds me of the fraud and deceit of the man I inherited it from — my estranged father.  I didn’t make this decision lightly.  Like many professional, straight women who marry or who have become estranged from one or all members of their family of origin, I’ve wrung my hands thinking through the feminist implications of changing my name after establishing a public identity. After years of agonizing about how to distance myself from a name that’s never quite fit — literally as podcast, upon article, upon blog post published with that very last name — the decision became crystal clear as I finished the last chapter of my next book, “Uncompete: Dismantling a Competition Mindset to Unlock Liberation, Opportunity, and Peace.” In it, I write: “In order to create a world that’s better than we found it, our decisions must be guided by the legacy we want to leave. As Jonas Salk reminds us to ask: ‘Are we being good ancestors?’”  The good ancestor I’m striving to be for my 8-year-old son makes it urgent that we have the same last name. Simultaneously, I am grieving leaving my old name behind because of the bond of love I do have with the people who I once shared it with: my mother and siblings. I’ve also been reflecting on Kamala Harris, whose first name — an Indian one that means lotus — has been deliberately mispronounced time and time again, including by her colleagues at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago. Linguistics professor Darin Flynn writes that conservative media personality Tucker Carlson’s mispronunciation of Kamala is “a textbook example of a linguistic process called ‘hyperforeignization,’ where speakers go out of their way to refit foreign-looking words with pseudo-foreign speech sounds and sound patterns.” Of course, I know this too well, having experienced it firsthand in every school, college, workplace and social setting I’ve been in. As a former journalist and the author of two books with a third on the way, my name is more Google-able than average and harder to pronounce than average. Despite the accomplishments tied to it, I am changing it because I deserve a name that feels authentic to who I am and who I want to be, regardless of who it may inconvenience.  Names can help us stand out. They can help us fit in. Mine have only done the former, and just as people started to recognize my name, I’m changing it.  Our surnames often tell the world about our identity, offering clues about who we are, where we are from, our cultural background, and our family lineage. Our names reveal where we are in the human tapestry of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and — for better or worse — our families. I’ve talked about how pronouncing names correctly is a key foundation to being inclusive and anti-racist. The most commented section of a course I teach about inclusion is one where I talk openly about the shame I felt growing up with an unusual name and the path to reclaiming it. In short: I know that names really, really, really matter. Forcing people of color to change their names to be more “Western” has been part of the assimilation playbook since colonial times. Christian colonial missionaries in India, Africa and other parts of the world forced those they oppressed to change their names to become “less heathen.” The horrors of the residential boarding schools where American Indian and First Nation children were forcibly taken from their parents and coerced to “fit in,” including by adopting Western names, are well-documented.  The tradition to take on our father’s names is deeply Western and patriarchal, stemming from the 15th century when wives were considered property. Not until the 1970s did many states make it easier for a woman to keep her pre-married last name. Contrast this with other traditions, including the Khasi tribe in India, where children take their mother’s clan’s last name and women inherit land. Fluidity is common in the naming traditions of many Native American tribes, where children are given names according to their personalities. Their names can change throughout their lives to reflect their evolving identities and life circumstances. We all become more free when we think beyond the binary forced upon us and choose names that empower us. Changing my name to Malhotra feels most reflective of me, not least because of my identity as a mother of color.  My husband is a feminist and a loving role model for who I want my son to become. His name deserves to live on, more than my own father’s does. While the younger me thought it was anti-feminist to take it on, I now realize how the choice to decide either way — even if it may cause confusion — is a hard-earned privilege. If feminism is truly about choices, then this will be mine. It is a choice rooted in legacy, rather than accommodating white America with a more palatable-sounding name. That choice is something many people never experience, especially women from immigrant families. If feminism is about agency, then I’ll be honest. I wish I had more than just two choices when it comes to my last name. Western society doesn’t make it easy to build and maintain a legacy within its constraints. Having to choose only between my father’s or my husband’s name for the sake of being more easily categorized feels deeply patriarchal and unfair. I’m grateful for the support and conversations with my mother, sister and women friends. Some are instantly-identifiable authors and speakers, including some who changed their names. Each woman affirmed that I should focus on how my name made me feel and the legacy I hope to create for my son, rather than business or professional considerations.  As I work through this private struggle in public, I hope it will allow more people, particularly those like me with uncommon names, to make more authentic choices.  When I was introduced by my new name in a recent TV interview about Kamala Harris’ candidacy, it felt surreal — like they were talking about someone else.  But when I later watched the replay with my son, he pointed excitedly at the screen exclaiming, “Mum! You’re a Malhotra! Like me!”  And at that moment, it felt just right."

Don’t believe the naysayers — Tim Walz is an asset to the Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 8:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/tim-walz-kamala-harris-moderate-progressive-pick-2024-rcna165354,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate. And I, for one, think it’s a great pick. Republicans are already pushing back on Walz — trying to paint the governor as some far-left progressive. But that's just not the case. In reality, Walz grounds the vice president in a way that will really matter to voters, especially those not on the coasts. When Walz served in the House, he was elected in a very moderate district. There are many parts of Minnesota where it's not easy to get elected as a Democrat, and he represented one of them. He is much more moderate than people are giving him credit for. Although some believed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was the more moderate choice for the Democratic ticket, I challenge folks to find issues where Shapiro and Walz have major disagreements. Walz is not a coastal elite guy. He’s not an Ivy Leaguer. This is a guy who says things like, “You’d lose your hair, too, if you supervise a high school lunchroom for 20 years.” This is a guy who can give you advice on how to fix your car. He's a guy who served more than two decades in the National Guard. Tim Walz is a man who has served his country admirably. And he's going to be a real asset to the Harris campaign. What I think made the difference here is Walz's way of communicating. He is joyful when he’s on the attack. He almost does it with a wink and a smile. He has a sense of humor when he is going after these guys. And that’s what Harris needs.  She needs somebody who will keep the lightness in her campaign, somebody who will be a happy warrior — and that’s Tim Walz. He is one happy warrior, and I think he’s a terrific pick.

"Targeting Tim Walz, Team Trump flunks a test of self-awareness",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-tim-walz-team-trump-flunks-test-self-awareness-rcna165373,"No matter who Vice President Kamala Harris picked as her 2024 running mate, Donald Trump and his Republican campaign operation was prepared to go after him or her with a vengeance. In fact, it seems awfully likely that the over-the-top press statements and fundraising appeals were already written — and Team Trump was simply waiting for a name to fill in. It was against this backdrop that the former president’s campaign sent a solicitation to prospective donors this morning, telling them that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would “unleash hell on Earth” if the Democratic ticket prevails. No, seriously, that’s what the fundraising message said. But as it turns out, that’s not all the GOP nominee and his operation had to say. The Hill highlighted a written statement sent to the media from Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt: So, a few things. First, there’s nothing “dangerously liberal” about taking the climate crisis seriously. Second, it’s true that the Democratic governor restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people, but that’s a popular and just position for officials to take. But stepping back for a moment, is Donald Trump’s press secretary seriously prepared to make the case against convicted felons participating in our democracy? Because if so, Leavitt might be surprised to discover that in recent months, a jury found her boss guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. Indeed, it often seems as if the Republican Party is wholly unaware of the fact that it has a criminal leading its 2024 ticket. Trump himself recently declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” the GOP nominee said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” A little self-awareness goes a long way. The sooner Team Trump realizes that, the less embarrassing their public statements will be."

Gov. Geoff Duncan did something unusual: He became the first Republican to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 candidacy. This did not go unnoticed by the state GOP. On the contrary, the Georgia Republican Party responded to the news by launching an effort to expel Duncan from the party and ban him from ever again running as a GOP candidate. State party Chairman Josh McKoon added that Duncan will be “treated as a trespasser” if he seeks to attend any Georgia GOP event. Donald Trump — the one Sen. JD Vance said is not a “vengeful guy” — celebrated the Georgia Republican Party’s moves against Duncan, adding in an online message, “We have to purge the Party of people that go against our Candidates, and make it harder for a popular Republican President to beat the Radical Left Lunatics. Geoff Duncan is a loser who is disintegrating on his own. Congratulations to Josh McKoon for purging our Party of Misfits and people that don’t want to see us succeed!” As it turns out, Duncan isn’t the only Republican whom the former president is eager to “purge” from the party. Politico reported on one of today’s most notable congressional primaries: Though Trump usually endorses his favorite candidate in a given race, in this instance the former president endorsed both of Newhouse’s intraparty challengers: failed Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley and Jerrod Sessler, a former race car driver. (Technically, he endorsed Sessler four months ago, then told his followers a few days ago that he supports Smiley, too.) To be sure, Trump issues plenty of endorsements on a nearly daily basis, but this one stands out because of the motivation behind his campaign against the Washington incumbent. Revisiting our earlier coverage, when Trump was impeached for his role in the Jan. 6 attack, it resulted in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in American history. Against a backdrop in which Republicans seemed eager to move on from their failed, defeated president, 10 GOP House members voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the impeachment resolution, and they had every reason to believe they’d be vindicated by history. History, however, doesn’t elect members of Congress. Voters do. As the defeated, scandal-plagued, failed former president reclaimed control over the party and party leaders such as former Speaker Kevin McCarthy scurried to Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee, members of the Impeachment 10 came to realize that it didn’t matter that they were right. What mattered was that much of their radicalized political party wouldn’t tolerate their heresy, which would overshadow other parts of their careers in public service. Some saw the direction in the prevailing winds and decided to avoid the indignity of defeat. It’s why four members of the contingent — Ohio’s Anthony Gonzalez, New York’s John Katko, Illinois’ Adam Kinzinger and Michigan’s Fred Upton — announced their retirements before the 2022 primary season even began in earnest. Four more thought they could maintain the trust of the voters who’d elected them in the first place: It’s worth emphasizing for context that two of the four primary victors — Gibbs and Kent — ended up losing in the 2022 general elections, allowing Democrats to flip the seats from “red” to “blue.” As for the other two members of the Impeachment 10, California’s David Valadao narrowly won his re-election bid in 2022, while Washington’s Dan Newhouse cruised to a landslide victory two years ago. Trump has largely left Valadao alone, but the former president apparently believes Newhouse’s Washington district is conservative enough that he can help oust Newhouse, hand the nomination to an even more conservative rival, and the GOP can keep the seat. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Typically, presidential candidates pick running mates who address a weakness or build a bridge to the wing of their party alienated by their nomination. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower selected Richard Nixon, then seen as a pugnacious conservative, after he beat the right’s hero — Ohio Sen. Robert Taft — for the Republican nomination. In 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy, from Massachusetts, chose Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, from Texas, to give his ticket geographic balance. In 1968, Nixon settled on little-known Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew, because he was not objectionable to either the liberal or the conservative wing of his party. One Nixon aide remarked that if they had programmed a computer to produce a “Vice President who would do least harm to party unity,” it would have selected Agnew. Many more prominent possibilities would have enraged one wing of the GOP or the other. As a sign of how much more rudimentary (or nonexistent) vice presidential vetting was in the pre-Watergate era, Agnew would later resign in disgrace over kickbacks he had taken as governor. As voters started to warm to outsider candidates — usually governors with zero ties to Washington — vice presidential nominees became a way to build bridges to the political establishment and add an adviser with Washington experience. That was the case when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter selected Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale (who also provided geographic balance) to join his ticket in 1976. In 1980, after negotiations to put former President Gerald Ford on his ticket failed at the last minute, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan buried the hatchet and selected his strongest primary opponent, George H.W. Bush. The choice was an olive branch to the moderate wing of the party, which had serious concerns about Reagan. Eight years later, Bush did the inverse. Conservatives had long harbored doubts that he wasn’t really one of them, so he went with the boldest choice on his short list and selected Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, a young conservative up and comer, as his No. 2. Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton discarded the common formula in 1992 when he selected Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, a fellow Southern moderate, as his ticket mate. But the 46-year-old Clinton was running on generational change against the 68-year-old Bush. And the 44-year-old Gore fit with this theme. Eight years later, Gore also discarded the standard playbook for selecting a running mate in the hopes of distancing himself from Clinton’s personal scandals. He chose the devout Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — the first Jewish vice presidential nominee. The senator had been the first Democrat on the national stage to condemn Clinton for his peccadilloes. Gore anticipated that Lieberman’s rectitude would help appeal to voters who liked Clinton’s governance and policies, but cringed at his personal behavior, as well as blunt Republican attacks over Clinton’s character. Outsider nominees looked for something else beyond D.C. connections and governing experience when trying to balance their tickets: foreign policy credentials. That was a main reason George W. Bush selected former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to be Lieberman’s opposite in 2000. Similarly, Barack Obama, who had only spent four years in the Senate, chose Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden to run with him in 2008. There is one unmistakable pattern in the history: the worst vice presidential selections have the biggest impact. There are three glaring examples. First, third-party candidate George Wallace selected retired Gen. Curtis LeMay to be his running mate in 1968. Among LeMay’s blunders: ignoring the counsel of Wallace’s staff not to discuss nuclear weapons at his introductory press conference. Instead, he declared that Americans had a “phobia” about using them even though “there are many times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons.” A few weeks later, LeMay told an audience, “There are many cases when abortion is proper.” The question, according to the general, should be left up to “the people concerned and the physicians.” He simply had no political judgment. The abortion position alienated blue-collar Northern Catholics who were essential to Wallace’s bid. The LeMay disaster was one of the main reasons that Wallace’s support dropped off significantly in the final weeks of the campaign. Four years later, South Dakota Sen. George McGovern captured the Democratic nomination by taking advantage of a new selection process that placed much greater emphasis on primaries. Yet he was an insurgent, and he didn’t have the nomination locked down until the delegates to the Democratic National Convention reversed a decision by the Credentials Committee that had stripped McGovern of some of California’s delegates. With McGovern’s staff preoccupied with the intraparty battle, they didn’t focus on choosing a running mate until the last minute. The McGovern camp, especially the candidate himself, assumed that he could eventually prevail upon his top choice — Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy — to accept the vice presidential slot. When that proved impossible, McGovern’s staff undertook a chaotic and haphazard process with an impending deadline. After several other preferred choices declined offers to join McGovern’s ticket, and Kennedy demurred again, the South Dakotan selected Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton with fairly minimal vetting. That decision erupted on McGovern when it came out that Eagleton had received shock therapy for depression on multiple occasions in the 1960s. Eighteen days after McGovern selected Eagleton, he was forced to withdraw from the ticket. In 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain needed a bold move to reset the trajectory of the campaign. He rolled the dice on little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — the first female ever on the Republican ticket. In some ways, the selection worked brilliantly: Palin became a conservative rock star, enthusing the GOP base, which was ambivalent — or worse — about McCain. But Palin’s lack of knowledge of world affairs and clear lack of capacity to run the country did damage, in large part because McCain was 72 years old, at the time considered old for the presidency. The elder Bush’s choice of Quayle in 1988 wasn’t a blunder on quite the same level. Yet the rollout of his selection was exceedingly rocky, in part due to questions over whether Quayle’s wealthy family used connections to get the senator into the National Guard during the Vietnam War. He also produced one of the more infamous debate moments in history, and his weakness prompted future President George W. Bush to counsel his father to dump Quayle from the ticket in 1992 in favor of his defense secretary: Dick Cheney. The senior Bush didn’t take that advice and lost to Clinton. What does all of this mean for Harris? The next three months will tell us whether her staff properly vetted Walz, whether choosing him was advantageous politically, or whether she made a blunder for the ages. We’ll find out soon enough."
Kamala Harris picks Tim Walz as her running mate in bid for must-win states,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:14 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 6, 2024, 7:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-picks-tim-walz-vp-running-mate-rcna164315,"Vice President Kamala Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday, a selection Democrats hope will boost the ticket's chances among white rural voters in must-win swing states. Sources familiar with Harris' thinking confirmed the decision with NBC News and other media outlets on Tuesday morning. The Harris campaign later announced her choice in a text to supporters: Harris made the final decision on Tuesday morning, hours ahead of a scheduled campaign rally in Philadelphia with her new running mate set to kick off around 5 p.m. ET, according to NBC News.  Harris' choice of Walz as her running mate could broaden the ticket's appeal: Harris as a Black, Asian woman from California with experience as a prosecutor, and Walz as a white, folksy Midwesterner with a record of enacting progressive policies. Walz, picked from a formidable pool of candidates, is by no means a national figure in the Democratic Party. But he quickly rose to the top of Harris’ VP shortlist in recent weeks as he stumped for the de facto Democratic nominee on cable news, earning wide praise for his sharp criticism of the Donald Trump-JD Vance agenda. His labeling of Republicans as “weird” also caught on fast — and has appeared to strike a nerve among some Republicans. Although Minnesota is not considered a battleground state, Democrats are hoping that Walz’s personal story and his progressive credentials can help the ticket win over voters in rural areas who have been more drawn to the GOP in recent elections. Walz's allies have touted his background and his resume as a boon to the Harris ticket. A Nebraska native, the twice-elected Minnesota governor is a military veteran and a former schoolteacher and high school football coach. He represented a traditionally red-leaning district in Minnesota in the U.S. House for 12 years before being elected governor in 2019. Since 2022, when Democrats won control of the state Legislature, Walz has passed billions in funding for schools, including free school lunches; shored up abortion rights; secured stricter gun violence prevention laws; expanded up legal protections for transgender youth; and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people. Asked recently whether his progressive record could expose the Democratic ticket to more attacks, Walz suggested he wasn't bothered by labels. ""The fact of the matter is, where you see the policies that Vice President Harris was a part of making, Democratic governors across the country executed those policies, and quality of life is higher, the economies are better, all of those things,"" he said. ""If that's what they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label."""
Why the Jan. 6 'QAnon Shaman' can get his spear and helmet back,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/qanon-shaman-spear-helmet-jan-6-rcna165223,"The so-called QAnon Shaman can get his infamous spear and helmet back, a federal judge has decided, noting that the government never sought forfeiture of the property in the Jan. 6 case.   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth began his ruling Monday by observing that, while Jacob Chansley stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, like thousands of others, he stood out to the world due to his outfit of “a horned coyote-tail headdress; red, white, and blue face paint; gloves; and no shirt,” and that he had armed himself with what the judge called a “serious weapon”: “a six-foot pole with an American flag ziptied to the shaft and a metal spearhead fixed to the top.” Since pleading guilty in September of that year, Chansley has completed his prison term. Now he wants his property back. Lamberth agreed to the return, reasoning that “the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture.” Had it sought forfeiture by now, the Reagan appointee wrote, Chansley’s motion “may have turned out differently,” but the judge saw “no reason to delay or deny Mr. Chansley relief based on the government’s hypothetical future choice to take a step it could have already taken.” Prosecutors opposed Chansley’s request because they said they wanted to be certain that the case was completely over. They pointed to the Supreme Court’s June decision in Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants — specifically, the charge of obstructing an official proceeding to which Chansley pleaded guilty. But Lamberth said it’s unclear how Chansley could challenge his conviction at this point, and that even if prosecutors need the evidence in the future for some reason, there’s “voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley’s conduct.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

"Harris taps Tim Walz, the one Democrat who checked every box",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-taps-tim-walz-democrat-running-mate-ticket-election-2024-rcna165339,"By all accounts, as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowed her search for a running mate, the Democrat had six finalists in mind. They were, in alphabetical order, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Each had an impressive resume, and each would bring real value to the party’s 2024 ticket. Buttigieg, for example, is an incredible communicator. Kelly, meanwhile, is a decorated veteran. Shapiro and Pritzker were positioned to help the ticket in the nation’s most competitive region, while Beshear has demonstrated an ability to deliver a compelling Democratic message to rural and conservative voters. Of these five, some had experience in statewide office, some had experience in Congress, and some served in the military. But only one of the six finalists checked all of those boxes, combining all of the other candidates’ best qualities — and he’s the one who’ll stand alongside Harris. NBC News reported: As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted, “Harris’ choice of Walz as her running mate could broaden the ticket’s appeal: Harris as a Black, Asian woman from California with experience as a prosecutor, and Walz as a white, folksy Midwesterner with a record of enacting progressive policies.” I can imagine there are going to be a whole lot of voters nationwide who’ll respond to the news with the same question: “Tim who?” But it’s also safe to say that those who don’t yet know the governor are going to be impressed by his story. Walz enlisted in the National Guard as a teenager and served for more than two decades, including overseas deployments. He was a high school social studies teacher and football coach. When he ran for Congress, Walz was expected to struggle in a rural district that rarely voted Democratic, but he prevailed anyway and held the seat for 12 years. He then ran two successful gubernatorial campaigns and racked up some impressive progressive policy wins. As Clarissa-Jan’s report added, “Since 2022, when Democrats won control of the state Legislature, Walz has passed billions in funding for schools, including free school lunches; shored up abortion rights; secured stricter gun violence prevention laws; expanded legal protections for transgender youth; and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.” NBC News’ report went on to note that Walz also “enacted laws expanding paid family leave, banned most non-compete agreements ... and capped the price of insulin in Minnesota (three years before Biden did it nationally).” Not too shabby. But to appreciate why Harris tapped Walz for the Democratic ticket, it’s also important to emphasize just how impressive his audition has been. The entire party just went through an intense and compressed “mini-primary” process in which a bunch of would-be vice presidents engaged in public and private campaigns. As some of Walz’s MSNBC appearances helped prove, he stood out in impressive ways, earning raves from engaged and online audiences. As for the electoral implications, Democrats have expressed confidence of late that Walz will be a valuable asset throughout the Midwest. For his part, Trump recently insisted he’s “leading” in the North Star State and expects to win Minnesota “easily.” He should probably start lowering expectations drastically."
I didn’t vote for Tim Walz originally. Now I’m completely Walz-pilled.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 12:33 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 6, 2024, 6:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-pick-minnesota-rcna164157,"UPDATE (Aug. 6, 2024, 9:17 a.m. ET): On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz to be her 2024 running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thinks the leaders of the modern Republican Party — especially but not exclusively former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — are extremely “weird.” He has been saying so for months, but ever since Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, he has become one of her most effective messengers, doing the dirty work of attacking the Republicans so Harris can focus on a positive message — “Freedom.”  It has become easy to imagine Walz as the next Democratic nominee for vice president, one of a handful of politicians who have emerged as front-runners for the honor. If it happens, I’ll be thrilled. I’m a Minnesotan and have watched Walz since he started running for governor in the 2018 election. Before that, he was just a “downstate” congressman and not so much on my radar.  But much to my surprise, I’ve become fully “Walz-pilled,” not so much because of the viral clips, but because when he has had the opportunity, he has done everything he can to make Minnesota a better place for everyone. Frankly, I’m surprised at my own enthusiasm, because I wasn’t a Walz supporter when he ran for governor in 2018. This is inside baseball for Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor politics (not technically the Democratic Party), but Walz came into the race as the more electable, more conservative major candidate for governor. He seemed fine but boring, and it felt like in the coming blue wave anti-Trump election cycle, Minnesota could do better.  So I backed his rival, Erin Murphy, and she lost. I was disappointed but naturally voted for Walz in the general election and was happy enough that he won.  But I thought Walz would be a brake on progress, seeking the kind of consensus across the middle that just isn’t possible these days thanks to the devolution of the Republicans. And the Minnesota GOP seemed especially devolved, nominating far-right ideologues instead of trying to compete in a purple state. Turns out I was wrong. Walz’s first term was fine, marked by generally solid health-related leadership during Covid and some questionable decisions during the 2020 George Floyd uprising, but it was last year that everything changed.  In the 2022 elections, Democrats won a trifecta, taking full control of state government, but with a Senate majority of only one seat. DFL leaders never hesitated, taking advantage of a large budget surplus to quickly enact a wide range of progressive policies across the board that changed our state for the better.  They made Minnesota a safe haven for the trans community. They affirmed abortion as a fundamental right and removed restrictions that limited access. They legalized recreational cannabis use and passed laws for driver’s licenses for all Minnesotans regardless of immigration status, automatic voter registration, paid family and medical leave, tax rebates for people making less than $75,000 and new climate goals, and they phased out parental fees for families with kids on Medicaid. This last one is perhaps narrower than the others, but my son has Down syndrome and is on Medicaid, so I sure paid close attention to this. Tim Walz was just one of the Democratic leaders behind the unprecedented sweep of legislation, and arguably not even the most important. House leader Melissa Hortman and Senate leader Kari Dziedzic led the way, kept their caucuses united and got the bills to Walz’s desk. But he never hesitated and quickly became the public face of the movement, especially when he was signing bills for free lunch for all Minnesota school kids, no exceptions. Long before his name was mentioned in the veepstakes, he went viral for pictures of kids hugging him and then lining up for a high-five line as Walz clowned around in the classroom. I’m less interested in the identity politics surrounding Walz, though I recognize that as a Midwestern white dad, a veteran, a former social studies teacher and football coach and a dad from a small rural town, he has a background very distinguishable from Harris’.  But there’s an advantage to this. He can argue, as he did on MSNBC, that the genuine problems facing small-town white Americans are the fault of plutocrats — the Trumps of the world, venture capitalists like JD Vance and their backers. Because the problem isn’t just that they are weird creeps, but that they’re genuinely making lives worse for more people. Walz believes Democratic policies make lives better. At the end of the 2023 legislative session, Walz gave the memorable quote “Minnesota is showing the country you don’t win elections to bank political capital — you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”  When I heard that, I became entirely Walz-pilled, delighted to be led by a politician drawing from the best Minnesota traditions of “happy warriors” like former Democratic Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey (also a former vice president) and Paul Wellstone. I’m willing to share him with the nation. Too often, including in January 2021, Democrats have held power in Washington and acted too cautiously rather than risen to the moment. The Minnesota model shows there’s another way.  Sure, Republicans howled about the lack of bipartisanship, but that’s one of the lessons. Do one progressive act or do 50, the howl will be the same. And if you help enough people, voters will reward you. There’s some Midwestern dad energy that the nation sorely needs. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here, the case for Josh Shapiro here and the case for Mark Kelly here."
GOP insider: Trump’s anti-Harris messaging reflects a ‘nervous breakdown’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-nervous-breakdown-election-2024-rcna165324,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party spent two years preparing for one thing: a 2024 race against President Joe Biden. The GOP nominee and his team knew what they wanted to say, how they’d say it, when they’d say it and to whom they’d deliver the message. The former president would be an imperfect messenger who’d struggle to stay on-script, but Republicans at least had something resembling a plan. And then Biden passed the torch. To hear GOP officials and their allies tell it, they were prepared for a pivot. Those assurances weren’t true. Indeed, in the first week of the overhauled presidential race, Republicans — when they weren’t targeting Vice President Kamala Harris with racism and sexism — were reduced to focusing on her laugh, her affection for Venn diagrams and weird complaints about plastic straws. The second week was no better. One Fox News personality apparently thought it’d be a good idea to talk about the Democrat enjoying wine. Another spent some time focusing attention on Harris hugging people. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy whined, more than once, that the incumbent vice president didn’t call him during his congressional tenure to talk about his party’s non-existent policy agenda. It was difficult to imagine swing voters in battleground states hearing all of this and thinking, “Well in that case, Harris has lost my vote.” And then, of course, there’s the GOP nominee himself — who’s now referring to Harris as “Kamabla” for reasons I don’t understand — who spent much of last week questioning the vice president’s racial identity in deeply ugly ways. When that message didn’t resonate, Trump apparently decided to roll out yet another line of attack: As Politico reported, the Republican spent much of the weekend asking people to believe the vice president is an idiot. That wasn’t an exaggeration. In one online missive, the Republican nominee argued that Harris is “a LOW I.Q. INDIVIDUAL” who “can’t put two sentences together!!!” In another, Trump wrote that the vice president is “really DUMB,” “unable to speak properly without a Teleprompter” and has “an extremely Low IQ.” At this point, I could write a paragraph or two talking about how Harris is, in reality, smart. I could also add some sentences about how Mr. Let’s Inject Disinfectant Into People probably shouldn’t go around questioning others’ intellectual prowess. I could even take some time to note that if Trump genuinely believed that Harris is “dumb,” he wouldn’t be so terrified of sharing a debate stage with her. But there’s a larger point that’s also worth keeping in mind as the campaign advances: The former president is starting to look awfully desperate. Trump thought the race was effectively over after his debate with Biden, and now that the contest has changed, his anxiety about a possible defeat is pushing him toward panic. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” Election Day 2024 is three months away. Watch this space."
The most confounding similarity between Elon Musk and Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-election-2024-donald-trump-rcna165219,"There are a lot of unfortunate similarities between billionaire Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump. Both are petty and small-minded and crave the adulation of some of the most toxic people on the internet. But the most confounding connection hovers over Musk’s administration of X, just as it did over Trump’s White House, which is the question: “Just how much of this is on purpose?” Since acquiring X in late 2022, Musk has worked overtime to take a sledgehammer to what he’s perceived as the website’s faults. He’s laid off most of the staff, instituted wild swings in content moderation policy and otherwise broken what was once a vital part of the information ecosystem. The damage done is coming into sharp focus ahead of this fall’s presidential election, as a series of actions from the site broadly, and from Musk himself, raise suspicions of the reactionary CEO’s putting his thumb on the scale for Trump. After the success of a “Black Women for Harris” call on Zoom, another group, “White Dudes for Harris,” quickly followed its lead with a Zoom fundraiser of its own — raking in $4 million to support Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. But during that same call, the group’s X account, @dudes4harris, was suspended. Many quickly pointed fingers at Musk, accusing him of suspending the account because of its success and trying to keep more X users from donating. It’s not insignificant that just days before, Musk retweeted a Harris parody ad, in which a deepfake version of Harris appeared to call herself “the ultimate diversity hire.” Despite being a deepfake — digitally altering video of Harris’ mouth to match a voiceover — there was no label to indicate the video was manipulated, potentially breaking X’s own policies. Meanwhile, the “artificial intelligence” tool that Musk ordered built for the platform, Grok, has put out misleading info of late, falsely claiming that Harris has missed the ballot deadline in key swing states after President Joe Biden dropped out last month. And as CNBC reported, a federal political action committee that Musk created set up a website that claimed to help viewers register to vote. People with ZIP codes in battleground states, however, got no such help, instead only having their personal data collected. The last two of those have prompted major concern from election officials. A group of five secretaries of state drafted an open letter to Musk to call him to task for Grok’s misinformation and urge him to fix the bot’s output. Separately, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who signed on to that letter, also informed CNBC that her office is investigating whether America PAC’s information-gathering bait-and-switch was a violation of state election law. To be sure, none of the above cases are slam dunk evidence of shady practices at Musk’s X. The PAC’s webpage could just be broken, as one person with knowledge of its operations told CNBC that the links in question once worked — which tracks with Musk’s generally incompetent management of the site formerly known as Twitter. Experts likewise told CNBC that it’s unclear whether any Michigan laws were violated, even if it weren’t merely an innocent snafu. Grok’s promoting misinformation about ballots could also be less about Musk’s own issues and more about the shoddy state of AI in general. As for the “White Dudes for Harris” account’s being suspended? The Washington Post reported it was taken down for hours “because of ‘a user report’ for ‘violating [X’s] rules against evading suspension.” It’s not unthinkable that an unofficial account with no direct link to the Harris campaign’s blowing up that quickly — and asking people for money — tripped an internal alarm to ward off potential fraud. It’s a morass of high-stakes chaos and confusion, and it’s bringing up memories of Trump’s time in office for me. From the beginning of his administration, his increasingly sycophantic staffers transformed his whims into policy — and the results were frantic and volatile. But especially in the early days, it was often valid for an observer to stop and wonder how much of what we were seeing was normal government activity tinged through the lens of Trumpism versus actual departures from the norm. In those moments, it was likewise usually up in the air how much of the stress test of the system was the result of incompetence or deliberately plotted extremism. What I came to realize then, though, is that the answer to “is this incompetence or malice” all too often is “it doesn’t matter.” Intention was, and is, less important than the real-world effects of what we’re seeing. Whether due to malevolence or being terrible at his job, Musk has made X into a cesspool for anyone hoping to find the truth. And the reality is that as Musk has become more openly revanchist in his worldview, X has become a platform that is all too willing to let right-wing misinformation spread. It’s a forgoing of responsibility that is having deadly impact in the United Kingdom — and could have similarly disastrous effects if left unchecked during the U.S. election."
Why the Sept. 10 debate is shaping up to be a win-win for Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-debate-harris-kamala-sept-fox-rcna165178,"Former President Donald Trump is reportedly chickening out of the second presidential debate, insisting on a new date, setting and format that he thinks will favor him. But Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, plans to appear at the initially scheduled place and time — Sept. 10 on ABC — regardless of whether or not Trump shows. It’s a smart move that’ll help lay bare both Trump’s self-doubt, and his lack of interest in anything civic-minded that doesn’t help him. For months, Trump obsessed over the idea of a debate against President Joe Biden, framing his eagerness as “for the good of the country.” He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last year that he was ready to do “10 debates” with the president. In May, Biden’s and Trump’s campaigns agreed on the format for two presidential debates. And after Biden’s disastrous first debate performance, Trump didn’t express hesitation over the second debate scheduled for September and moderated by ABC News. But with Biden out of the race and with Harris set to replace him, Trump’s thinking has changed. He posted on Truth Social on Friday that the agreement he had made with Biden was “terminated” because “Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network …. thereby creating a conflict of interest.”  Neither excuse makes sense. Trump’s lawsuit against ABC — concerning anchor George Stephanopoulos’ saying Trump had been found “liable for rape” — was filed in March, weeks before he agreed to the ABC debate. And Trump and Biden didn’t just to agree to the debate because they thought it’d be a good time. They did so because they were considered de facto nominees for their parties. Now Harris is all but certain to be the nominee, so it only makes sense that she would take Biden’s place in the debate.  Indeed, Trump isn’t even pretending the debate is entirely off. He has instead proposed a new date and — more important — a new format. The debate, he says, should be held on Trump-worshipping turf at Fox News, and it should take place before a “full arena audience.”  Trump’s new debate terms give the game away. Now that he fears embarrassment against an energetic new candidate who can communicate far more effectively than her predecessor, he wants to rig the environment with moderators and audience members who are far more likely to make him look more competent, reasonable and well-liked than his opposition. This ploy tracks with Trump’s prior attitudes toward debates. While Trump was gunning for months for a debate with Biden, he refused to participate in a single debate in the Republican presidential primaries. Rather than participate for the “good of the country” or even just his party, he sought to delegitimize the Republican debates and even held events simultaneously to draw viewers away from them. His goal was clear: to sideline the opposition and turn the primaries into a coronation. And the result was equally clear: Trump showed disdain for the idea of public accountability and informing the public about his record or future policies. Trump’s threat to no-show the Sept. 10 debate makes Harris’ appearance that night a win-win scenario. If Trump doesn’t show up, she’ll get a sizable (albeit most likely more modest) prime-time audience and an opportunity to speak at length with the American people about her background, her policies and her vision of the future. Moreover, Trump’s non-appearance will generate countless headlines making him look cowardly. If, on the other hand, Trump reverses course and shows up, Harris will have an opportunity to showcase her policies and draw a contrast with her mendacious, rambling and authoritarian opponent. Trump will no longer benefit from going up against a candidate who was no longer fit for the debate stage. Regardless of how this shakes out, the entire back-and-forth works to Harris’ benefit. Trump looks afraid, and his desire to set up contests only where he thinks he can win is evident for all to see."
Kamala Harris is getting the thing Donald Trump always craves: attention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 3:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-donald-trump-games-attacks-attention-rcna165254,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 4 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Kamala Harris could announce her running mate at any moment, with the vice president set to reveal her pick ahead of their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday.  But the fact is, no matter whom she chooses, the announcement of this pick will only build even more momentum for the Harris campaign.  The vice president has already held a series of big, energizing rallies, like last week’s event in Atlanta featuring Megan Thee Stallion, where the rapper coined the phrase “Hotties for Harris.” She’s also brought on all-star campaign veterans like David Plouffe, Stephanie Cutter, Jennifer Palmieri and Mitch Stewart — adding to an already seasoned team.  The money continues to pour in at a crazy pace. The Harris campaign said this week they raised a record-breaking $310 million in July. She’s also up in the polls. Harris has a one-point edge nationally over Donald Trump, and the two are neck and neck across the collective battleground states, according to a new CBS News poll. Harris’ momentum is clear to anyone watching. What’s also clear is that all the attention on Harris is driving Trump kind of crazy — and he is twisting himself into a pretzel as a result.   At his rally on Saturday in Atlanta, Trump said some very strange things. Like when he congratulated President Vladimir Putin of all people for the historic prisoner swap that freed American citizens from Russia. He also repeatedly attacked Georgia’s very popular, very Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for not being sufficiently loyal. Despite their contentious past, and Kemp not supporting Trump in the primary, the governor was reportedly open to campaigning with the former president this fall. However, after Trump’s latest comments, that’s unlikely to happen. Like I said, he’s twisting himself into a strange pretzel. Earlier on Saturday, before sending his congratulations to a dictator and bashing a popular member of his own party, Trump made another self-sabotaging move — pulling out of a debate he already agreed to participate in.  Trump now says he won't attend the scheduled audience-less ABC News debate on Sept. 10. Instead, he proposed a debate on Fox News a week earlier with a full arena audience. Let’s pause on that for a moment: Trump’s saying he will not participate in a debate he already agreed to unless it turns into a MAGA rally with Fox moderators. Got it. Harris quickly called out the former president: “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space.’” As someone who’s worked on campaigns, I can tell you exactly what this is — this is what it looks like when one candidate has momentum and the other has no idea what to do about it. Here’s the thing: Harris will continue to own the spotlight for a while here. Her vice presidential pick is coming, she’ll hold rallies with her running mate all across battleground states next week, and a couple of weeks later, we’ll have the Democratic National Convention. And Trump is going to hate every second of that because he loves attention. As a result, he will get more and more outrageous and unhinged. That means we’re likely to see even more ugly, racist attacks like the one we saw from Trump in Chicago when he questioned the vice president’s racial identity.  But there is good news: Harris seems ready to respond to these attacks.  She told a crowd in Houston that Trump’s comments were just more of “the same old show,” and said the American people “deserve better.” “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us — they are an essential source of our strength,” Harris went on. That’s sort of the perfect response to all of this — to the racist attacks, to the unhinged rallies, to the games over debates: It’s the same old stuff, and America deserves better. Harris doesn’t make it about her. She makes it about the people they are running to represent. Not a bad message if you ask me.

I've run for public office. Kamala Harris is exactly the kind of candidate voters want.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-attacks-future-legacy-rcna165207,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""The Beat."" It’s hard for me not to get emotional about Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy. The American people are just starting to notice what an incredible, experienced and exciting leader she is. But for those of us who’ve followed her long career, that’s the Kamala Harris we’ve always known.  During her time as vice president, she has always been loyal to President Joe Biden. Even in the midst of all the panic over what was going to happen to the future of the Democratic Party and what was going to happen in this election cycle, she stayed loyal. However, as soon as Biden made his decision to leave the race and endorse his vice president, America finally had the chance to see the real Kamala Harris. For those of us who have had the privilege of seeking public office and asking for people’s trust, we know what voters want in return. They want to get to know you. They don’t want a presentation of what you think they may want — they want to know the real you. And that’s what Harris has shown to the American people. When she entered this race she came out as her full self. She came out powerfully and the people felt it. However, that doesn’t mean it’s been an easy few weeks for her. Harris has faced baseless attacks over her racial identity and qualifications.  This is someone who was a district attorney for a major city. Someone who was elected to a statewide office in California — the most populous state in the country. Someone who was elected to the U.S. Senate. And someone who is currently in the White House. There should be no debate over her qualifications. Her record speaks for itself. But these attacks against Harris are just an example of what we have to deal with — as Black women, as women of color, as women of any race — whenever we stand up and say, I can do this. Instead of having an honest discussion about ideas or qualifications, it devolves into personal attacks. And Harris has handled these baseless attacks masterfully. She’s been able to define herself without talking about herself. She's differentiated herself from Trump without calling him names. She's illustrated what kind of leader she is and will be if elected president. She's pointed at the future and told the American public this is what they deserve."

"In Kamala Harris’ California, ‘weird’ is the ultimate insult",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 2:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/weird-harris-trump-california-slang-rcna165232,"There’s been a lot of talk lately about Kamala Harris’ campaign’s effective use of the word “weird” to define Donald Trump and the Republican Party. It seems obvious to me this has gotten under the skin of both Trump and his running mate. Nonetheless, some people think it misses the mark. I think actor Wendell Pierce, for example, made a great argument that Democrats ought to call out right-wing racism and misogyny for what they are, rather than use a term that’s far more mild in comparison. Indeed, for someone with Trump’s history, “weird” can seem like a serious understatement. But at the same time, I’m a millennial raised on the West Coast and I know that the term has a slightly different connotation than some may associate with it, which I think speaks to its effectiveness. In Harris’ home state of California, for example, “weird” — for many young nonwhite people — doesn’t just mean quirky or unique, it’s used as an insult. That’s why there’s a genre of TikToks featuring young Californians talking about how being called “weird” — or its variant, “a weirdo” — is an offense that basically amounts to fighting words. Cali-based rapper YG’s song “Weird” explains — more crassly — the resonance the term has, while fellow California rapper Kendrick Lamar has used “weird” and “weirdo” on some of his diss tracks aimed at Drake, such as “Meet the Grahams” and “Not Like Us.” So, despite some understandable critique from fellow liberals, Harris and her campaign have settled on a term that appears to have cross-generational and cross-geographical appeal. “Weird” is a simple, straightforward term that voters of all ages can use, as my MSNBC colleague Ryan Teague Beckwith wrote, to describe Republicans whose “echo chambers and gerrymandered House districts” have led to ideas that are “increasingly extreme.” At the same time, the term is a familiar one to young voters of color — a constituency Harris will need to win in November."
College pics of Kamala Harris help highlight her Black Greek history,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 2:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-alpha-kappa-alpha-sorority-howard-rcna164185,"The mobilizing power of Black sororities has been in focus ever since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign last month. Harris, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. since her days at Howard University, has received rousing receptions at two major events for Black sororities in recent weeks, including the biennial convention for Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. and Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc.'s 60th biennial Boule. Any time Harris has pulled up to these events, her fellow Divine Nine sisters showed the palpable energy they — and Black Greeks broadly — stand to bring her campaign. For those familiar with Black Greek-letter organizations, there was never any question that members of these groups — which love to tout their esteemed legacies and pride themselves on their links to Black history — would broadly coalesce around Harris, as they did in 2020. I've noted several Black Greeks were speakers on the Win With Black Men organizing call for Harris last month. That call, which helped disprove a social media narrative about Black men being averse to voting for Harris, came on the heels of the previous night’s Win With Black Women call, which similarly featured multiple speakers from Black sororities. Both calls showed how Black Greeks and their networks can help mobilize Black folks around important political matters. And the possibility of electing the first AKA president — the first Black Greek president — is, as members of the org might say, a serious matter.   Late last month on “The ReidOut,” Joy Reid spoke with two of Harris’ line sisters (that is, women who pledged at the same time she did). After the clip aired, several viewers said they'd hoped to see some pics of the VP from her days on campus — or “on the yard,” as it’s often said. We'd included fairly recent photos of the VP and her line sisters in the segment, but we’re happy to share some throwbacks now that we have them! Check them out!

Donald Trump is out of control,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/donald-trump-kamala-harris-rally-georgia-rcna165244,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 5 episode of “Morning Joe.” During a campaign rally in Atlanta on Saturday, Donald Trump reignited one of his favorite old feuds. The former president spent roughly 10 minutes of his time on stage attacking Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, calling him “disloyal” and a “bad guy.” Trump told the crowd he blamed the governor for his criminal charges in the state, claiming Kemp could have shut down Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ investigation with a “phone call.” Now, attacking a popular sitting governor in his own state — a state you almost certainly will need to take back the White House — isn’t exactly a successful campaign strategy. And the only thing the former president succeeded in doing on Saturday was bringing even more negative attention to himself.  Trump clearly sees the enthusiasm surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. He knows enthusiasm comes first, then comes the uptick in the polling — which we’re already starting to see. If momentum continues to build for Harris, Trump knows where this is heading in November. What we saw Saturday was Trump responding to a chain of events that’s starting to feel out of his control.  Right now, he's grasping for anything. Trump's getting nastier, angrier and less disciplined. Every modicum of self-control he summoned during that weeklong period after the assassination attempt on him seems to be gone — like it's evaporated. "

That state wanted to sue the state of New York and block the former president’s gag order and upcoming sentencing following his guilty verdicts on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The high court denied Missouri’s motion Monday without explanation, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito noted in the order that they would have let the state file its complaint. While the two justices have recently sided with Trump, they have also previously signaled their disagreement with colleagues over the broader procedural issue of hearing lawsuits between states, indicating that they think the court must take such cases. This sort of case is different from the typical appeal at the Supreme Court, instead falling under the court’s “original” jurisdiction for suits between states. “New York’s prosecution of the presumptive Republican nominee is a transparent attempt to prevent the candidate disfavored by New York from freely campaigning,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, wrote to the justices last month, adding that it “threatens both the sovereign rights of Missouri and the constitutional rights of millions of its citizens.” New York Attorney General Letitia James opposed Missouri’s action, writing to the justices that “Missouri’s suit is based entirely on an ongoing criminal case between the Manhattan DA and former President Trump and does not present an actual controversy between sovereign States.” Trump is due to be sentenced in New York next month, but not before Judge Juan Merchan decides how, if at all, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling affects Trump’s state guilty verdicts. Merchan is expected to rule on the immunity issue Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects Trump’s immunity motion. The GOP presidential nominee also recently lost a New York state court appeal challenging his gag order ahead of sentencing.

"In Arizona’s fake electors case, Jenna Ellis agrees to cooperate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizonas-fake-elector-case-jenna-ellis-agrees-cooperate-rcna165256,"Last fall, Kris Mayes, Arizona’s Democratic state attorney general, told CNN that her office was overseeing a “robust” investigation related to Republicans’ fake electors scheme after the 2020 presidential election. We learned months later that she was quite sincere about this: An Arizona grand jury indicted 18 people in April — 11 fake electors and seven Donald Trump aides. There were some high-profile names among those charged, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis. On Monday, one of them flipped. NBC News reported: The good news for Ellis is that she’s no longer facing nine felony charges, and she no longer has to worry about ending up behind bars. The good news for prosecutors is that they now have a cooperating witness with key insights to share about the underlying electoral scheme. If these circumstances sound at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. In fact, it was last fall when Ellis pleaded guilty in Georgia to aiding and abetting false statements. The lawyer expressed what she described as “deep remorse” for her wrongdoing, adding that she shouldn’t have represented the former president in the case at all. As part of her agreement, the former Team Trump lawyer agreed to, among other things, provide evidence to prosecutors in Georgia — and as it turned out, she had information to share. It stands to reason that prosecutors in Arizona hope to benefit from a similar arrangement. There are legal experts who can speak to this with more authority than I can, but recent history suggests that after one defendant flips, others often follow. With this in mind, Ellis might be the first person to flip in the Arizona case, but there’s no reason to assume she’ll be the last. As for Ellis’ broader trajectory, the attorney has followed an unusual path. It might seem like ancient history, but in the 2016 campaign, she was not a Trump fan. As regular readers might recall, the Republican lawyer repeatedly described the then-candidate as an “idiot,” adding that she considered him “unethical, corrupt, lying, criminal, dirtbag.” Ellis even took aim at Trump’s supporters, saying they didn’t care about “facts or logic.” She later changed her mind. In fact, despite her rhetorical record, Ellis actually joined Trump’s legal team, becoming a rather enthusiastic proponent, not only of her client’s lies about his 2020 defeat, but also of radical tactics that would have allowed the then-president to remain in office despite the election results. Last year, she came full circle, declaring, “I simply can’t support him for elected office again.” Ellis added, “Why I have chosen to distance is because of that frankly malignant narcissistic tendency to simply say that he’s never done anything wrong.” If Trump starts going after Ellis by way of his social media platform, at least we’ll know why.

Elon Musk-backed PAC is facing an investigation in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:16 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-america-pac-michigan-investigation-rcna165186,"Michigan’s secretary of state is investigating a super PAC backed by Elon Musk over the group’s acquisition of voter information. CNBC reported Friday that America PAC, which Musk has said he created and helped fund amid his open support for Donald Trump, created a website ostensibly meant for voter registration — but it acts differently depending on who uses it. As CNBC reported: CNBC aptly noted that this meant people in battleground states who visited the site “got no help at all” with voter registration, but “they did hand over priceless personal data to a political operation” — data that someone like Musk, who owns a social media platform rife with right-wing disinformation, could easily use to microtarget voters with ads in the lead-up to November. On that note, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office said the state agency is reviewing Musk’s PAC out of concern for how the voter data is being used.  Per CNBC:  The result of the Michigan investigation may show that America PAC is operating completely within state law. Even so, that wouldn’t preclude how its website behaves from being unethical or downright eerie. CNBC reported that a person with direct knowledge of the PAC’s operations says that the group is planning to launch a new website soon. (CNBC said an America PAC spokesperson declined to comment and that Musk did not return emails seeking comment.) CNBC’s report serves as a timely reminder to be wary of “broligarchs,” a term that has emerged for rich white men in tech — like Musk — who desperately want to elect Trump and reap personal gains from the access they seem to feel will come as a result."
Senator: There are more flights Clarence Thomas failed to disclose,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senator-are-flights-clarence-thomas-failed-disclose-rcna165233,"After ethics questions surrounding Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas intensified, Senate Democrats began a formal process of seeking more information. The latest reporting from The New York Times suggests they’ve uncovered some relevant new details. The fact that the underlying issue is several years old doesn’t come as too big of a surprise: I first started writing about Crow and his generosity toward Thomas more than 13 years ago. But that doesn’t make the apparent revelation any less notable: The Senate Finance Committee appears to have evidence of another instance in which a sitting Supreme Court justice took flights on a Republican megadonor private plane and failed to disclose. In a detailed letter to Thomas’ attorney, Wyden, who chairs the Finance Committee, wrote, “I am deeply concerned that Mr. Crow may have been showering a public official with extravagant gifts, then writing off those gifts to lower his tax bill. This concern is only heightened by the Committee’s recent discovery of additional undisclosed international travel on Mr. Crow’s private jet by Justice Thomas. “As I consider legislative solutions to curb potentially abusive deductions, I am offering you one final opportunity to address the tax treatment of yacht and jet trips involving Justice Thomas.” For those who might benefit from a refresher, let’s circle back to our earlier coverage and review how we arrived at this point. Thomas has faced difficult ethics questions for many years, but his difficulties took a more serious turn last spring. ProPublica published a rather devastating report in early April of last year, shining a light on the generous and undisclosed benefits Thomas has received from a Republican megadonor. In the weeks and months that followed, ProPublica took the lead on exposing Thomas’ other unusual ties to his wealthy friend, but the outlet wasn’t alone. The New York Times also took the story further, shining a light on previously unreported benefits the justice has received from a “cohort of wealthy and powerful friends,” thanks to his connections established through the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. The Times added fresh reporting last summer on one of Thomas’ other wealthy pals providing the sitting justice with undisclosed financing that made it possible for Thomas to buy an expensive recreational vehicle. How big was the loan? Neither the justice nor his friend say. How much did Thomas repay? They wouldn’t say. What were the terms of the loan? They wouldn’t say. Was there a formal loan agreement? They wouldn’t say. Soon after, ProPublica published another report that made the entire controversy look considerably worse, noting that Thomas had received “at least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” In each instance, the far-right jurist’s luxurious benefits “have been underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence.” Though the precise value of the trips is difficult to measure, ProPublica described it as “likely in the millions” of dollars. It’s an impossible dynamic to defend: Thomas has lived the life of a wealthy man, thanks to the generosity of his rich, likeminded friends. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, “There is nothing partisan about calling this what it is: a brazen, shameful abuse of power that undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. That Thomas reportedly took these gifts is alarming enough. That he reportedly took them without disclosing that he had taken them (with rare exceptions) makes it hard to believe that Thomas doesn’t realize how bad this all looks.” Earlier this year it reached the point at which Thomas became a punch-line to jokes about Supreme Court corruption. (In February, The Onion, a satirical outlet, published a memorable item with a headline that read, “Clarence Thomas Announces 50% Discount On All Favorable Rulings.”) Last month, at least two senators asked the Justice Department to take matters to the next level with the appointment of a special counsel. Last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a package of reform measures, including a call for a binding code of conduct for the high court, with ethics rules that require justices to, among other things, disclose gifts.

The problem with Gorsuch's court reform warning to 'be careful',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 11:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/gorsuch-supreme-court-reforms-rcna165152,"In an interview with “Fox News Sunday” to promote his new book, Justice Neil Gorsuch offered some advice when asked about President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court reform proposals: “Be careful.” Caution is prudent — judicious, even — but the context surrounding Gorsuch’s remarks is worth exploring. In a clip of the interview, which aired in part on Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked the justice about Biden’s proposals, including term limits and an enforceable ethics code. Gorsuch demurred at first, noting that it’s a political issue in a presidential election year. Then he continued, “I have one thought to add”: So, what are we to make of Gorsuch’s thought? On the one hand, it’s cliched enough that it’s almost difficult to disagree with at a certain level of generality. Yes, people’s rights should be protected no matter who they are. Judges should be independent in all circumstances. It’s not entirely clear what juries have to do with this subject, but they’re an important part of our system, too. Yet, to the extent that the concern is that court reform threatens judicial independence: How is that, exactly? It’s unclear how term limits, for example, would make judges less independent, as opposed to them simply serving for shorter, predetermined amounts of time. The status quo, meanwhile, is a chaotic, inherently politicized one in which justices seek to time their retirements so that a president from the political party that appointed them can nominate their replacement. Perhaps that’s independence in the sense that it’s what a given justice wants, but it’s difficult to see how that leads to greater fairness for the people bound by the high court’s rulings. Judges are cautious creatures. And any powerful official, Supreme Court justices included, won’t relinquish power easily, whether by way of being checked by a co-equal branch of government or otherwise. But if caution is warranted in altering the status quo, then it’s warranted in maintaining it, too.

I'm Black and Asian. Trump's attack on Kamala Harris was an attack on me.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 10:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-attack-kamala-harris-nabj-racist-xenophobia-rcna164871,"As a woman of color who has spent my whole life fighting bigotry, I didn’t think I could be more offended by the candidate running for president at the top of the Republican ticket. But then, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) made former President Donald Trump sit on a stage with three Black women journalists, where he illustrated the full extent of his racist xenophobia. Trump made many offensive remarks in that appearance Wednesday in Chicago; chief among the triggers for me was the way he questioned the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has now enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination and is soon expected to officially become the first Black woman and the first Indian woman to head a major party’s ticket. Trump said, “She was … of Indian heritage…until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He then asked ""Is she Indian or is she Black?” It’s incredible that in 2024, he asked that question — as if she couldn’t possibly be both. Harris’ background is well documented. Her father is a Black Jamaican. Her mother was Indian. Thirty-eight years ago, she graduated from Howard University, an HBCU, where she pledged the country’s oldest Black sorority. Trump remains trapped in the era in America in which people were expected to have a single racial identity. And, to be clear, that time was not so long ago. As recently as 1997, I left Jamaica as a woman of both Black and Asian heritage. I knew myself, without controversy, to be biracial. Then I arrived in the United States, where I was only Black. Suddenly, I found myself explaining my Chinese surname to white people who questioned me about it. If the conversation went further, then I had to make the case for identifying as both Black and Chinese. This reality was starkly different from my experience back home, where my Asian heritage was not in opposition to my Black heritage. In post-colonial Black Jamaica, being mixed carried some measure of privilege — it also came with some derision, but never, ever, denial. Everyone there accepted me as Black and Asian. In the United States, I was expected to be Black or Asian.  In a 2019 interview on “The Breakfast Club,” Harris said it herself: “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. I was born Black, I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.”  Trump has seized upon a video of her in the kitchen with the Indian American actress Mindy Kaling in which Harris enthusiastically affirms Kaling’s description of her as Indian and tells the actress, “You look like the entire one half of my family.” Kaling says, “I’ve been telling people we’re related already. This is perfect.” In a social media post, Trump says Harris “is saying she’s Indian, not Black. This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” Trump seeks to take the power of belonging to both Black and Indian cultures from Harris. He attempts to delegitimize her by insisting that belonging to both makes her some sort of traitor, somehow deviant, freakish, abnormal. Trump is tapping into a disturbingly pervasive American belief in a racial binary, that you’ve got to be one thing or another. Black folks all over the world know our community is of mixed-racial heritage. We understand that the one-drop rule, which says that anybody with one drop of Black blood is Black, is, at its core, reductive. That rule was meant to exclude Black people from the privileges afforded only to those possessing the visible quality of whiteness; being of mixed race often denied you a white heritage, but your Black racial identity was never contested. It was always yours to keep, perhaps because no one inside the racist patriarchy could imagine anyone else wanting it. But in the present political climate where the percentage of white voters is shrinking — Harris being doubly of color makes Trump nervous. That she could excite Black voters to the extent that they were excited when Barack Obama ran for president is making the party of white nationalism nervous. That she could consolidate the Indian American vote makes her a double threat. That she could inspire women to turn out this November makes her a virtual atomic bomb to the GOP. Historically, people of color had to be whatever white people said we were. Now that they’re afraid that being a person of color may provide some limited benefit, they wish to intimate that race is something mutable, subject to flights of fancy. It is terrifyingly revealing, that the practice of racial exclusivity, which Black people had nothing to do with, is being refashioned into a weapon against Harris in the moment when her blackness could be of some benefit to her and the community that supports her bid for the presidency.  James Baldwin, who was born 100 years ago this month, said it best, “We can disagree and still love each other, unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.” Trump’s comments deny the humanity of biracial people and challenges our right to exist. He bugles a call being taken up by many who follow his lead. The day Biden endorsed Harris for president, I posted on Instagram, “OMG!!! We got a Black Woman in the US presidential election!” In no time, there were more than 500 comments from the MAGA camp denying Harris’ Blackness, berating her as the unqualified DEI hire and accusing me of being racist. Multiple people reported the post as offensive. Some directly messaged me to ask how I would feel if they had posted about a white man running for president. When my answer did not suffice, I was dismissed as a “dumb coconut” who didn’t deserve to vote because I didn’t have the good sense to see through a candidate who was pretending to be Black to get my vote. Pretending to be Black. Unless they look white and are trying hard to pass, nobody’s Blackness in America is invisible. To suggest that Blackness is a cloak that Harris can put on and remove at will is to discredit the experience of millions of voting Americans who navigate the pitfalls of racial oppression daily. What his off-the-rails performance at the NABJ convention illustrates is Trump’s inability to come to terms with the changing face of the Unites States of America. Trump, the MAGA candidate, longs for the good old days when he could, at least before he got sued by the Justice Department, bar Black people from renting his properties. He is angry at a world that dares to proffer a Black woman, an Indian woman, as a serious contender for president. He does not wish to live in this new, emerging America. That’s one of many reasons he should not be elected to lead it."
Half of Trump’s former Cabinet secretaries haven’t backed his 2024 bid,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 10:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/half-trumps-former-cabinet-secretaries-havent-backed-2024-election-rcna165185,"Imagine you were an employer looking to hire someone for your workplace team. You’ve collected some résumé, but to help make a decision, you decide it’s best to check with applicants’ references. After all, to get a sense of how someone would perform on the job, it makes sense to ask those who’ve worked with him/her in the recent past. Then imagine you reach out to an applicant’s former colleagues, and when you ask whether they’d extend their support, nearly half of them hesitate. In fact, some are quite explicit in warning you not to hire the applicant. Would you hire the person anyway? Keep the question in mind when reading the latest Washington Post report on Donald Trump’s former Cabinet officials: By the Post’s count, 42 people, at some point between January 2017 and January 2021, served in Trump’s Cabinet. Based on the latest tally, 24 of them — roughly 57% — are publicly supporting their former boss’s ongoing candidacy. The rest either won’t take a position or have declared publicly that they won’t support the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee. It’s worth emphasizing that the Post’s assessment is rather generous to the former president: Former White House chief of staff John Kelly, for example, has been brutal in his condemnations of Trump, but the newspaper’s official tally lists the retired general as not having taken a firm stand on the former president’s re-election bid. Nevertheless, this is an exceedingly tough dynamic for Republicans to defend. Indeed, one of the reasons I’ve been preoccupied with this angle for quite a while is because it simply has never happened before: Presidents have been known to clash from time to time with individual members of their administrations, but Trump is unique in facing so much opposition from his own team. As ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos recently summarized during an appearance on MSNBC, “His secretary of state called him a ‘moron.’ [Former Defense Secretary James] Mattis says he doesn’t even respect the Constitution. John Kelly says he’s the worst person he ever met. Think about that applying to any other president of the United States at any other time. “Their chief of staff, their defense secretary, their secretary of state, their national security adviser are the ones who had the most damning judgments of his competence and character. That is chilling.” In June, President Joe Biden was equally eager to draw attention to this. “Take it from the people who know Donald Trump best — he is unfit to be president,” the Democratic incumbent concluded. As we discussed last year, members of a White House cabinet have a unique perspective on an American presidency. After a president chooses them for their powerful positions, these cabinet officials routinely work closely with the person behind the desk in the Oval Office, learning first-hand how a president thinks, works, prioritizes, processes information, and leads. I’ve long wondered what might persuade voters inclined to support Trump to change their minds. Who, if anyone, will they listen to? Clearly, these voters will not be persuaded by pundits. Or lawmakers. Or historians. Or prosecutors. Or committee reports. Or special counsel investigations. But perhaps they’ll consider listening to those who worked closely with Trump, and who are now keeping their distance as he tries to regain power. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

"On the politics of electric vehicles, Trump says the quiet part loud",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/politics-electric-vehicles-trump-says-quiet-part-loud-elon-musk-2024-rcna165166,"Donald Trump has been unsubtle in his condemnations of electric vehicles. After taking steps to stymie the industry during his presidency, the Republican added EVs to his party’s list of culture war villains after leaving the White House. Last fall, for example, Trump told an audience that people who own electric cars become “somewhat schizophrenic“ because they can only drive their cars for 10 minutes. Around the same time, he insisted that gas-powered cars are better for the environment than EVs. (They’re not.) In December, the GOP candidate added that electric vehicles don’t “go far” and have to be recharged “every two minutes.” As recently as June, a Washington Post report noted that the Republican nominee “has made bashing EVs a cornerstone of his campaign.” And yet, there’s been an unmistakable shift of late in the former president’s posture. As a recent New York Times report summarized: At an event in Michigan two weeks ago, for example, the Republican said, “I’m constantly talking about electric vehicles but I don’t mean I’m against them. I’m totally for them.” He added that he’s driven EVs “and they are incredible.”Saturday night in Atlanta, Trump went even further, and said the quiet part loud. “I’m for electric cars,” the former president said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. “I have to be, you know, because [Tesla’s Elon Musk] endorsed me very strongly. So, I have no choice.” I’m reminded anew of a recent Politico report with a memorable headline: “Trump keeps flip-flopping his policy positions after meeting with rich people.” As we discussed last week, the list of such incidents keeps growing. It includes TikTok, Anheuser-Busch and the cryptocurrency industry, but Trump’s newfound praise for electric vehicles — he has “no choice” because of Musk — is perhaps the most extraordinary because of the time and effort he invested into telling American consumers not to buy EVs. That is, until he decided they’re “incredible.” Trump pointed to Musk’s endorsement, but it might not be the only consideration. The New York Times recently reported that Musk was “likely” to offer “significant” support for a new pro-Trump super PAC created by Musk’s closest friends. The Wall Street Journal had a related report, noting that the conspiratorial billionaire is prepared to spend “around $45 million a month” in the hopes of putting the Republican back in power. Musk later denied the accuracy of the reporting, though Trump personally suggested that Musk is, in fact, investing $45 million a month in support of his candidacy. The Republican added soon after that he intends to “make life good” for Musk and people like him in a prospective second term. For his part, CNBC reported late last week that the conspiratorial billionaire and his allies are “collecting data in more than a half-dozen swing states” in the hopes of giving Trump a boost. An NBC News report added that a Musk-backed political action committee “has been acquiring detailed voter information from those living in Michigan and other battleground states after people submit their personal data through a section on the PAC’s website that says ‘register to vote.’” The tactics are now under investigation from the Michigan secretary of state’s office and North Carolina's state attorney general's office.

Judge Chutkan already busy on Trump docket after immunity delay,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-chutkan-trump-election-interference-case-rcna165135,"U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is attempting to move Donald Trump’s federal election interference case forward after it returned to her docket Friday. Over the weekend, she denied the former president’s motion to dismiss the case based on “selective and vindictive prosecution” and set a court date for next week. The Obama appointee issued an order on Saturday setting a conference to discuss the case on Aug. 16 (she said Trump doesn’t have to attend). Ahead of that date, she ordered the prosecution and the defense, by Friday, Aug. 9, to “confer and file a status report that proposes, jointly to the extent possible, a schedule for pretrial proceedings moving forward.” Of course, the main event to come is for Chutkan to apply the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling to Trump’s case, to see what’s left of it after the high court announced a new test that at least limits prosecutions against former presidents. To what extent the ruling ultimately curbs special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump remains to be seen. We should get a sense of how the parties want that litigation to proceed by how they lay out their respective positions to Chutkan in the status report this week, after which the judge will decide what happens next in connection with the Aug. 16 conference. The litigation is set against the backdrop of the looming presidential election, whose outcome could determine whether the case continues at all, because Trump will likely get rid of it if he regains the power to do so. Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of Trump’s other federal case, over alleged unlawful retention of classified documents and obstruction, though that appeal won’t likely be fully resolved before the election. As for Trump’s other two criminal cases, the Georgia case is tied up on a pretrial appeal and the New York case is set for sentencing in September unless it’s derailed by immunity-related litigation. (Remember: Presidents can’t dismiss or pardon state charges.) Also on Saturday, Chutkan rejected one of Trump’s claims that doesn’t turn on immunity: that he was selectively and vindictively prosecuted. At the outset, Chutkan took Trump’s lawyers to task for their “improper reframing of the allegations.” She corrected his “alternate narrative” that he was charged for merely disputing the outcome of an election and working with others to propose alternate electors. Rather, the judge noted that he’s charged “with knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.” Chutkan then rejected Trump’s argument that President Joe Biden and the special counsel launched the prosecution to prevent him from retaking the White House. “Finding no evidence of discriminatory purpose in the sources Defendant cites, the court is left only with his unsupported assertions that this prosecution must be politically motivated because it coexists with his campaign for the Presidency,” the judge wrote. Rejecting his vindictive prosecution claim — that he was only charged after he publicly criticized the 2020 election and certain government officials — Chutkan wrote that Trump “has presented no evidence demonstrating a likelihood of vindictiveness.” That long-shot motion wasn’t expected to succeed, and its denial shows Chutkan clearing the decks ahead of a possible trial. Still, whether and when such a trial will happen is unclear. That will partly turn on the outcome of the forthcoming immunity litigation and, perhaps more immediately, November's election. As ever, his best legal defense is becoming president again. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Why Trump’s offensive against Georgia’s Republican governor matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 7:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-offensive-georgias-republican-governor-brian-kemp-2024-election-rcna165156,"About a week ago, Sen. JD Vance appeared on Fox News and assured the public that Donald Trump is not a “vengeful guy.” By all appearances, the Ohio Republican wasn’t kidding — though the comment was unintentionally hilarious to those of us familiar with the former president’s record. Six days after Vance’s on-air declaration, Trump proved his hapless running mate wrong in spectacular fashion. The Associated Press reported: The new offensive against Brian Kemp, Georgia’s incumbent GOP governor, began in earnest on Saturday afternoon, when Trump posted an odd screed to his social media platform. To hear the former president tell it, the governor only won the office because of Trump’s support, and years later, the former president is blaming Kemp for his state’s crime rates and underwhelming economy. The missive went on to call the conservative governor a “bad guy,” who could’ve derailed Trump’s criminal prosecution in the state “with a phone call.” Hours later, the GOP presidential nominee kept going. As a Washington Post report summarized, “Trump mocked him sarcastically and called him ‘Little Brian’; repeatedly called him ‘disloyal’; blamed Kemp for Trump being charged in Georgia by a prosecutor whom Kemp has criticized; suggested Kemp wanted Republicans to lose elections; and argued Georgia would have better crime and economic numbers if Kemp were no longer governor.” That’s really just a sampling. Trump also targeted the governor’s wife and goaded his followers into booing their own home state’s Republican governor. It’d probably be an overstatement to say the 2024 candidate attacked Kemp more than Vice President Kamala Harris, but it was close. Perhaps most importantly, though, the former president singled out the Georgia governor for failing to commit election fraud to benefit him in 2020. It was only natural to wonder why in the world the Republican Party’s presidential nominee would repeatedly attack a GOP governor, in his own competitive state, with three months remaining before Election Day. Indeed, Georgia Republicans were apparently baffled by Trump’s offensive. But the man the public saw on the stage in Atlanta was a familiar figure: Kemp didn’t help Trump cheat four years ago, and he did little to boost his primary candidacy four months ago, so the former president felt justified in throwing a tantrum — indifferent to electoral and/or strategic considerations. For Democrats, the spectacle was notable, not just because of the inherent value in seeing Trump invest so much energy into attacking an ostensible ally, but also because of the larger messaging. The night President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign, someone who works in Democratic politics sent me a text that said a Harris-Trump match-up would be “the future vs the past.” The Republican nominee would be on the ballot for the third consecutive cycle, the argument went, while the Democratic nominee would offer voters something new and exciting, despite being an incumbent vice president. The point was obvious: In a contest between stale and fresh, bet on the latter. It was against this backdrop that Trump went to Atlanta, lied about his 2020 defeat (again), lashed out at local officials (again), targeted an intraparty foe’s spouse (again), recycled derisive nicknames (again), and even congratulated Russia’s Vladimir Putin (again). It’s as if Trump heard about “the future vs the past” framing and decided to help prove the point."
"As Trump backs out of debate with Harris, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 6:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-backs-debate-kamala-harris-what-now-election-2024-rcna165138,"In his imagination, Donald Trump is a man of incredible bravery. In 2018, for example, after a gunman killed 17 people in a Florida high school, the Republican boasted that he would’ve had the courage to run into the school during the mass shooting. In remarks to the nation’s governors, the then-president said at the time, “I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” It was a difficult line to take seriously, but it was a peek into a weird perspective: In Trump’s mind, he’s effectively an action star. People were supposed to believe the septuagenarian president would’ve voluntarily run into an ongoing deadly crisis, where he’d confront a teen armed with an assault rifle, carrying with him nothing but his wits and his bare hands. Trump’s reality, of course, is far different. The former president is better known for promising to take the stand in court cases, only to back down with the pressure on. He’s also the candidate who thought it’d be a good idea to agree to a presidential debate in September, only to ditch the idea when Democrats rallied behind a candidate that scares him. NBC News reported: There were some headlines over the weekend about Trump “agreeing” to debate Harris, but that’s not quite what happened. Rather, what Trump decided to do was back out of a debate he and his team had previously agreed to, while simultaneously proposing a different event, the details of which he prefers. The Republican originally said he’d appear at a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News, without an audience. The GOP nominee has abandoned that commitment, instead saying he’s prepared to appear at a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News, “with a full arena audience.” It’s not altogether clear whether Trump ran this by Fox News — the network had pitched the idea of hosting a possible event on Sept. 17 — though it’s also possible that the former president is working from the assumption that Fox will simply follow his directions. For Harris, all of this is apparently absurd: The incumbent vice president has said she’ll stick to the plan that Team Trump originally agreed to, and she’s asking the former president to honor his commitment. That, evidently, isn’t likely to happen. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping, Trump posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” None of this comes as too big of a surprise. Almost immediately after Biden ended his re-election campaign, the GOP nominee started backing away from a possible debate. On Friday morning, before formally ditching the existing plan, Trump told Fox Business, “I mean, right now I say, why should I do a debate?” At some level, the former president probably realizes this makes him look like a coward, but in the electoral calculus, he’s apparently concluded that it’s better to look weak than show up on a debate stage and look worse. So where does this leave us? While presidential debates have become a common staple in recent decades, in the not-too-distant past, such events were rarities. In the 1964, 1968 and 1972 election cycles, for example, Americans did not see the major-party nominees share a stage. Unless Trump musters the courage to change his mind, 2024 will be a throwback to that bygone era."
"‘Republicans for Harris’ launch features key names, impressive numbers",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-harris-launch-key-names-impressive-numbers-election-2024-rcna165131,"Nine days into her 2024 candidacy, Vice President Kamala Harris picked a couple of notable Republican endorsements: Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan threw his support behind the Democrat fairly quickly, and John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona’s third-largest city, endorsed her soon after. Given the state of the cotemporary GOP, it’s not easy for any Democratic candidate to pick up cross-party backing, so this represented a decent start. But hanging overhead was an obvious question: Would other Republicans soon follow? The question received a rather emphatic answer over the weekend. NBC News reported: Those names are, of course, just a sampling. According to a press statement from the incumbent vice president’s campaign, Republicans for Harris includes endorsements from former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye; former Secretaries Chuck Hagel and Ray LaHood; former Governors Jim Edgar, Bill Weld, and Christine Todd Whitman; former U.S. House members Rod Chandler, Tom Coleman, Dave Emery, Wayne Gilchrest, Jim Greenwood, Adam Kinzinger, John LeBoutillier, Susan Molinari, Jack Quinn, Denver Riggleman, Claudine Schneider, Christopher Shays, Peter Smith, Alan Steelman, David Trott, and Joe Walsh; and former GOP State Chair and State Senator Chris Vance, among others. “As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,” Kinzinger said in a written statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House. Donald Trump poses a direct threat to fundamental American values. He only cares about himself, and his pursuit of power. “That’s what we saw on January 6 when he sent a mob to overturn our lawful election, who violently attacked law enforcement and ransacked our nation’s Capitol in the process,” the former member of the Jan. 6 committee added. “There’s too much at stake to sit on the sidelines, which is why I wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris for president. Now is the time for us all to unite to save our democracy and defeat Donald Trump one last time.” What’s more, the “Republicans for Harris” rollout is apparently about more than simply including names on a list. The Associated Press reported that the program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” using well-known Republicans “to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said.” The list might also yet grow: NBC News’ report noted that Team Harris is especially interested in targeting former Rep. Liz Cheney and former Sen. Jeff Flake. I kept a close eye on this dynamic four years ago and found quite a few GOP partisans — former Republican National Committee chairs, former Republican cabinet secretaries, former Republican governors, and former Republican members of Congress — who publicly expressed support for the Biden-led Democratic ticket. As Election Day 2024 approaches, Harris is well positioned to benefit from similar cross-party support — which Trump will almost certainly lack. Watch this space.

"With Putin, Trump ignores ‘do not congratulate’ advice (again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/putin-trump-ignores-not-congratulate-advice-rcna165128,"In the spring of 2018, relations between the United States and Russia were at a delicate stage. Vladimir Putin’s government had been credibly accused of launching a poison gas assassination attempt on British soil; the White House had just announced sanctions against Russia in response to its attack on our elections; and the Kremlin had just orchestrated a sham election that kept Putin in power. It was against that backdrop that Donald Trump was scheduled to have a telephone meeting with the Russian leader. The then-American president’s national security team prepared briefing materials, directing Trump to condemn the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. As for Putin’s re-election, the same U.S. officials wrote in all capital letters, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE.” It was a message the Republican couldn’t miss. It was, however, a message Trump was prepared to disregard. As regular readers might recall, the then-American president spoke to Putin, ignored his own team, made no mention of the poisoning, and congratulated Putin as if the Russian election had been legitimate. The incident was striking for a variety of reasons, and it made clear that when it comes to his autocratic allies abroad, the Republican likes to issue congratulatory declarations. More than six years later, Trump is still congratulating his benefactor in Moscow. The Washington Post reported: “I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal,” the GOP nominee told a rally audience in Atlanta on Saturday. He added, “We have 59 hostages; I never paid anything. ... Boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals. It’s nice to say we got ’em back, but does that set a bad precedent?” At issue was an incredibly complex diplomatic feat, negotiated between seven countries — some of which don’t get along especially well. Trump’s first instinct was to complain bitterly about the agreement that brought home four U.S. residents who’d been wrongly imprisoned in Russia. His second instinct was to publicly congratulate, not the officials from his own country who negotiated this historic deal, but the head of the adversarial country who improperly imprisoned the U.S. residents in the first place. As for the idea that Trump “never paid anything” to secure Americans’ release, the former president continues to lie about his record, and as the Post’s report added, he “authorized an agreement to pay $2 million to North Korea for medical bills in the release of Otto Warmbier.” Nevertheless, it’s Trump’s public praise for Putin — or more to the point, his latest public praise for Putin — that stands out. Indeed, his new congratulatory message comes on the heels of the Republican pointing to the Russian leader for validation to justify his position on Ukraine. Which came on the heels of the former American president celebrating the fact that Putin was echoing his talking points about the 2024 election and Trump’s multiple criminal indictments. Which came on the heels of Trump telling a Mar-a-Lago audience how “smart” Putin was for invading a neighboring country. Which came on the heels of Trump describing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as “genius” and part of a “wonderful” strategy. Which came on the heels of years’ worth of Trump kowtowing, genuflecting, and repeatedly showing abject weakness toward his Russian ally. U.S. intelligence officials have spent months alerting the public to the fact that the Russian government has launched a “whole-of-government” effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, hoping to return Trump to power. As recently as last week, NBC News reported, “The U.S. intelligence community believes the Kremlin will direct its propaganda efforts to support former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, an intelligence official indicated on a media call Monday.” Let no one wonder why. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why 'We're not going back' is such a powerful statement,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 4:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-delivers-only-response-need-trumps-regressive-messaging-rcna165102,"Less than a week ago, in Atlanta, Vice President Kamala Harris stood in front of 10,000 people; I was told another 10,000 awaited outside the venue, unable to get in. The crowd was jubilant, filled with the kind of hope many Democrats thought had slipped through their fingers this election cycle. Megan Thee Stallion played a compilation of G-rated versions of her songs. A powerful and commanding Harris told the crowd, “Donald Trump is feeling it.” The crowd went wild. She paused for a beat and delivered the coup de grâce: “We are not going back.” This is the first presidential election since the fall of Roe, since women in this country lost the constitutional right to privacy. That right, which we fought so hard to enshrine in the Constitution in 1973, is gone. This means that my daughter has fewer rights than my mother did.  This creates an unusual moment in American history. Namely, many people of color have lived through these kinds of rights reversals before — think of the fall of Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow laws in the South or the internment of Japanese people during World War II or the historical treatment of Native Americans. White women, on the other hand, have largely been protected by the system. In 2016, 46% of white women in America who voted voted for Trump. And their protection ended in 2022 when the conservative majority Supreme Court, enabled by Trump, overturned Roe. Those women, at least the ones who live in red states, now have fewer rights than they did in 2016. They went back.  I’ve written about Harris and the difficulties she faces being the first female vice president, the second Black female senator ever, the first South Asian American to serve in the Senate, the first female African American and first South Asian to be California attorney general. Harris has had to kick down more than a few doors and shatter some glass ceilings. (In fact, the X account RNC Research used a video of her talking about kicking down doors from an AAPI event in May. Presumably the account intended to criticize and embarrass Harris, but the clip hasn’t exactly had that effect.)  Harris achieved things that simply weren’t available to her mother. Her life and career have all been about going forward. On the other hand, Trump’s “Make America great again, again” campaign is all about going backward. And that’s what we should be focusing on this election. Harris’ Atlanta speech sparked a number of conversations with women in my own life. Delaware Senate candidate Lisa Blunt Rochester emailed me about the slogan, writing, “The word WE stands out. WE — the women, communities of color, families, seniors, LGBTQ+ folks, the people of this country — have come so far. Our victories were hard won and well deserved. From protecting the Affordable Care Act to investing in our climate to creating good jobs and so much more. We have come so far, yet there is so much more we can do together, including fighting for our reproductive freedoms and right to vote. Our progress won’t be stopped — and WE will make sure of that when we cast our ballots for Kamala Harris in November.” If Rochester wins her election, she will be only the fourth Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate and the first from Delaware, which means that she, too, will have had to kick down some doors. Former White House communications director and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign director Jennifer Palmieri texted me, “The best campaigns — the ones that really capture and inspire voters — don’t have slogans, they have battle cries that catch on organically. That’s what ‘We will not go back’ is. A sentiment the vice president expressed, that she represents and the crowd chanted back to her. Those are the slogans that get you in the gut.”  I think Palmieri’s idea of “We’re not going back” as a battle cry is salient. But it’s also more than that. Resisting going back is the only sane response to MAGA and its deeply regressive policies. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which Trump disavowed after poor polling but which was at one time thought of as the intellectual hub of Trumpism, would undo a lot of the federal government, including ending the Education Department, which would, at least at the federal level, actively take Americans back to a time when there was no social safety net, when Hoovervilles dotted the landscape.  Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a former civil rights lawyer, texted me, “We’ve been under an ugly orange cloud that defines greatness as a time prior to the civil rights & liberties of all being recognized in this country, so when the VP says we won’t go back, this is what I take her to mean. She wants to move this country forward with Freedom for ALL OF US & I’m with her.” Veteran campaign manager Stuart Stevens always tells me, “Campaigns are about the future.” And how better to message the future than to point out all the many ways Republicans want to take the country, and women’s rights specifically, back?  When Roe was overturned, we American women went back to a time when we didn’t have bodily autonomy, when we couldn’t get lifesaving treatment for ectopic pregnancies. Backward is the very core of this Republican Party right now: backward-facing, uninterested or unwilling to move on from a candidate who is very much stuck in the past. Trump wants America to go back to 2016 when it mistakenly made him president. Harris has given us the perfect response to that agenda. CORRECTION: (Aug. 5, 8:20 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Senate candidate Lisa Blunt Rochester’s state. It’s Delaware, not Maryland."
Transcript: Mystery Man,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/transcript-mystery-man-rcna165108,"Transcript Rachel Maddow Present: Ultra Episode 8: Mystery Man With the backing of an eccentric billionaire and powerful voices on the American far-right, a high-stakes effort to make Sen. Joseph McCarthy president surfaces at the Republican convention, as the years-long manhunt for American fascist Francis Yockey finally reaches its strange and dramatic end. Francis Yockey and Joe McCarthy become martyr figures for an ascendant and aggressive ultra-right intent on reshaping American life and politics for decades to come.

(NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rachel Maddow: He was the richest man in America. Everyone was pretty sure of that, even if no one was exactly sure just how much money he had.  Narrator: Estimates of the value of this empire range $2.5 billion to $3 billion, figures difficult for ordinary mortals to comprehend. Maddow: He was a Texas oil man. And his oil holdings were huge, not just in Texas terms but on an international scale. “Texas Monthly” calculated that, during World War II, his holdings alone produced more oil than Germany, and Italy, and Japan, not the United States altogether, just his oil fields alone.  He was also what you might call eccentric.  Narrator: He has, it appears, only three abiding interests, making money, combating communism in his own way, and enjoying his large family. Maddow: You’ve heard stories about men who somehow found the time to have a second secret family, in addition to the one everyone knew about?  H.L. Hunt, this Texas oil man, he somehow had time to run the largest privately held oil empire in the Western world, and also to have a second secret family, and then also to have a third secret family on top of that.  H.L. Hunt had seven children with his first wife. When she died, he quickly remarried to a secretary from his company. She was raising four children who were supposedly from a previous marriage. But H.L. Hunt soon admitted those four were his children as well.  When he died, yet another woman came forward with four more kids, all of whom he had also fathered and supported in yet a third secret family. And who knows, maybe there were more someplace else. But there were at least those three families, two of them secret, and at least those 15 children.  His eldest child, a son, he had sent for a lobotomy for the destruction of part of his brain, a crippling so-called treatment for some poorly understood mental condition. H.L. Hunt himself had a fifth-grade education.  He was devoted to the idea that the best form of exercise, the only truly natural form of exercise, was crawling, crawling around on the floor like a baby, which he did every day, fully dressed in a shirt and tie, including on several occasions in front of reporters.  He called it creeping. He shouted to a Dallas Morning News reporter -- quote -- “I’m a crank about creeping.” H.L. Hunt believed that even Republican presidents, including Herbert Hoover and Dwight D. Eisenhower, were socialists, if not communists. After General Douglas MacArthur was fired during the Korean War for disobeying orders from the commander-in-chief, H.L. Hunt supported him, MacArthur, for President in 1952.  He was also becoming increasingly devoted to U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy. By then, H.L. Hunt had also started his own media empire.  Narrator: The dissemination of right-wing educational materials, as he calls them. Maddow: A low-profile, but fast-growing network of radio shows and TV shows and syndicated columns and newsletters.  Announcer: It’s “Facts Forum” time.  Maddow: At the launch of a H.L. Hunt TV program called “Facts Forum,” he hired a new staffer from the office of Senator Joe McCarthy, a young staffer who would soon become McCarthy’s wife. McCarthy himself was the first guest on the show. Announcer: A program designed and presented to interest you in a subject of vital national importance. Maddow: Reporters soon noticed that a majority of the programming on Hunt’s various broadcasts was dedicated to promoting McCarthy: plugging his speeches, bringing on other guests to say how great he was.  Narrator: Hunt spends millions each year in spreading his religious, super patriotic messages. He is a strong advocate of right-wing causes and is considered by some to be a serious threat to American institutions. Maddow: In politics, it is no small thing to have the support of the richest man in the country, even if he is a little eccentric, especially if that man controls media outlets that echo and reinforce and amplify his support.  But Joe McCarthy’s support wasn’t just from eccentric right-wing billionaires like H.L. Hunt.  Radio anchor: McCarthy will jump into the fray with a battle cry that the fight on communism must not be hindered, and he will have support. Maddow: In the lead-up to the 1956 presidential election, a group described as nationalists, including former Congressman Hamilton Fish, former Senator Burton Wheeler, Chicago Tribune publisher Robert McCormick, they all met at the Harvard Club in New York City to plot the next step up for Joe McCarthy. Congressman Fish emerged from that meeting to tell the press that McCarthy would achieve the presidency in 1956, even if he had to do it with an independent or a third-party bid.  By that time, McCormick’s group, For America, had been promoting a wild election gambit, to qualify their own electors in multiple states to try to insert chaos into the count of the Electoral College.  Clarence Manion, Radio Commentator: We can get our wish by qualifying a slate of American presidential elector candidates in our respective states. In a number of states, patriots are already far advanced on these necessary prerequisites. Maddow: To win the presidency without becoming the nominee of either major party, you’d need a gambit like that, because, of course, under normal electoral processes, it’s all but impossible for any third-party candidate to win, whether it would be McCarthy, or an anti-income tax candidate they also liked, or a Dixiecrat segregationist, or anyone else.  But even conservative columnists were sounding the alarm that, if anyone could do something like that, if anyone could pull it off, it would be McCarthy -- quote -- “McCarthy will have no compunctions at all about wrecking the Republican Party if this seems to serve his purposes. McCarthy has plenty of financial backing. He has important support in the press and on the radio. His supporters have the true mark of the fanatic. They are not interested in facts. The endless exposure of McCarthy’s endless untruths do not affect them.  His opportunities to stay in the news are unlimited. Can McCarthy reach the White House? Serious observers on Capitol Hill take seriously the possibility that McCarthy could ride to national power on the wreckage of the Republican Party. The idea does seem fantastic at first glance. But McCarthy has been consistently underrated. And this has been one of his greatest assets.”  With loud static like that coming from the far right, by the time the 1956 Republican National Convention loomed... Anchor: From San Francisco’s Cow Palace, the NBC radio coverage of the 1956 Republican National Convention. Maddow: …the Republican Party writ large determined that they would renominate Eisenhower and that there would be no convention shenanigans to get in the way of that.  Reporter: As the nation waits for the opening sound of the gavel, indications are that the convention will carry out its main purpose smoothly and efficiently. Maddow: Smoothly and efficiently. That was the idea. McCarthy’s devotees did not want to oblige.  Day three of the Republican National Convention, headline: “Dump Eisenhower Move Appears at Convention.” A so-called Conservative Republican Headquarters opens up on Market Street in San Francisco, not far from the official convention proceedings at the Cow Palace. They’re distributing anti-Eisenhower pamphlets and pins. They’ve got a petition with a hundred thousand names on it. They’re recruiting delegates at the convention to their cause.  The activists there, including a young man by the name of Willis Carto, tell reporters their plan. They just need one convention delegate to start it, maybe a delegate from the South who doesn’t like how soft Eisenhower is on segregation. That delegate will pry open this convention by putting forward the name Joe McCarthy for the nomination. They’ll start an open convention. They’ll start a fight.  One columnist points out to the activists that McCarthy isn’t even there in San Francisco. He isn’t even at the convention. The activists brush this off -- quote -- “If he’s nominated, we can get him to fly here at a moment’s notice.”  It’s a good try. It’s an earnest try. But Joe McCarthy isn’t flying in to anywhere. And Eisenhower’s not budging off the Republican ticket, because the movement that has built itself around Joe McCarthy is about to outlive him.  Within days, it will be clear that Eisenhower will have the nomination.  Within five months, Eisenhower will be sworn in for a second term. And within nine months...  NBC Anchor: The news in brief, Wisconsin’s controversial Senator Joseph R. McCarthy is dead. McCarthy died at Bethesda Naval Hospital here about an hour ago from a liver ailment. Maddow: Joe McCarthy has drunk himself to death at the age of 48.  Among the things that will make it into McCarthy’s instant obituary the night of the shocking news of his death is his defense of the Nazis involved in the Malmedy massacre.  Anchor: There are those in this country who will see in his passing the loss to the nation of a great patriot. Then there are those who rejected this description and saw in Mr. McCarthy not a red hunter, but a headhunter. Several times, he seemed about to burst out of the relative obscurity of just another member of the Senate, notably when he came to the defense of Germans held involved in the ghastly World War II Malmedy massacres. The quiet, droning quality of his voice, boring into witnesses before his Senate committee, became known everywhere on this globe, known and imitated. His actions were cited by foreign governments, to the detriment of this country. He was soundly blasted here at home, but he had millions upon millions of devoted followers.  Maddow: Millions of devoted followers, who, it turns out, were all but inconsolable when he died.  Far-right preacher Gerald L.K. Smith suggested that McCarthy might have been murdered, or at least targeted fatally somehow by his opponents. He said a secret and Satanic campaign had been launched to -- quote -- “tax the resistance of the mind, the nerve and glandular system” of Senator McCarthy.  The neo-Nazi group the National Renaissance Party, which had started calling themselves Patriots for McCarthy, they went into full-blown mourning, holding annual requiem masses for Joe McCarthy in New York. They held them annually for years.  Radio host Clarence Manion, who had been the voice of that For America electoral vote scheme, he said McCarthy had been spectacularly martyred. Manion: Many years from now, readers of history may wonder why President Eisenhower did not use the spectacular martyrdom of McCarthy as an example of communist ruthlessness. David Austin Walsh, Historian: There’s something to the idea that McCarthy is this martyr figure who is embraced by conservative Americans across that sort of right-wing political spectrum as a martyr figure. Maddow: Historian David Austin Walsh.  McCarthy biographer Richard Rovere said that McCarthy was -- quote -- “in many ways, the most gifted demagogue ever bred on these shores. No bolder seditionist ever moved among us, nor any politician with a surer, swifter access to the dark places of the American mind.”  On those terms, Joe McCarthy had set in motion something that did not stop when he died, when he died so suddenly and so young.  Anchor: The Capitol, shocked by the suddenness of the death of Senator McCarthy, is piecing together the story only now. Maddow: Rovere described “the world of the daft and the frenzied, the compulsive haters who had followed earlier and lesser demagogues in the fascist and semi-fascist movements of the ‘30s and ‘40s.”  He said McCarthy had certainly locked up the support of that world, but he also greatly enlarged that world by adding to it -- quote -- “large numbers of regular Republicans who had coolly decided that there was no longer any respectable way of un-horsing the Democrats and that only McCarthy’s wild and conscienceless politics could do the job.”  In the wake of McCarthy’s death, that mix, wild and without conscience, would show itself, and soon, right there in San Francisco, where the FBI was finally about to get its man.  This is the final episode of “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Reporter: We’re coming up onto Geary Street now, and I can see the Saint Francis Hotel, and confetti is flying out into the air. Anthony Mostrom, Journalist: They could see that there was a little bit of evidence of burning on his lips. Manion: The spectacular martyrdom of McCarthy, an example of communist ruthlessness Thruston Morton, Republican National Committee Chairman: I have been asked if I think the election was stolen. My comment is this. Many people do.  Mostrom: He was standing in the kitchen trying to remain calm, kind of knowing that the jig was up. ******************************** Maddow: Episode 8: “Mystery Man.”  Narrator: This is the route of the flagships of American Airlines, serving 21 states from border to border, from coast to coast… Maddow: Wayne Kemp was working for American Airlines as a ticket clerk at Carter Field, the main airport in Fort Worth, Texas. It was a Friday afternoon, June 1960. During his shift that day, Wayne noticed a stray piece of luggage that had apparently been separated from its owner.  Nobody had come to pick it up. Maybe it had been overlooked and left behind on a connecting flight.  It was a really generic-looking suitcase: a large, gray Samsonite bag with no I.D. tag. But the airlines have protocols for these things, and so Wayne Kemp did what he was trained to do. He made doubly sure that no one was there in Fort Worth to claim it and then he took it aside and he carefully opened it to see if there was any identification inside.  The first thing he found was a passport. And that seemed like good news. Obviously, a passport would provide some identifying information. But the second thing he found was another passport. And then he found another one. Three passports from three different countries, all three with the same photo, but with three different names.  There were also credit cards, and travelers checks, and checkbooks, and driver’s licenses, and German press credentials, and seven different birth certificates, all with different names.  Ticket clerk Wayne Kemp called the FBI.  Tracing where the luggage had come from, which was New Orleans and where it seemed to have been heading to, which was California, the Dallas FBI agents got in touch with the FBI field office in San Francisco. The airline told them that, yes, in fact, a passenger had just landed in California and had reached out to them looking for his lost bag.  The passenger gave the name Richard Hatch. He told them he was staying in Oakland. The FBI told the airline to contact the man again and tell him to stay put: “Don’t go anywhere. We’ll bring the bag to you.” Soon, that gray Samsonite suitcase was on its way to an address in Oakland, along with a car full of special agents from the FBI, because the owner of that luggage, the man calling himself Richard Hatch, was someone the U.S. government had been searching for, for more than a decade.  It was American fugitive Francis Parker Yockey.  The agents waited for Yockey at the address he’d given. He told them his name was Richard Hatch. He said he was a photographer. He said he was living mostly in Mexico. They asked him to open the bag. At first, he expressed surprise at all these passports inside, all these birth certificates, these different forms of I.D., all in different names.  As the agents started to question him more aggressively, Yockey got tense. He finally conceded that he had known that the passports and the documents were there, but he said there was a logical explanation for it. The agents would later file in their report that Yockey said he refused to give them that logical explanation -- quote -- “on the basis that he would be misunderstood.”  As the grilling intensified, one of the FBI agents later wrote in the report that he noticed the man -- quote -- “moving toward the door.”  The agent asked him if he wanted to sit down, but he said, no, that he would rather stand. And then, with these FBI agents standing just a few feet away, he bolted.  Mostrom: Yockey was standing in the kitchen of this little duplex trying to remain calm, kind of knowing that the jig was up, and an FBI agent was keeping his eye on Yockey, when Yockey suddenly bolted out the door and attempted to run down the stairway and take off.  Maddow: That’s journalist Anthony Mostrom.  Yockey bolted out of the apartment. An agent leapt after him in pursuit. Yockey slammed the door on that agent’s hand, cutting it open. The agent would end up needing 28 stitches. Yockey ran down a back staircase. He started making a break for it down the street. Another agent came rushing out of the front door, and tackled him. Got him.  Yockey was put under arrest after more than a decade on the run, after going AWOL to avoid questioning about the Nazi sabotage plot in the U.S. during World War II. Anchor: They brought with them a great store of explosives. Maddow: After flipping against the American government to help the Nazis in Germany at the Nazi war crimes trials. Reporter: All of the defendants have been taken out of the courtroom. Maddow: After fleeing Army counterintelligence to go to Ireland to write his fascist book, “Imperium,” after hooking up with escaped Nazis in South America and trying to sell black market plans for a cobalt bomb in the Middle East. Drew Pearson, Journalist: The radioactive dust would reach California in about a day. Maddow: After somehow eluding years of FBI surveillance including while he spoke at segregationist, antisemitic U.S. rallies and wrote a speech for Senator Joe McCarthy. Fmr. Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-WI): Communists or worse. Maddow: After all that, Francis Yockey was finally in custody.  And then, because of course, things got even weirder.  His arrest was front-page news in the Bay Area.  Mostrom: The San Francisco Chronicle’s front page blared out “Mystery Man Seized With Three Passports. Passport Subject Called Top Fascist.”  Maddow: The mystery man seized with fake passports. It -- quote -- “caused the wires to hum between here and Washington last night.” Quote -- “‘This is definitely a security matter,’ a government spokesman said. Both the State Department and the Department of Justice are interested in this man. One government source said last night: ‘This is not a small fish. This is a man that we are very, very interested in.’” A photo of Yockey handcuffed in custody appeared in the papers, as reporters there started trying to piece it together. Yockey soon had a series of court appearances.  Mostrom: The reporters who covered Yockey’s bail hearing in a San Francisco courtroom described a sullen, silent mystery man with an odd stare. Maddow: At his bail hearing, prosecutors cited -- quote -- “the unusual circumstances of this case” in making a bail request that was extraordinarily high. They asked for $50,000 bail, more than half-a-million dollars in today’s money.  The FBI said they didn’t want to go into detail about the case and the bail request, telling reporters only -- quote -- “There are lots of questions that haven’t been answered and we want him around.”  The judge overseeing the bail hearing told the government -- quote -- “I don’t know what you may have in your minds, but to justify this kind of bail, you’re going to have to make a case on the record.”  The federal prosecutor handling the hearing was William P. Clancy. He said that the U.S. attorney’s office had been instructed by Washington to not say anything more. Prosecutors did tell the judge that the high bail was indicative of the government’s great interest in the man. They also explained that they’d found him with a weapon in the first cell that they put him in, a comb with all the teeth removed and the end sharpened.  The prosecutor, William Clancy, told the court that Yockey was -- quote -- “an extreme risk of flight.”  And maybe he was.  You don’t accumulate three passports and seven birth certificates all in different names without some kind of weird resources. Prosecutors then told the judge that they had learned of an escape plot. In the San Francisco jail, Yockey had approached another prisoner who was being held on a $1,000 bail. Yockey had had more than twice that amount on him in cash when he was arrested.  He told the prisoner that he’d pay for his bail if the man would then get a gun once he was out. Yockey told him he should hide in Dunbar Alley, where the U.S. Marshals picked up prisoners from the jail to take them for their federal court hearings. When the Marshals brought Yockey out of the jail, the man was supposed to ambush them, so Yockey and another prisoner could make a run for it.  Unfortunately for Yockey, the prisoners who he approached about this plan went straight to the FBI. After the escape plan was exposed, Yockey was moved to a new cell. He was searched thoroughly for anything that could be used as a weapon, for anything that could be used in a suicide attempt.  FBI records show jailhouse informants telling them that Yockey bragged that he had plenty of money from something involving all those forged passports, from something involving Egypt. One informant remembered him using the word “Suez.”  Informants told the FBI that Yockey -- quote -- “expressed admiration for the late Senator Joseph McCarthy.”  While he was in jail, prosecutors and the FBI and other interested government agencies were awkwardly negotiating among themselves and with Washington about who was allowed to know what about this case and about this man.  In an FBI memo that is still heavily redacted today, an FBI special agent in charge is described as having received some important information about Yockey on the night of June 16, 1960, while Yockey was still in the San Francisco jail -- quote -- “Special Agent in Charge Auerbach, on the evening of June 16, received the following information: ‘Blank. Blank related that blank reportedly has a complete file pertaining to blank, which contains considerable information that is in conflict with other information received to date. Blank. In view of the source of the aforementioned information, this data should not be disseminated to other agencies, and not discussed with personnel outside the bureau.”  Then the memo continues -- quote -- “Assistant U.S. Attorney Clancy,” the prosecutor in Yockey’s case, “indicated during the evening of June 16 that he had come into the possession of a -- quote -- ‘super secret’ file regarding Yockey, which was -- quote -- ‘dynamite.’” It is noted that Special Agent Blank and Blank were planning to contact Assistant U.S. attorney Clancy during the afternoon of June 17 to determine the nature of the aforementioned file. So, on the night of June 16, with Yockey in jail, the FBI learns that someone has a -- quote -- “complete file” on Yockey that the bureau is concerned should not be shared with other agencies. That same night, the prosecutor handling Yockey’s case tells the FBI that he has obtained a super secret file on Yockey, which he calls dynamite. It is not an FBI file.  The FBI, in fact, makes plans to get its hands on that file the following day. But the following day, June 17, the whole case changes fatally. Guards come to Yockey’s cell to wake him for breakfast. They find him lying on his cot arms crossed, nonresponsive. There are no visible injuries that the guards can see, except for what looks like it might be a chemical burn on his lips.  Mostrom: They could see that there was a little bit of evidence of burning on his lips, which told them right away that he had probably taken something, taken poison, like Hermann Goering and all the Nuremberg defendants, you know, before him. Maddow: Yockey had just been moved to a new cell and thoroughly searched days earlier. There were no bottles or containers or envelopes found in his cell. But, somehow, he had got ahold of a capsule of cyanide, which did have an echo of Nuremberg.  Reporter: Wilhelm Hermann Goering, guilty on four counts, escaped his fate of hanging by committing suicide less than three hours before he would have been executed, taking cyanide of potassium. Maddow: The newspapers soon reported strange details about Yockey’s death. He was found lying on his cot in his underwear and in a pair of -- quote -- “storm trooper-style boots,” which raises the question, among other things, how? How did he manage to get storm trooper-style boots in jail, and how did he get the poison? How did any of this happen? Mostrom: He did manage to obtain potassium cyanide, and that, of course, is one of the enduring mysteries of the Yockey saga. Who slipped him the cyanide? Maddow: It’s worth noting that Francis Yockey did have one final visitor from the outside just before his death, a man who came to see him at the jail.  Mostrom: Yockey received one visitor that we know of in the San Francisco jail. And that was an obscure right-wing activist and publisher named Willis Carto. Maddow: Willis Carto. The same Willis Carto who had helped lead the doomed effort to get Joe McCarthy nominated for president at the Republican Convention in San Francisco. Reporter: We’re coming up onto Geary Street now, and I can see the Saint Francis Hotel, and confetti is flying out into the air. Maddow: When Willis Carto wasn’t trying to get a soon-to-be-dead Joe McCarthy onto the Republican presidential ticket he had been busy in ways that kept catching the eye of the FBI.  There was the German American Bund leader who had been arrested and imprisoned after he was found to be linked to the Operation Pastorius Nazi sabotage plot during World War II. When he got out of prison and FBI agents paid him a visit, they found that he had started a new pro-Joe McCarthy group in the Midwest, and that his new Nationalist Conservative Party was listed in a directory of far-right groups that was assembled by Willis Carto.  The FBI had infiltrated the neo-Nazi National Renaissance Party in New York, which was publishing Yockey’s antisemitic essays, and which Yockey himself had joined under one of his aliases. Willis Carto was in correspondence with the group’s leader, James Madole, exchanging complaints about white people -- quote -- “standing at the gateway of racial extinction.” Carto was in correspondence with segregationist leaders organizing support for federal legislation that had been put forward by America First Senator Bill Langer, a bill that proposed to round up Black Americans and send them to Africa.  When groups advocating for that bill came under suspicion in connection with a series of anti-Black and anti-Jewish bombings in the American south, Carto was interviewed about his ties to anyone who might have been involved. The FBI also asked Carto whether he knew the whereabouts of a man named Francis Yockey.  And so, when San Francisco papers erupted with the news of this mysterious fascist, this man Yockey who had turned up at the San Francisco jail, Willis Carto knew enough to know that he had to meet him. Carto wrote about attending one of Yockey’s court hearings as if he had come face to face with a god -- quote -- “As his gaze swept across, and then to me, he stopped and, for the space of a fractional second, spoke to me with his eyes. In that instant, we understood that I would not desert him.”  Carto then wrangled a private visit with Yockey in jail.  Mostrom: “Dimly, I could make out the form of this man, this strange and lonely man, through the thick wire netting. I knew that I was in the presence of a great force and I could feel history standing aside me.”  Maddow: Oh, get a room.  Willis Carto’s jailhouse meeting with Yockey came under the guise of an antisemitic, pro-segregation newsletter he was publishing that was called “Right.”  When Yockey turned up dead, Carto claimed in his newsletter that Yockey’s death should be blamed, of course, on the Jews -- quote -- “Convinced that only his dynamic philosophy of cultural vitalism could save the white race, he went to Brittas Bay, Ireland, in 1948. Isolated, he wrote ‘Imperium,’ a book which will live 1,000 years.”  Carto said -- quote -- “From the moment of publication of this book, his doom was sealed, for it must have become apparent to international Jewry at that time that Yockey had to be destroyed.” Carto would soon begin reprinting and selling “Imperium.” It had previously been almost impossible to get only a few hundred copies published in England in the 1940s. But under Willis Carto, “Imperium” would be available as a cheap paperback with an eye-catching cover and a long new introduction by Carto praising the book, praising Yockey as the salvation of the Western world and the White race.  Mostrom: Carto was completely converted to it. He sold “Imperium” by mail for years and years through his newspaper, “The Spotlight.”  Maddow: Willis Carto soon founded something called Liberty Lobby. He began publishing a newspaper for it called “The Spotlight.”  Within ten years, the Liberty Lobby would be one of the most aggressive and effective far-right political pressure groups in the country “The Spotlight” would be the highest-circulation right-wing publication in America, by far.  All the while, as Willis Carto’s organizations and publications rose in influence in Republican and conservative politics, he would stay true to what he had decided in 1960 would be his life’s mission, to carry on the legacy and the message of his hero, Francis Yockey.  But, in 1960, in the immediate aftermath of Yockey’s death, there was more to do. With McCarthy gone and Yockey gone, and both of them mourned and celebrated as martyrs, the movement they had both been part of and built and left behind, it had something else to offer American politics and this so-called democracy that kept failing them again and again.  The conclusion of “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra” is next.  ******************************** It should have been clear on election night, when the Republican candidate’s supporters refused to accept the results. It’s November 1960. The country is gripped by a nail-biter, down-to-the-wire presidential election between the Democrat, John F. Kennedy, and Republican Richard Nixon.  It’s around 3:00 a.m. on election night. And as it’s finally starting to become clear that Nixon has lost -- by a thin margin, but he’s lost -- Nixon goes out to talk to his supporters. He wants to let them down gently.  Richard Nixon, Presidential Candidate: As I look at the board here, while the -- there are still some results still to come in, if the present trend continues, Mr. Kennedy, Senator Kennedy, will be the next president of the United States  (CROWD YELLS NO!) Maddow: In any presidential campaign, especially on election night, passions run hot. Sometimes, it’s harder for supporters to accept defeat than even for the candidate himself. Nixon knows that.  But he also knows the math. He knows it’s over.  And so, following that initial reaction from his supporters, that chorus of “No, no, no” that had just rained down on him, Nixon tries again. He thanks the crowd for their enthusiasm and their support, but he wants to assure the country, he wants to assure the incoming president-elect that he and his supporters will accept the election’s results.  Nixon: I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard-fought, as this one is hard-fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected. I want all of you to know... (SHOUTING) Nixon: I want all of -- I want -- I... (APPLAUSE) Nixon: I want -- I want Senator Kennedy to know and I want all of you to know that, certainly, if this trend does continue and he does become our next president, that he will have my wholehearted support and yours too.  (BOOING) Maddow: In that moment, it might have been clear where all of this was heading  In the immediate aftermath of that very-closely-contested election, Willis Carto decided it was time to debut the new national publication of his group, Liberty Lobby. The mailing list was surprisingly large. Carto had always been good at that logistical side of his organizing.  But where his previous newsletter had been targeted to an extreme right-wing audience, with screeds against Jewish people and racial mongrelization and all-but-explicit endorsements of Nazism, this new publication, “The Liberty Letter,” would aim for a more mainstream audience, a more mainstream Republican audience.  And there was good reason now, a good hook, for rushing out this first issue just after the election. Republicans needed to know that this election had been stolen, or at least it was in the process of being stolen, but there was a way to stop it, to stop the steal.  This was the big headline from Carto, page one: “Kennedy Has Not Won the Election.”  He explained that the votes apparently cast for Kennedy had been fraud, that the fraud could and would be proven, but, in the meantime electors in the contested states, for example, from Georgia, those electors should not be counted for Kennedy under any circumstances.” Carto wrote: “Unless some action is shown at once, Kennedy will claim the White House.” Quote: “Will no one stop them?”  Carto said a mass mobilization on the right could prevent the transfer of power to Kennedy. He wrote: “This urgent event can happen between now and January.” The electors plot that they had promoted, but never tried in 1956, they should actually do it now in this next election, in 1960.  And Carto would not be alone. The cause would soon be joined by Gerald L.K. Smith.  Gerald L.K. Smith, Preacher: God, let me be a rabble-rouser! Maddow: Gerald L.K. Smith, the antisemitic far-right preacher, blasted out a message to his followers, that at that very moment he was in discussions with -- quote -- “governors, congressmen, judges, and crusading patriots” about reversing the results of the election.  He said he was working -- quote -- “to persuade at least four Southern Governors to assert their leadership in this crisis moment in world history.”  Specifically, Smith was telling governors to change the results in their states, to send Nixon electors to Washington, even though Kennedy had won the vote in those states. He said the -- quote -- “campaign of pressure” he was overseeing would persuade Republican elected officials all across the country that they could overturn the election results in their states to -- quote -- “save the nation.”  Smith told his followers he had rock-solid evidence that Kennedy -- quote -- “stole the election.” Quote -- “Convincing evidence concerning thievery in numerous states is being assembled.”  He called it “a deadly moment in American history,” but he said it could all be stopped if they mobilized together. The election may be done, the votes may be in, but the result hasn’t been finalized, so it isn’t over. There’s still a way to stop it, in Washington, in Congress, when the Electoral College votes are cast, and when they’re counted in the first week of January. That’s where they could stop it.  Gerald L.K. Smith and Willis Carto, one who had campaigned for president on a platform of sterilizing and deporting all Jewish people from America, one who would be the publisher and most fervent evangelist for America’s “Mein Kampf,” both brought into electoral politics through their allegiance to the same shockingly powerful, deeply flawed Washington demagogue, now they’re working together to try to discard the democratic process and its outcomes, to throw out the results of an election.  The Nixon campaign and the Republican Party, which had effectively conceded the race already, they nevertheless had their heads turned by this new effort led by the Republican Party chairman.  Morton: I have been asked if I think the election was stolen. My comment is this. Many people do. And many people have come to me with examples of fraud and irregularity. It’s my responsibility to investigate. Where there’s so much smoke, I must look for the fire. Maddow: “Many people do” believe the election was stolen.  The Republican Party chairman vowed that he would leave -- quote -- “no stone unturned” in investigating all of this supposed fraud.  Morton: I have also been asked who I think will be the next president of the United States. I predict an inauguration will take place on January 20th, and, of course, I feel that it will be Jack Kennedy, although, as always, the possibility that enough states may be overturned in the recount to negate what we think today are the election results. Maddow: Yes, we know how this is going to turn out, but what’s the harm? What’s the harm in just indulging these stolen election fantasies just a little bit? There’s always the possibility.  In the end, of course, it didn’t work. JFK was sworn in as president. There was an uninterrupted peaceful transfer of power. But that move, that move after that election to stop the steal, to call the election results false, to try to get election officials to overturn the results, in some ways, it was a kind of flag on the timeline, a bullet point reminder of what happens when fundamentally antidemocratic forces get brought in to work their dark magic in real politics.  If you come from a world where democracy is not your preferred choice. If, for example, you think we should have fought on the other side in World War II. If you come from a world where there are whole groups of other Americans who you think should be sterilized, or deported, or exterminated. Let’s be honest, you’re not all that excited about casting your vote alongside those Americans with everyone as equal citizens.  If you have told yourself that Jewish people or some other cabal secretly controls everything and what appears to be democracy is really a sham, then what do you care about the product of that democracy? What do you care about election results?  And if you believe those things, but you’re a lonely crank on the fringe shouting at a cloud about it, well, knock yourself out.  But if you’re invited in, if you, Gerald L.K. Smith, are invited to the Senate to bring your fake story about the Jewish Defense Department official Anna Rosenberg being a secret communist. If you, Eustace Mullins, author of “The Biological Jew,” is invited to supply anti-communist research for a senator’s staff. If you, the uniformed storm troopers of the National Renaissance Party, are to host the senator for his speech which will be written for him by the author of America’s “Mein Kampf.” If innocent American G.I.s are to face sheafs of made-up antisemitic cartoon caricature horror stories shipped direct to Capitol Hill from Munich from a leader of Germany’s successor Nazi party.  If violent forces that seek the end of the American system of government are tapped and brought in to electoral politics, there’s no reason to expect that what happens next will be constrained by respect for election results.  There have always been some Americans who liked the idea of other systems of government better than ours, who admired foreign dictators and authoritarians, who wanted something like that here, a system with their own strongman, with them on top, and everybody else can finally just shut up, or face the consequences.  Americans with ideas like these have flocked to movements like America First, which tried to keep us from fighting the Nazis. They have flocked to demagogues like Joseph McCarthy and others, politicians who understood the kind of dark wells they were drawing from, and they liked it, politicians who stayed themselves mostly in electoral politics, but they drew in and cultivated and used the menace of the persistently and legitimately antidemocratic forces in our country to give the movement around them not just a thrillingly transgressive vibe, but a real air of menace, a real air of threat.  Activating the real radicals, radicalizing the normies, causing real fear among Americans who would oppose them or stand in their way.  These politicians’ followers don’t much care about the electoral program of the politician they embrace. They don’t much care about deficit spending or relations with China or whether he actually exposes any real communists, or whether he cheats on his wife or on his taxes or on them in what always seems to be a constant grift.  What they care about is that he’s powerful. He’s willing to be brutal, and crude and mean. He does instill fear. He doesn’t shrink from violence. He colors outside the lines without guilt or hesitation. He’s uncontrollable, unstoppable, unshameable. That appeals, because that means he will break this system.  That is the appeal. That’s the whole idea.  You don’t take down a figure like that by pointing out his hypocrisies and his policy shortcomings. You take him down by stopping him from doing what he’s trying to do, by showing that he can’t actually break the American system of government, because, look, there it is holding firm against him, showing his followers that he’s not superhuman, he’s not stronger than how this country was built.  The American system of government, our democracy and our rule of law is far from perfect. But it is the kind of system that, when it works well, it works against cheats and frauds and violent thugs.  And so, against a man and a movement arrayed against the American system of government, it takes Americans in government and inside the American system to push back hard, like senators, Tydings, Benton, Flanders, Hunt.  It takes Americans in the free press like Drew Pearson and Marquis Childs.  These Americans did nothing particularly inventive to fight Joe McCarthy. They were just brave enough to actually fight him. And it didn’t seem like it was working at the time. And it was costly to all of them. And it took all of them, but it worked.  Baldwin calling out McCarthy’s lies on Malmedy. Tydings calling out McCarthy’s lies on communists in government. That put both of them in the firing line for McCarthy, and they both paid for it with their careers. But the record they built of those lies became the basis for the expulsion resolution against McCarthy from Benton.  And that put Benton on the firing line for McCarthy too, and he too paid with his career. But Benton’s expulsion resolution exposed more about McCarthy. It exposed his financial corruption, which McCarthy couldn’t answer to and refused to answer to.  And that mattered, because when Lester Hunt stood up next, threatening the immunity McCarthy depended on to operate the way he did, the resultant blackmail drive against Hunt led to Hunt’s death.  And that put enough steel in the spines, barely enough, but enough, for Republicans to finally support taking some kind of stand. And, yes, it was barely half of them, and it was none of the so-called leaders. But it was enough.  And that weak censure, that condemnation, that little rules and decorum violation they finally barely felt brave enough to get him on, what that was technically about was his refusal to face questions about that evidence of his financial corruption that had turned up because of the old expulsion resolution that hadn’t seemed to go anywhere, that hadn’t seemed, at the time, to matter. Until, in the end, it did. It all added up.  No one blow was enough, but, together, they all were.  McCarthy’s biographer, Richard Rovere, wrote that McCarthy’s decline -- quote -- “was more difficult to account for than his ascent. He suffered defeats, but not destruction. Nothing of a really fatal consequence had happened.” But, still, he said -- quote -- “He collapsed.”  It’s never going to be just one blow that takes down the demagogue. It’s going to take more than that. It’s going to take 10 blows, or 100. But not a million. The American system of government is strong, too. It just needs brave Americans to believe that and to show it and to step up, despite the costs.  Willis Carto did go on to decades of influence on the American right. His group Liberty Lobby had a big office on Capitol Hill. It had the largest-circulation right-wing publication in the country for years. It had its staffers and advisers promoted for government positions in multiple Republican administrations.  All the while, Carto kept the flame burning for Francis Yockey and what Yockey stood for. Drew Pearson dogged Carto for years, reporting relentlessly on his extremism. Carto kept suing Drew Pearson to try to get him to stop, but he lost every case. Pearson never gave up.  Willis Carto died in 2015. At his death, he was remembered as having done more than any other American in history to promote and spread the lie that is Holocaust denial.  Thanks to Carto’s devotion to the cause, Francis Yockey’s book “Imperium” never did go out of print. And it seems like it’s newly discovered every few years now by some new iteration of the very far right.  In 1998, in Jasper, Texas, a Black man named James Byrd Jr. was chained to the bumper of a pickup truck and dragged to his death in a horrific hate crime. Three white supremacists were arrested and convicted. And then there, at the sentencing, was the name Francis Yockey again.  Jackson: At the sentencing of one of the murderers, he quoted Francis Parker Yockey to justify his own actions. So, you know, it’s still out there. It’s still being read. Maddow: At a Vatican conference, when Republican presidential campaign manager and senior White House adviser Steve Bannon cited an Italian fascist named Julius Evola, it set off a wave of excitement across the very far right.  In most recent reprints of Yockey’s “Imperium,” and there are many, it’s Julius Evola’s glowing review of “Imperium” that is included as an afterword with the book.  Mostrom: It’s very evident that there are people in power who have read “Imperium” and take its neo-fascist message very seriously. Maddow: Francis Yockey’s peculiar anti-American vision of destroying a multiracial democratic United States, to instead make us a white, fascist nation in league with Russia, it was weird in 1948. It was still weird in 2017, at Charlottesville.  Charlottesville Ralliers: Russia is our friend! The South will rise again! Russia is our friend! The South will rise again!  Maddow: There’s a so-called Dark Enlightenment antidemocratic philosophy that’s taken hold among the very, very online American right wing and their favorite politicians on the ragged edge of the Republican Party. The literary canon of that movement is published in part by Imperium Press.  Yockey’s “Imperium” has even inspired its own modern-fascist political party in Europe, Imperium Europa. It’s active in European parliamentary elections even right now.  Senator Herman Welker of Idaho was one of two Republicans who helped McCarthy in his blackmail campaign against Lester Hunt. Herman Welker was so devoted to McCarthy that his nickname was “Little Joe From Idaho.” After McCarthy died in May of 1957, Herman Welker also died before the end of that year. He was only 50 years old.  The other senator involved in the blackmail plot was Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire. When he died in 1961, he had somehow accumulated millions of dollars in cash, which he had stuffed into suitcases that he stashed with friends and staffers, under instructions that they should deliver the luggage unopened to his widow upon his death.  When it came time to bury Senator Bridges, his widow reportedly asked LBJ what she should do with all that cash. A big chunk of Interstate 93 in New Hampshire is still named after Republican Senator Styles Bridges today.  The retired admiral who headed up the petition effort against McCarthy’s censure, who had ordered the armored truck guards to draw their pistols at the doors of the Senate, he ran for office himself multiple times in his home state of Alabama. He ran as a segregationist and an antisemite.  In his 1956 race for U.S. Senate, he made multiple campaign appearances with a Klan leader who had orchestrated the beating of Nat King Cole on stage in the middle of a performance, at the Birmingham Municipal Auditorium. By 1964, the FBI would be investigating Admiral Crommelin’s alleged role in a plan with other former senior military officers to forcibly overthrow the U.S. government. He was never charged.  John Crommelin and his brothers today have a U.S. Navy frigate named after them. Crommelin was named to the Alabama Military Hall of Fame in 2003, amid some complaints.  Gerald L.K. Smith lived until 1976. He remained a Holocaust denier his whole life. He is remembered most today for a 60-foot-tall statue called “Christ of the Ozarks” which he erected in Arkansas in 1966. He’s buried beneath it. Its detractors call it “Our Milk Carton With Arms.”  Senator Lester Hunt’s son Buddy married. He had kids. He was a well-regarded community organizer and then a college professor. When he was 87 years old, he wrote to the U.S. Justice Department asking for a formal review of the circumstances of his father’s death. After all, blackmail is a crime. As far as we have been able to tell, Buddy never received a response before he died.  The U.S. Justice Department appears to have never investigated the blackmail campaign against U.S. Senator Lester Hunt, nor did the United States Senate.  In 2023, a Republican state legislator in Wyoming whose family had been friends and neighbors with Senator Hunt decided to ask the state legislature in Wyoming to pass a simple resolution commemorating the service of Lester Hunt, who had served as secretary of state and as a two-term governor, and as U.S. senator.  His fellow Republicans in the legislature voted it down.  Nazi defense lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer didn’t die until the 1980s. He was active in Holocaust denial and neo-Nazi causes his whole life. His last publication, in 1983, was a fake autobiography of the Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann, who’d fled Germany and hidden in Argentina after World War II.  Aschenauer claimed that he found memoirs from Eichmann that proved that the Nazis had never really wanted to kill any Jews at all, that it was all just a big misunderstanding.  Thanks to the efforts of Aschenauer and the antisemitic Atlanta lawyer Willis Everett and, of course, Republican U.S. Senator Joe McCarthy no one ever served considerable time, let alone faced execution, for Malmedy, for the worst massacre of unarmed American POWs in World War II.  First, the dozens of death sentences were all commuted, and then all of the Nazis were let go. The last one to be released was the Blowtorch Battalion’s commanding officer, Joachim Peiper, who eventually moved to France. In 1976, he was murdered in an arson attack. An underground, anonymous group of Holocaust survivors claimed credit for killing him.  On the wall of Joe McCarthy’s apartment in Washington, McCarthy hung a sledgehammer mounted in a frame. On it were painted the words, “For Drew Pearson Only.”  When crusading columnist Drew Pearson died in the fall of 1969, he was the most widely syndicated columnist in the United States. His funeral was held at Washington National Cathedral.  Pearson: McCarthy abused American army officers because they convicted the Nazis who shot 150 American soldiers in cold blood at Malmedy. What McCarthy did not like from a newspaperman then and what he doesn’t like from his fellow senators now is anyone who opposes him or exposes him. I predict that Senator McCarthy will have no more luck bulldozing his fellow senators than he had in silencing me and that, despite his usual divisive tactics, they will pull together to keep this nation strong and make democracy live. Maddow: We have these moments in American history. These recurrent, delicate moments where our democracy feels mortal, fragile.  But the Americans who fought these fights before us left us their stories, of courage, to show us how.  “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra” is a production of MSNBC.

It was a failed test and a little bit of a scandal. But it wasn’t a doomsday weapon of the kind described on the radio that day by physicist Leo Szilard. That kind of a bomb has never been built.  Wyoming State Senator: This is Senate Joint Resolution 2, recognizing the service of Lester C. Hunt to be presented to us by Senator Case. State Sen. Cale Case (R-WY): Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I’m very grateful to be here. I would just like to read a little of this newspaper to you to start off: “Cheyenne was a quiet, respectful city last night, as the body of Senator Lester C. Hunt was brought home for funeral services. A silent crowd of hundreds watched the Air Force DC-6 carrying one of the state’s best loved statesmen landed.  “Army National Guard units representing every corner of the State snapped to attention and rendered a final salute to the man who gave more than 20 years of his life to public office. A plane carrying 17 Congressional leaders and personal representatives of President Dwight Eisenhower preceded the plane carrying Hunt’s body and members of his family.  “Cars choked the access streets. And at every home -- cars choked the access streets. And, at every home, people lined the curb paying a silent tribute to the senator. There were tears in the eyes of many. Old men stood at attention. Children were silent. The group numbered into the thousands, police said.” My father was there that day. He was one of the honorary pallbearers. I don’t think that this story’s ever gotten the respect from Wyoming that -- that, really, it’s called for.  Anyway, that’s the darn story. And it’s a -- it’s a big story. And so, I thought it’d be good if we did a resolution to recognize this."

Kamala Harris has MAGA world freaking out about demons and the apocalypse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 4, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-maga-jezebel-apocalypse-rcna164922,"It’s always the end of the world for the Make America Great Again movement. Ever since Donald Trump’s escalator ride in 2015, there’s been zero nuance to the MAGA message. “Only I can fix it,” the leader roared to thunderous applause upon accepting the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. But especially since Vice President Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic nominee, MAGA messaging has gone from overwrought and hyperbolic to absolutely hysterical and apocalyptic. Trumpists wave off any and all criticism as unworthy of discussion, bad-faith accusations from minds afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. And yet, deranged is the only appropriate descriptor of the rhetoric emanating from MAGA land’s loudest megaphones. It’s Trump and some of his closest allies and most prominent boosters who have been speaking of an imminent totalitarian government, end times and literal biblical demons. These people include podcasters with massive, fiercely dedicated audiences. Titans of industry. Religious extremists with political ambitions and close ties to Trump world. And the richest man in the world. In just the past week, popular MAGA pundits warned that Harris is “Hitler and Stalin combined but times 200,” and also a “commie” who will choose a running mate who supports “allowing men to beat up women in the Olympics.” They also expressed outrage over the opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics as the end of “Western civilization,” and singled out one woman on a Zoom fundraiser call for Harris’ campaign as another harbinger of end times. Then there was the billionaire Trump supporter who finally freed himself from the burden of pretending he’s not MAGA, Elon Musk, bringing back one of his favorite apocalyptic buzzwords, “extinctionist,” to describe Harris. (And because he’s a serious adult, he called her “Shamala.”) Musk once generally reserved that term for environmentalists — or really anyone concerned about climate change. But he’s since expanded the definition to anything that involves the mysterious and horror-movie-sounding “woke mind virus.” In 2023, Musk told Joe Rogan, “It’s essentially the extinctionists. It is that they’re propagating the extinction of humanity and civilization.” It’s hard to argue what’s “most disturbing” among these deranged comments from very angry people, but a worthy contender came from Lance Wallnau, the influential Christian nationalist who has the ears of both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. He likened the first Black and Indian woman to be nominated for president by a major party to Jezebel — a spirit with demonic powers. In case he wasn’t driving the point home with just the name, Wallnau clarified that Harris represents “the spirit of Jezebel … in a way that’ll be even much more ominous than Hillary because she’ll bring a racial component and she’s younger.” The MAGA right hasn’t cornered the market on ridiculous and irresponsible hyperbole in politics. Left, right and center are all capable of taking liberties with facts, hyping the fear factor and exaggerating the stakes. But of all American political tribes, there’s only one with politically influential figures using this election season to prophesize about Jezebels and explicitly making it about race and gender. Or literally warning of the imminent end of the world because of a Marxist conspiracy to smuggle totalitarianism on an unsuspecting public through environmentalism. This was once the content you’d find on the furthest, most ridiculous fringes of the AM radio dial. And they are what remains of the brain trust of the MAGA movement. The first Trump presidency — right up to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and ultimate incitement of a riot at the Capitol — was consistent in the fact that the only people who stayed until the end were the true believers. Anyone with a modicum of independence was jettisoned, forever. The aforementioned MAGA influencers are worthy of ridicule, sure, but they’re more worthy of thoughtful, diligent scrutiny, because they’d be guiding forces of what might pass for principles in a second Trump administration."
Kamala Harris shouldn’t ignore immigration. She should run on it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 4, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-defend-immigration-become-president-rcna164423,"As Democrats have coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, Republicans have, in turn, coalesced around their main issue to attack: immigration. President Joe Biden had struggled to respond to immigration criticism. Harris can do better, and she should start by doing the one thing that Biden failed to do: defending immigrants.  Biden’s strategy was simply to ignore immigration. When pressed, he’d say, “They should all be going back.” During his debate with former President Donald Trump, he touted his recent “total ban” on asylum. It’s no surprise that with both parties’ nominees arguing in favor of restriction, more voters are shifting to the Trump position.  But elevating the Trump position hurt Biden and will hurt Harris. If voters want Trump policies, they will elect Trump. At this point, it’s worse than wasted breath to talk about how Biden’s team tried to deport as many people as it could. Defending immigrants would be the most unexpected way to turn the tide in her favor.  The only speech Trump knows how to give is: “Immigrants are coming over the border to kill you.” But the facts about crime are devastating to Trump: When he was president, homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, and as immigrants have come in under the Biden administration, the violent crime and homicide rates have fallen by historic amounts.  Do immigrants deserve any credit? Probably! Immigrants commit fewer serious crimes that put them in prison, including fewer criminal homicides, than U.S.-born Americans. At the same time, by buying vacant homes and starting businesses at higher rates, they revitalize distressed neighborhoods hollowed out by pandemic-induced population loss. This indirectly lowers the crime rate.  Harris should ask Trump directly: So why do you want less safe, shrinking communities with higher crime rates?  Trump would no doubt also say, as he did during his convention speech, that the Biden immigration surge has brought “poverty” and “destruction to communities all across our land.” Harris should be ready.  Destruction? The Congressional Budget Office finds that the surge will boost the economy by $7 trillion and reduce the federal debt by nearly $1 trillion by 2034.  With America’s aging population, the country is millions of workers short of what Social Security needs for revenues to meet expenses by 2034, and the Social Security trustees say immigration will help close the gap. The Federal Reserve chair believes that new immigrants most likely helped stave off a recession by increasing economic growth.  Again, Harris should ask Trump: Why do you want a smaller economy with more debt? Why do you want to undermine Social Security? Do you want a recession? Trump hates to talk about immigration as an economic phenomenon partly because, as a business owner who has hired undocumented workers, he knows that it is beneficial. Instead, he would deflect to something else, like fentanyl trafficking.  Once again, Harris has the facts: U.S. citizens are 89% of fentanyl traffickers, and when did fentanyl overdoses spike? In 2020, under Trump, when the border was supposedly closed. According to recent academic research, immigration is associated with fewer overdose deaths. This is most likely because immigrants are much less likely to be consumers of dangerous drugs, so they overdose much less than other people. Trump’s efforts to demonize immigrants work when his opponents don’t bother countering his attacks. Harris doesn’t have to lead with immigration. But she can’t simply let Trump spew lies about immigrants for hours and expect it not to hurt her chances.  This confrontational approach may seem too risky politically, but it’s worth remembering that Joe Biden campaigned in 2020 against Trump’s harsh policies, and he won. In the general election debate, he criticized Trump for deporting asylum-seekers to “squalor.” His reversal hasn’t helped him. It has only validated Trump’s criticisms. Democrats’ instincts are right in one respect: Americans really don’t like chaos. Harris shouldn’t defend lawlessness. Instead, she should tout how the administration is quietly rebuilding the legal immigration system devastated by four years of President Trump and creating new legal ways for people to come, reducing illegal immigration.  Much more work must be done to fix the system, but Harris can credibly say she wants people to come lawfully. How exactly does Trump think people should come? Well, Trump’s record shows that he only slashed legal immigration. He didn’t reduce illegal immigration. That’s the only answer that matters. Harris needs to see that Biden’s defensiveness about immigration failed badly. She must start from a position of strength. Immigrants — legal and illegal — are helping America solve its biggest challenges. Force Trump to explain why that’s bad. He can’t, but so far, he has never had to.

Alfred crossed the finish line in 10.72 seconds to win Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal. Richardson came in behind her at 10.87 seconds and Jefferson at 10.92 seconds. It is both Richardson’s and Jefferson’s first-ever Olympic medal as well. Although the U.S. had high hopes for a gold from Richardson, who was the reigning 100-meter world champion coming into the race, her second-place win Saturday was nevertheless a triumphant Olympic comeback. Three years ago, the 24-year-old was suspended from the sport for a month after testing positive for THC, which prevented her from participating in the Tokyo Olympics (THC is not a performance-enhancing drug, but it is a prohibited substance in the Games). Richardson won her opening-round heat on Friday. She came in second in the 100-meter semifinal earlier on Saturday, also behind Alfred."
"Jimmy Carter, 99, is holding out to vote for Kamala Harris, his grandson says",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 1:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jimmy-carter-vote-kamala-harris-rcna165019,"Former President Jimmy Carter, who is in hospice care and is less than two months away from his 100th birthday, is holding out to vote for Kamala Harris for president, his grandson Jason Carter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His son Chip Carter had asked if he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday, according to Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator. The nonagenarian then told his son, “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” his grandson said. Carter entered hospice care at his Georgia home in February 2023. He is the oldest living and longest-lived former president in U.S. history. He will turn 100 years old on Oct. 1, and early voting in Georgia begins on Oct. 15. Carter has had less frosty relations with Donald Trump relative to his fellow former Democratic presidents. He has criticized some of Trump’s behaviors while also defending him from the media in the past. However, in 2019, he suggested that the Republican was an illegitimate president, saying, “Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.” Meanwhile, Trump has made references to the 99-year-old in his attacks on President Joe Biden. During a campaign speech in January, Trump brought up former first lady Rosalynn Carter’s funeral (which his wife attended but he did not) saying, “It was beautiful. Jimmy Carter was there. I thought to myself, ‘Jimmy Carter is happy now, because he will go down as a brilliant president by comparison to Joe Biden.’”"
Elizabeth Taylor turned a scandal into a playbook for modern fame,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hbos-elizabeth-taylor-doc-chronicles-birth-modern-celebrity-rcna164997,"Two years after igniting a global scandal of such seismic proportions it was said to have knocked NASA’s first orbit of the Earth off the front pages, 32-year-old Elizabeth Taylor sat down with Life magazine’s Richard Meryman to tell her side of the story. The 40 hours of audio recordings from these interviews constitute the bulk of HBO Max’s new documentary “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes,” which brings the late actress’s story to life in her own words. The documentary humanizes the two-time Oscar winner, exhibiting her personality, humor and the obstacles she faced both personally and professionally as she scaled the behemoth of midcentury Hollywood misogyny. In doing so, the film paints a three-dimensional picture of the complex woman behind the eight marriages, bewitching eyes and incessant gossip headlines that later dominated the Elizabeth Taylor mystique. For many years, this half-mythical caricature of Taylor distracted from the transformative impact she had on society and culture. Only recently, for example, has she been given credit — including by the likes of Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian — for inventing the prototype of the modern celebrity. In the podcast series “Elizabeth the First,” Perry labels Taylor the “first true influencer” for pioneering the concept of a public figure as their own brand long before it was fashionable. Taylor debuts this shrewd understanding of her “public” versus “private” self throughout the tapes, creating distance from what she calls “Elizabeth Taylor, the commodity.” Refusing to apologize or justify herself, she instead muses over her so-called “immoral” reputation with stone-cold detachment. “There is a private Elizabeth,” she tells Meryman. “The other Elizabeth, the famous one, really has no depth or meaning to me. It is a commodity that makes money.” Her cynicism is understandable. As the tapes reveal, Taylor’s public image was artificially imposed on her for years by the Hollywood studio system, which manufactured her into a “sex symbol” as young as 16, while also confining her to low-paying, often low-quality pictures. “I was forced to do things that I hated,” she tells Meryman. “I was given such s---- that you should choke on.” But over time, “a kind of rebellion started within me,” Taylor recalls. After her seven-year contract ended, the then-30-year-old was free to choose her own films and set her price tag. “I was quite the businesswoman,” she laughs, recounting how she became the first actress to negotiate a $1 million salary ($10 million today) for what she called the “ridiculous” idea of casting her as Cleopatra. Taylor shows a sense of humor, and at times outright contempt, for the production, which overthrew two dynasties of Fox leadership, gutted directors’ careers, ended two marriages, nearly bankrupted Twentieth Century Fox (at a staggering $450 million in today’s dollars), launched an FBI investigation and even damaged U.S. foreign relations abroad, according to damning remarks immortalized in the U.S. Congressional Record. At the same time, the tumultuous production marked a transformative moment in Taylor’s career, when she began to use her fame and notoriety as a weapon against the patriarchal culture that had long dictated and profited off her image. After years of genuflecting before patronizing executives, producers and directors — whom she bitterly recalls dismissing her as a “movie star, not an actress” — the then-four-times-married mother of three discovered she could beat them at their own game. By leaving what she reveals to be an unhappy and at times abusive marriage to Eddie Fisher and having a very public affair — and worse still, refusing to apologize for it — Taylor took a gamble with the public that paid off. Whether by accident or design, Taylor’s “breaking of conventions,” as she described her and Richard Burton’s affair, coincided with a slow-rolling spirit of rebellion taking place across America in the 1960s. She not only rose from the ashes of moral indignation unscathed, but also saw her notoriety skyrocket to levels never seen before, and possibly since. During and after the film, Taylor’s private life garnered such ferocious public interest that an entire industry — the paparazzi — stepped in to satisfy the demand. While Taylor resents their intrusive presence in the tapes, they also, inadvertently, helped further liberate her from the overbearing grip of the studio, inviting the public in to make their own decisions about her. By tearing down the barrier between the star and the public, Taylor’s act of “rebellion” not only weakened one of the few levers of power the studio regime still wielded, but also allowed her to engineer a new playbook for modern stardom entirely from scratch. In it, she portrayed a version of herself to the public that didn’t conceal her flaws, but embraced them. It could be argued that there are two Hollywoods: one before Elizabeth Taylor and one after. Today, fans want and expect truth, vulnerability and controversy from celebrities. Scandals are no longer liabilities, but assets. From Taylor Swift to Kim Kardashian, there is no such thing as either a “perfect” star or a “private” one. In giving celebrities the power to be themselves, Taylor’s model transformed the public into consumers of their public lives, rather than just observers, in a way that forever altered what it means to be famous. While it’s arguable whether this new model has been good or bad, the documentary is a fascinating reminder of where the debate over the private lives of public figures first began. Taylor’s greatest legacy was bringing honesty and candor to stardom in a way that forever transformed the relationship between celebrities and the public — and freed Hollywood stars to be, for better or worse, themselves. By using her fame to push boundaries, Taylor chipped away at the oppressive outerwear of an antiquated, patriarchal system, exposing its vulnerabilities and at the same time bringing contentious issues to the forefront of public awareness throughout her career. By giving new context to a woman who was, in many ways, too modern for her time, the film cements Taylor’s legacy not as a sex symbol, but as the trailblazing actress, feminist, philanthropist, entrepreneur and activist who played a central role in shaping the world of fame as we know it today."
"Judge tees up dismissal of Giuliani bankruptcy, opening door for creditors to collect",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 12:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-freeman-moss-rcna165001,"A judge approved a deal to dismiss Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy on Friday, which will bring an end to a case that has for months frustrated his creditors and, at times, even the judge. The dismissal of Giuliani’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy will mean his creditors can soon begin to go after his assets to recover some of the money they’re owed. That includes Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, two Georgia election workers whom Giuliani defamed over the 2020 election and to whom he owes nearly $150 million in a civil judgment. A former lawyer for Donald Trump, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December 2023 after being handed the verdict in Freeman and Moss’ defamation case. His seeking bankruptcy protections meant that the Georgia women could not begin to collect on the judgment, and it froze proceedings in the other civil lawsuits against him (he has denied any wrongdoing in those cases). But the disgraced lawyer’s bankruptcy bogged down in what his creditors characterized as his stonewalling and lack of cooperation. Giuliani’s lawyers eventually requested that his bankruptcy be converted to Chapter 7 so that his assets could be liquidated, then later proposed the case be dismissed entirely. New York Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane agreed in mid-July to dismiss Giuliani’s bankruptcy, but afterward threatened to reverse that decision because of Giuliani’s failure to pay roughly $400,000 in administrative expenses — which Giuliani claimed he did not have the ability to pay. On Wednesday, Giuliani came to an agreement with his creditors to pay $100,000 of that sum now, and then settle the remainder of those expenses when he sells his penthouse apartment in New York or his Florida condo. The $100,000 is due one business day after the Friday ruling, after which his bankruptcy case will officially be dismissed, NBC News reported. Giuliani’s spokesperson, Ted Goodman, did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Attorneys for Freeman and Moss also did not respond."
The U.S.-Puerto Rico basketball clash is more than a game,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 3, 2024, 10:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-puerto-rico-basketball-statehood-rcna164491,"UPDATE (August 3, 2024, 1:20 p.m. ET): On Saturday, the U.S. men's basketball team held off Puerto Rico, winning 104-83. For the first time since 2004, the Puerto Rico men’s basketball team is playing in the Olympics. It hasn’t been a smooth ride: The team lost its first two games against South Sudan and Serbia. But on Saturday, the team has a chance to repeat what it did 20 years ago to the day: upset a United States team stacked with NBA superstars. That historic 92-73 win in Athens, powered by a career game from guard Carlos Arroyo, is forever etched in Puerto Rico’s national history and cultural identity. On paper, a Paris repeat may seem impossible. This year’s U.S. team has more former NBA MVPs than any team in the Games’ history. The Americans are playing like defending Olympic champions and the U.S. is otherwise undefeated against Puerto Rico in all-time Olympic competition. “It’s never impossible,” Arroyo, now the team’s general manager, told CBS News last month about a repeat upset. “It’s just never impossible.” If the impossible indeed becomes possible on Saturday, it will remind the world that even though Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, sports sovereignty and pride might be the reasons why the U.S. colony might never become a state. “The basketball is the weapon,” Flor Meléndez, the legendary assistant coach of that 2004 team, told me in Spanish for a podcast episode I reported in 2021. “We Puerto Ricans don’t have an army, but for us, that was the weapon we used to represent our country. The basketball jersey was our uniform. That is how I felt.” Not an Olympics goes by without people asking why Puerto Rico has Olympic teams and athletes in the first place. The history is a complicated one, and every time a Puerto Rican experiences Olympic success, debates about identity and who gets to call themselves Puerto Rican follow. It is the constant tug and pull that affects an estimated 3.2 million Puerto Ricans living on the island and another 5.8 million who reside in the 50 states. That complexity extends Puerto Rico’s strong men’s basketball tradition, which wouldn’t have reached a golden age were it not for Puerto Ricans born and raised in cities like New York. These conflicting impulses are particularly difficult to reconcile for the island’s most ardent supporters of statehood. Current Gov. Pedro Pierluisi and other statehood advocates hail Puerto Rico’s Olympic team even as they advocate for a political status that would essentially end the island’s proud sports sovereignty. Statehood supporters argue the island can have both. It’s true that official Olympic representation is governed by the International Olympic Committee, which has considered Puerto Rico an official member since 1948. Edwin Jusino, a Puerto Rican historian who focuses on sports and supports statehood for Puerto Rico, pointed out that governments are not the arbiters of national teams. That falls on national olympic committees (NOCs) and their sporting federations. “These NOCs are supposed to be autonomous from each country and operate without direct government interference,” Jusino said, noting that the world’s top surfer, John John Florence, surfs for Hawaii in a professional league. But Florence just competed in the 2024 Paris Games for — you guessed it — Team USA. If Puerto Rico were to become a state, there’s no reason to expect there would still be a Team Puerto Rico. In addition, in the specific case of international basketball, FIBA’s own 2021 statutes say that a national federation applying for membership must be “the controlling body of basketball in a country that is an independent state, recognized by the international community.” Puerto Rico became a FIBA member in 1957, but if it were to apply today, it wouldn’t be part of FIBA, and it would not be a member if statehood ever became a reality. (When I asked the IOC if it would still recognize Puerto Rico if it became a state, a spokesperson replied via email, “We cannot comment on speculations.”) Still, that won’t stop statehood supporters from trying to twist the logic, as if the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) would oblige. There is also the issue of American culture itself. At this moment in American politics, the rallying cry of “united we stand” has taken on xenophobic tones. It’s hard to believe that the United States, which has literally owned Puerto Rico since 1898, would be so magnanimous as to let Puerto Rico become a state and then keep sports sovereignty. The current Republican platform doesn’t even address Puerto Rico’s political status after years of supporting statehood. Democrats are still being criticized by Puerto Rico diaspora groups for not fully embracing the status question. In the end, once again Puerto Rico is being ignored and misunderstood. Another nonbinding status plebiscite is scheduled for November, and statehood advocates should at least be honest with their fellow Puerto Ricans that statehood will be the end of sports sovereignty and national pride. But Saturday in Paris, Puerto Ricans can briefly put those questions on hold. As I said at the end of my 2021 report about that upset in Athens 20 years ago: The impossible has happened before. Why not again?"
Harris campaign says Trump is ‘running scared’ after he floats Fox News debate with new rules,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 9:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-debate-kamala-harris-audience-fox-news-rcna164990,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is insisting that Donald Trump honor his commitment to the ABC News debate on Sept. 10, rather than schedule an entirely different debate with new terms and a new date. “Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” the Harris campaign said in a statement on Saturday. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept. 10.” After refusing for several weeks to commit to debating Harris, the former president wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday that he had “agreed” to a Fox News debate against her on Sept. 4 with a “FULL ARENA AUDIENCE,” reneging on previously agreed-upon debate rules that he had set with President Joe Biden’s campaign. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment sent by NBC News early Saturday. Not having a live audience at the debate had been one of the Biden campaign’s key demands, especially against an opponent who is more prone to lying and delivering sound bites than to engaging in substantive policy discussion. Trump has waffled on his participation in the Sept. 10 debate since Biden dropped out of the race. Harris has repeatedly challenged Trump to meet her on the debate stage, and Democrats have taunted the former president as being “afraid” to go up against Harris, a former prosecutor. In his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the ABC News debate had been “terminated” because Biden had stepped aside, and he cited his ongoing litigation against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos as a “conflict of interest” (while using a disparaging distortion of Stephanopoulos’ name). Trump’s defamation lawsuit against Stephanopoulos and ABC News had already been underway when his campaign agreed to the Sept. 10 debate with the network. The Harris campaign said Saturday that it would be “happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to.” The de facto Democratic nominee will still appear at the ABC News event whether or not Trump participates, her campaign said."
There's a simple reason Simone Biles seems unbeatable at the Paris Olympics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 3, 2024, 8:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/simone-biles-paris-olympics-gymnastics-vault-difficulty-score-rcna164948,"UPDATE (August 3, 2024, 11:20 a.m. ET): On Saturday, Simone Biles won gold in the women's vault, bringing her total of Paris Olympic gold medals to three, with two more events to go. The allure of gymnastics has always been in the jaw-dropping leaps and flips and twists. The sport has evolved considerably over the decades, with those flips and twists becoming even more difficult — and more impressive. We are living through a truly historic era of innovation. And no surprise: Simone Biles, the GOAT, the most decorated Olympic gymnast, and perhaps athlete, of all time, is at the helm. On Saturday, after leading Team USA to a gold medal in the women’s team final and earning a second gold in the individual all-around competition, Biles looks to add to her Paris haul on the vault. On Thursday, Biles helped secure her all-around gold with a Yurchenko double pike, which has become known as the Biles II. She is the only woman who has ever completed that skill in a world competition. It truly feels magical to watch her complete the Biles II with such power and grace. And therein lies one of the secrets to Biles’ immense success. Because besides the numerous titles and sustained dominance in the sport for over a decade, Biles is set apart by the degree to which she surpasses the competition. She does not win by tenths or even a single point but by multiple points. At the U.S. Olympic trials, she won by over 5 points, the rough equivalent of nearly six falls. Theoretically, this means Biles could have fallen half a dozen times and still beat the 2020 Olympic champion, Sunisa Lee. Biles is truly in a league of her own. But how is this possible? The answer is simple. Biles performs some of the hardest skills in the world and continues to complete increasingly harder ones, including some that no one else can do. Biles’ difficulty puts on her on a completely differently level; a new starting point means a new end point. And, under the current scoring system, she’s rewarded for it. A major 2006 change to the gymnastics scoring system has allowed for and encouraged athletes to push for difficulty. Under the current code of points, the execution score (E-score) of 10.0 remains in place, but the difficulty score (D-score) has no cap. What this means is gymnasts no longer have equal scoring potential. It’s like making the 3-point shot into a 4-point shot if it’s made from the top of the key; Caitlin Clark would have a higher scoring potential than her competitors because she can execute a more difficult shot. But here again, Biles highlights what makes her so incredibly special. The 27-year-old is not simply doing the hardest tricks, she does them with exquisite execution, which allows her to be incredibly consistent. Her technique, power and precision are together essential to her ability to do what no one else can do, but it also means that her timing is nearly perfect, and her execution scores are consistently strong. When you add that together — the unmatched levels of difficulty, striking execution and rock-solid consistency — you have a gymnast who is for all intents and purposes unbeatable. And that’s what we have in Simone Biles. Don’t get me wrong — there are event specialists who can top Biles on a single apparatus. For example, Kaylia Nemour, who is competing for Algeria, boasts a 7-point start value on the uneven bars (compared to Biles’ 6.4) and Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade is perhaps the closest rival to Biles on the vault and floor events. In fact, during the all-around final this week, Biles made a crucial error on the uneven bars that opened the door (however lightly) for Andrade. In the end, Biles’ stellar beam and floor routines landed her on top, with Andrade taking silver. But it was a reminder that even GOATs are human. Now, we will get to see more of that head-to-head competition in the individual event finals over the next few days, starting with vault on Saturday and ending with the balance beam and floor exercise on Monday. The world’s very best event specialists will be pushing the limits for the chance to bring home gold. But don’t count Biles out — ever. No matter the event, she exudes the qualities that make viewers fall in love with this sport — the irresistible joy and awe of watching a gymnast do high-flying, jaw-dropping tricks with beauty and ease.What a gift to be able to sit back and enjoy the greatness."
The real reason Team Trump keeps trying to call Kamala Harris a ‘DEI hire’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/team-trump-calls-kamala-harris-dei-hire-rcna164117,"Despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ education, her years as a prosecutor, her having served as California attorney general and a U.S. senator, Republicans such as Reps. Harriet Hageman, of Wyoming, and Tim Burchett, of Tennessee, are among many who have referred to her as a “DEI hire.” Hageman said: “I think she’s one of the weakest candidates I’ve ever seen in the history of our country. I mean intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel. ... I think that she was a DEI hire.” Burchett referred to her as “our DEI vice president.” They could have attacked Harris’ record without referring to DEI, but instead they chose to say “DEI hire” and “DEI vice president” to perpetuate a narrative that people of color and women can only be in positions of power or authority because of quotas, preferential treatment and unfair advantage given to them based on their social identities. That is: not because of their education, qualifications, training or experience. These false racist and sexist attacks seek to reinforce beliefs that the best, and potentially only, people qualified to lead America are white men. Attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion are attempts to maintain the status quo.    Attacking the credibility of people of color, women, people with disabilities and others from historically marginalized groups is nothing new in America. The only thing new is the collective misrepresentation of the term diversity, equity, and inclusion to do it. The acronym DEI has been weaponized by people who feel threatened by the racial diversification of America and its leadership; the success of women in corporate and public sector jobs; the mere presence of people with disabilities in the workplace and in society; as well as the increased visibility of LGBTQ+ people and their families. They perceive that reality as an existential crisis. In addition to elected officials, there have been numerous recent examples of highly visible powerbrokers and pundits denigrating people of color, specifically Black people, claiming they are unqualified for the positions they hold, and that they were hired based on their race, not merit. In January, not long after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in flight, Elon Musk took to his social media platform X to criticize efforts by United Airlines and Boeing to diversify their pilots and factory workers. “It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE,” he wrote, misspelling the acronym.  He was responding to an X user who speculated about the IQs of pilots who attended historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. The next day, Musk said, “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening.” His lie that the airline’s DEI policies had endangered the public was shared with millions of X users. Again, this is not new. First, powerful opponents of progress sought to discredit and gut affirmative action policies. Now they have their sights set on anything they choose to label DEI. This strategy to characterize Black people as unqualified, framed within the context of “DEI hires,” is a targeted effort to attack policies and practices that have created pathways to leadership and power for people of color, women, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, and others. Because while “DEI hire” has been most frequently used to discredit women and people of color, it is also used to devalue the contributions of people with disabilities and other marginalized and oppressed identities. The weaponization of the term DEI cuts across sectors and disciplines, including in health care and medicine, where I have had health care executives tell me that DEI efforts in hospitals or medical schools lower standards and thereby jeopardize the quality of care provided to patients. One health care executive went so far as to say that “a diverse hire,” another way to say DEI hire, would underperform because they trained at an HBCU. Although factually inaccurate, these beliefs about DEI have taken hold in our national narrative.  So, what is DEI really? Diversity, equity and inclusion supports full participation of all people; promotes fair treatment through the intentional use of power, policies and practices; and values individuals within the context of their identities, not in spite of them. It is a response to glaring inequities throughout society, particularly those in education and employment. Recent reversals of public and institutional policies that advance DEI are most often the result of orchestrated resistance by people who believe that DEI will disenfranchise and disempower white people, especially white men. Frankly, the data does not support those claims. After decades of policies and practices to support DEI, inequities in opportunities and pay continue to plague women and people of color. A 2021 study by Judd Kessler and Corinne Low found that “firms hiring in STEM fields rated minority and female candidates significantly lower than white males. Among STEM majors, to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75 GPA, a minority or female candidate needed a 4.0.” Even with DEI policies in place, Black women make 66 cents on the dollar compared with their white male counterparts, when doing the same jobs with comparable qualifications. These statistics and examples indicate the necessity of DEI. They also point to how dangerous the misappropriation and weaponization of DEI is to decades of slow and fragile social progress and policy change.  The truth about DEI is that it promotes American values that are necessary for a healthy, functional and thriving democracy. It is consistent with ideals such as liberty and justice for all people. That is not a zero-sum game where one group’s gain is another’s loss. Instead, it is America making good on its promise to create a society where everyone can flourish and contribute their talents and skills to the collective good while having a fair chance to succeed. These ideals are woven into the complex fabric of who we are as a nation, and we cannot afford to regress to darker times.

Why Project 2025 is still a threat,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/project-2025-still-threat-rcna164949,"After the director of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 stepped down on Tuesday, the Trump campaign once again attempted to distance itself, writing it “welcomed” reports of the project’s “demise.” This statement is nothing new. On our show, we’ve extensively covered the absurdity of former President Donald Trump’s selective amnesia around Project 2025. In short, Trump has claimed numerous times to “know nothing” about Project 2025, even though the plan was developed by his former and (likely) future staff. Furthermore, in newly surfaced audio, Heritage President Kevin Roberts is heard acknowledging that Trump’s claims of ignorance about Project 2025 are a “political tactical decision.” If you need any more proof that Trump’s denial is misleading, on Thursday it was reported that Sen. JD Vance wrote the foreword to Roberts’ new book, in which Vance called Roberts’ ideas “an essential weapon.” Roberts has confirmed that Project 2025 “completed exactly what it set out to do” and will continue its efforts to “build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels — federal, state, and local.” As New York Times reporter Jonathan Swan noted, Project 2025 already finished its comprehensive list of policy recommendations. The work is already done. On Thursday, President Joe Biden announced the successful negotiation of a prisoner exchange leading to the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran Paul Whelan, and journalists Vladimir Kara-Murza and Alsu Kurmasheva, marking a major diplomatic achievement. This swap is one of the largest and most complex prisoner exchanges in U.S. history, involving seven countries and the release of 24 individuals from around the world. And it is a major victory for Biden’s administration. There are not many joyful days in diplomacy, but the impact of the successful exchange, likely months in the making, was evident as national security adviser Jake Sullivan became visibly emotional while discussing the return of these hostages. It’s also important to remember that this is just the beginning for those who have been released. As Jason and Yeganeh Rezaian discussed on our show in July marking the 10th anniversary of their wrongful imprisonment in Iran, a safe release marks the start of a long journey of recovery. In the spirit of the Olympic Games, our spotlight this week is on Monica Tranel, a former Olympian and current candidate for Montana’s 1st Congressional District. Tranel represented the United States in rowing at the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics. After her athletic career, she became an attorney and staunch advocate for clean energy and environmental protections. She has worked to defend the interests of small businesses and local ranchers and continues to prioritize the preservation of Montana’s public lands in her political campaigns. Tranel came within just 3 points of winning in 2022. In June, the Cook Political Report considered the seat “likely Republican,” but it remains an interesting race to watch. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shot onto many peoples’ radars in the last few weeks following his outspoken criticism of the Republican Party’s “weird” agenda.

Biden's historic prisoner exchange was a feat Trump could never have achieved,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 3:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-biden-prisoner-exchange-russia-rcna164944,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" On Thursday, basketball star Brittney Griner helped lead the U.S. women’s basketball team to victory against Belgium at the 2024 Paris Olympics.  The reason that victory was possible — the reason Griner was able to represent the U.S. in these Olympic games — was because of a feat of diplomacy by President Joe Biden. In February 2022, Griner was detained in Russia on trumped-up charges related to cannabis products found in her luggage. By August, she had been sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. But just a few months later, in December of that year, Biden announced that he had negotiated a historic prisoner swap — securing Griner’s safe release.  That’s why Brittney Griner was able to play for Team U.S.A. in the Paris Olympics. But Griner was not the only American prisoner being held in Russia, and the Biden White House sought to use the momentum from her release to continue negotiations for other hostages.  There was Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested on espionage charges in Russia back in 2018, charges that the U.S. and Whelan have both denied. And Vladimir Kara-Murza, an American green-card holder and longtime free press advocate in Russia. His arrest appeared to be an attempt by Vladimir Putin to silence one of his biggest critics.  Putin would go on to take even more prisoners. People like Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist working for The Wall Street Journal — who was also arrested on trumped-up espionage charges. And Alsu Kurmasheva, another American journalist who was arrested in August 2023 for failing to register as a foreign agent. All of them were being held as prisoners of the Russian government …until Thursday. On Thursday, in another historic series of negotiations, Biden secured the release of all four of those prisoners as part of a remarkably high-stakes, multilateral negotiation. In total, 24 people were released: 16 held captive by Russia and eight by the U.S. and our European allies. It was the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the Cold War. That on its own is extraordinary — but the details of how this deal came together are really something.  For years, families, friends, and employers of these American prisoners have been advocating for their release. In particular, the staff of The Wall Street Journal have been pushing relentlessly and publicly for the return of their colleague. The plight of Gershkovich even became an issue in the presidential election as former President Donald Trump boasted that Gershkovich would only be free once he was elected president: “Vladimir Putin, president of Russia will do that for me,"" said Trump, ""and I don’t believe he’ll do it for anyone else.” Trump thought he alone could secure Gershkovich’s release. But many people felt otherwise — including Gershkovich’s own mother. According to The Wall Street Journal, “In April of last year, she had rushed up to President Biden at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and grabbed his hands before imploring him: ‘You are the only one who can bring my boy home.’” She was right. Not only did Biden secure the release of Gershkovich and the other hostages, he did so using a careful and skillful strategy that Trump — and probably a lot of other politicians — simply could never pull off. For starters, Putin’s price for the release of these hostages, the key bargaining chip, was Vadim Krasikov. In 2019, Krasikov was arrested for assassinating a Chechen dissident in Berlin on behalf of Russia’s intelligence agency. Krasikov was a Kremlin-linked assassin serving a life sentence in Germany. He is someone so close to Putin that Western intelligence officials reportedly speculate may have even been the Russian president’s own personal bodyguard. To secure the release of these prisoners, Biden needed to get Germany to agree to release a very high-profile criminal back into Russian custody. That’s not something the German government was eager to do. But Biden made strengthening American bonds with NATO allies, like Germany, a cornerstone of his foreign policy — a stark reversal from the Trump-era policy of alienating Western democracies in favor of autocrats and dictators. And so, when the time came for Germany to play its part and release that Russian assassin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly told President Biden, “For you, I will do this.” President Biden first started working to secure support from our allies in the summer of 2023. By early 2024, it looked like a deal was coming together. But then, the whole thing nearly fell apart. One of the prisoners who the U.S. and Europe were hoping to get released as part of the deal was Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. But just a week after Biden secured Germany’s support, Navalny mysteriously died in a Russian prison, prompting global outrage. Biden then dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to help ensure the arrangement with Germany and other allies would hold. According to NBC News, at a February meeting between Harris and Scholz, the pair discussed the prisoner swap the U.S. was working toward. According to the official, Harris raised something Biden had recently discussed with the chancellor — that Germany’s release of Vadim Krasikov was a critical component of getting a prisoner swap with Russia.  A White House official said, “She moved the ball forward significantly in that meeting.” The official also said Harris’ meeting in Munich with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob was arranged specifically to try to help bring Slovenia on board with the multicountry prisoner swap. These meetings continued for months. Then, on July 17, the Biden administration got the news that the deal had finally come together.  That date is significant: It was the day Biden was diagnosed with Covid. Four days later, on Sunday, July 21, at 12:45 p.m., Biden was on the phone with the Prime Minister of Slovenia, hammering out the final details of the deal.  That date is also significant: just one hour later, Biden released a statement announcing his exit from the presidential race. Imagine, for a second, the kind of focus and fortitude it takes to be working on these kinds of high-stakes negotiations — at the same time that you’re making the most difficult decision of your political career ... and also recovering from Covid. Imagine, for a moment, what would have happened if it was Donald Trump in that situation. A man who has made a political career out of maligning America’s geopolitical alliances and who has been criminally charged for his efforts to stay in power.  Thursday’s act of delicate diplomacy was possible only because Joe Biden is the president.

"JD Vance, father of three biracial kids, defends Trump’s attack on Kamala Harris’ biracial identity",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 3:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-trump-harris-biracial-attack-totally-reasonable-rcna164893,"JD Vance, who has spoken of how his three biracial children have been targeted by racist attacks, is defending Donald Trump’s attack on Kamala Harris’ biracial identity as “totally reasonable.” The GOP vice presidential nominee told CNN on Thursday that Trump was merely portraying Harris as a “chameleon” when he falsely said Wednesday that the de facto Democratic presidential nominee “happened to turn Black” after initially identifying as Indian American. When asked whether Trump’s comments — which were roundly condemned as racist and even alarmed some Republicans — gave him pause, the Ohio senator said they did not. Vance added: This wasn’t the first time that Vance — who himself has had the authenticity of his Appalachian ties called into question — has used the line of attack on the vice president. At a campaign rally earlier this week, he said that Harris had used “a fake Southern accent” during an event in Atlanta and suggested that she was more Canadian than American. (Harris lived in Canada for about six years as a teenager.) The ease with which Vance endorsed Trump’s attack on Harris should put past comments of his own under scrutiny. While running for the Senate in 2022, Vance pushed back on his Democratic opponent’s charge that he was promoting the “great replacement” theory — even though he manifestly did — and pointed to his children, who are white and Indian, as proof that he had not engaged in racism. “What happens is that my own children, my biracial children, get attacked by scumbags online and in person because you are so desperate for political power that you’ll accuse me, the father of three beautiful biracial babies, of engaging in racism,” Vance said at the time. That Vance has decried racist attacks on his children and yet is now endorsing an attack on his political opponent’s biracial identity is worth noting. In his comments to CNN, Vance appeared to equate Harris’ leaning into her different racial identities at different times as part of a broader pattern of her flip-flopping on issues. But there’s a difference between changing one’s stance on a topic — as Vance himself has done — and the immutable fact of Harris’ biracial identity. Vance, as the father of biracial children himself, should know that."
July's weak jobs report sets up political dilemma for Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 2:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/july-jobs-report-economy-fed-trump-rcna164934,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 2 episode of ""Morning Joe."" It’s the first Friday of the month, which means the Bureau of Labor Statistics has released its jobs report. And there’s good news and bad news. First, the bad news. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July and employers added just 114,000 jobs. The number of jobs added is definitely lower than we expected. We’re also seeing wage growth slow (though it is still more than inflation). Both could be a problem for the economy. July’s weaker-than-expected report will only add to concerns that the Federal Reserve has waited too long to start cutting interest rates. However, let’s think about what the Fed needs to do here, because they have to balance two jobs: One, keep inflation under control. For nearly three years, all we’ve been talking about is inflation, inflation, inflation. It’s why the Fed hasn’t cut rates yet — with rates being higher, the goal is to try to slow the economy and cool inflation. Their other job is to focus on employment. To bring down inflation, they want to make sure the economy isn’t growing too fast, but they also need to make sure it’s not slowing down so much that employers stop expanding and hiring.  This is where Friday’s report could be good news. With numbers like what we saw, it’s now more likely the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates come September. It’s possible it might be even bigger than we’ve been expecting, though a lot can happen between now and then. It’s also tricky for the Fed. September is only two months before the election and a rate cut could thrust the Fed into the political spotlight.  Donald Trump and Project 2025 have been clear about where the Republican Party stands on this. They’re interested in having more say in what the Fed does. In the end, all of this is a dilemma for both the Fed and for Democrats. By September, we might see unemployment rising too fast and more people out of work. The Fed will likely feel they have no choice but to cut. But at that point, it’s possible voters will be worrying about their jobs more than (still) high prices — or both. So when and if we see the Fed cut interest rates, prepare yourself for a lot of political noise in the final weeks before November’s election.

Biden has a good idea for fixing the Supreme Court. This is an even better one.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 2:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-supreme-court-term-limit-proposal-better-rcna164608,"President Joe Biden’s announcement Monday that a Supreme Court justice’s lifetime tenure needs to end is absolutely justified, but his suggestion to institute 18-year term limits for the justices is not the best solution. Rather, requiring Supreme Court justices to return to the Senate every decade for votes — to determine whether they are retained for another 10 years or are dismissed — would promote much-needed accountability while allowing able justices to continue to serve. This concept is a hybrid variation of a well-established procedure in many states. As of last year, 23 states required judges on their highest courts to be candidates in elections in which voters decide whether they should continue in office or not.    Letting voters decide makes sense in state judiciaries. In 24 states, judges in the states’ highest courts take office only after winning in partisan or nonpartisan elections. In other states, the judges are appointed. Candidates to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, in contrast, are confirmed by majority vote in the U.S. Senate after having been nominated by the president.  Conferring on the Senate, which confirmed justices originally, the duty to decide whether justices merit retention comports with the Constitution’s original allocation of authority. Requiring a sitting justice, after a decade on the bench, to return to the Senate for a retention vote would vastly promote accountability.  And accountability is badly needed now to rein in the current court’s aggressive agenda to overturn existing rights and cast long-standing precedents aside to satisfy the political agenda of its conservative majority. Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck described how, in the last term, the Supreme Court massively increased the power of the presidency and the ability of judges to overturn decisions made by federal regulators. If, in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a nominee conceals (or even misleads) senators about judicial philosophy to gain confirmation, there are no consequences once the justice takes office. In his confirmation hearing, Brett Kavanaugh testified that Roe v. Wade, recognizing the constitutional right to abortion, was settled law. “It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis,” Kavanaugh said. The legal principle “stare decisis” refers to a court’s applying prior decisions when ruling on a similar issue — a foundational rule, which the current Supreme Court has flouted in key decisions. Another nominee of former President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch, testified similarly in his confirmation hearing. “I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed,” he said. “A good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.” Kavanaugh and Gorsuch in 2022, joined by three other conservative justices, overruled Roe v. Wade. At least two senators who voted to confirm both men, Republican Susan Collins, of Maine, and Democrat-turned-independent Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, indicated they had been misled. The retention process promotes accountability for such behavior. Justices would be required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain how their subsequent rulings conformed to sworn testimony given during their confirmation processes. If a majority of the Senate is dissatisfied with their explanations about the differences between their testimony and their subsequent actions, the Senate could refuse to retain them. Another option for the Senate would be to decide not to retain a justice for any other reason, including ethical breaches, incompetence, failing mental acuity, political agendas or other relevant behavior.  Biden’s term limits proposal fails to promote accountability. If every justice is removed after 18 years, the sitting justices have the same degree of freedom from accountability that they possess today. They never are called to account for false statements in the confirmation process or ethical breaches or gross application of the Constitution, as in the court’s recent immunity decision allowing a president to act as a criminal without consequences. The threat of opprobrium resulting if a justice were discharged by a Senate vote of non-retention alone could be a major deterrent against misconduct by a sitting Supreme Court justice. Moreover, term limits throw out good justices and bad justices alike. The retention process allows judgments to be made by the Senate, which can retain in office those who are worthy of another decade on the bench. Some may object that a retention vote would inject too much political consideration — for example, by failing to retain a justice initially nominated by the political party then in the minority.  But the initial confirmation is highly political already. In its role in confirming nominees, the majority party in the Senate regularly has the deciding say. In recognition of this reality, the makeup of the current court is a campaign issue now. Eighteen years is a long time. Having an opportunity to assess the service of justices at 10-year intervals would allow for earlier retirements for those justices not worthy of staying in office. Both Biden’s proposal and this one would require a constitutional amendment. Given that arduous path, a remedy that ensures judicial accountability should be preferred.

Trump's federal election interference case is back with Judge Chutkan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 1:26 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-federal-election-case-chutkan-immunity-rcna164930,"The federal election interference prosecution against Donald Trump is finally back in the trial court. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan can now apply the Supreme Court’s ruling bestowing broad criminal immunity on former presidents to Trump’s case, to see what’s left of it after the high court imposed a new and murky immunity test. It’s unclear what precise form that complex project will take — whether with written briefs, hearings or a combination of the two. What’s clear is that a trial won’t happen before November’s presidential election and that if Trump wins that election then his federal cases are good as gone (special counsel Jack Smith is appealing Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the other federal case, regarding classified documents and obstruction). In the July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States, Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion said the court is sending the case back to Chutkan to decide “in the first instance” how the immunity test applies to Trump’s case. Recall that the ruling said former presidents are entitled to at least presumptive immunity for all “official acts.” It’s now on the lower court to figure out whether some of his alleged conduct in trying to subvert the 2020 election was official or unofficial, and whether prosecutors can rebut the presumption of immunity for certain official acts. As an example of what Chutkan must decide, Roberts noted that she needs to examine, “with appropriate input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Whatever Chutkan decides may be appealed again to the justices before any trial can happen, further making any pre-election trial impracticable. The bigger question now is, if Trump loses in November, what will remain of the indictment after it’s fully litigated through the courts, which could take months at least. The case, which was previously set for a March trial, had been on hold while Trump pressed his immunity appeal. Adding another variable, the immunity opinion also noted the Supreme Court’s ruling this past term in Fischer v. United States that narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants. As Trump is charged with obstruction-related counts, among others, Roberts’ ruling said in a footnote, referencing the obstruction statute: “If necessary, the District Court should determine in the first instance whether the Section 1512(c)(2) charges may proceed in light of our decision in Fischer.” We’ll likely know the next steps in the case through Chutkan’s docket, where she may issue an order telling the parties how she’ll proceed.

Judge suspends Justin Timberlake's driver's license after singer declined sobriety test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 1:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/justin-timberlake-driver-license-suspended-arrest-dwi-rcna164909,"A judge has suspended pop singer Justin Timberlake's New York driver's license because he declined to take a breathalyzer test after he was pulled over and arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated in June. Sag Harbor Justice Carl Irace on Friday ordered the suspension of the singer's license in a virtual court hearing, in accordance with New York state law. Timberlake’s lawyer, Ed Burke, told NBC News that the suspension is in place for the duration of the court case. Timberlake called into the hearing from Antwerp, Belgium, where he is scheduled to perform this weekend as part of his ""Forget Tomorrow World Tour."" The 43-year-old pop star has pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor. Irace also reprimanded Burke for comments he made last week and threatened him with a gag order. Burke had told reporters outside of court that Sag Harbor Police had made “very significant errors” in the case and that he expected charges to be dismissed. “It comes off as an attempt to poison the case before it even begins,” Irace told the lawyer. Timberlake was arrested in the village of Sag Harbor, New York, on June 18. According to the criminal complaint, Timberlake told a police officer that he'd only had one martini and was following some friends home. Timberlake also declined to take a chemical test to determine his level of sobriety, which NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos explained ""can be introduced at trial to establish conscious evidence of guilt."" The officer noted in the complaint a slew of other behaviors from Timberlake that suggested an inebriated state, including being ""unable to divide attention,"" slowed speech, unsteady footing, ""bloodshot and glassy"" eyes and breath that smelled of alcohol."
I was elected my town’s first Black mayor. Then they changed the locks on the town hall.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 12:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/alabama-towns-first-black-mayor-speaks-rcna164416,"For almost 60 years, the positions of mayor and Town Council member in my small town of Newbern, Alabama, were “handed down” by white residents to other residents. Newbern is a small and majority-Black town, yet Black residents could not remember a single election for those positions. Almost four years ago, I ran for office. I was excited to become the town’s mayor-elect and appoint a representative Town Council to govern our community. But as the first Black person elected mayor of Newbern, I immediately ran into obstacles. The locks were changed on the town hall, and officials refused to give me access to the town’s finances. Soon after I was elected, the outgoing Town Council claimed that it held a special election to fill vacant seats and that only white people had won. But I did not know about this election and had not had an opportunity to participate in it. Nor had any of the other people who filed a lawsuit with me. Last week, my dreams and the dreams of many other residents of Newbern became a reality. After a hard-fought court battle challenging the town’s practice of not holding elections for decades, a federal judge signed off on a settlement between Black Newbern residents, including me, and the town. Newbern will finally have a democratic process. After a dispute about the town’s leadership that lasted four years, I will serve as the first Black mayor of Newbern. As a lifelong resident of Newbern and a descendant of those who had no access to the ballot, I firmly believe in exercising and protecting my fundamental right to vote. Voting is an opportunity and responsibility in helping to shape the direction, priorities and vision of our communities. Voting should not be a privilege for some; it should be a right afforded to all. This outcome is a victory for the town of Newbern, and it speaks to the dedication of Newbern residents to make their voices heard. But our battle was bigger than our town. It speaks to the importance of upholding democracy across the nation. It also reveals that in many places across the country, we have not progressed far enough and Black folks are still being denied true equality. We must stay civically engaged, work to dismantle the obvious and not-so-obvious forms of voter suppression, and recognize the power that comes with just one of us demanding a change to the status quo. Newbern is my home. And I, along with other fellow residents, refused to give in to the discrimination that prevented us, for decades, from being civically engaged in our community. That discrimination meant we were rarely a part of decisions that affected our everyday lives — from how our streets were cleaned to whether we had access to public spaces such as the town hall. There exists a long and painful history of voter suppression across the nation. Pervasive voter suppression tactics, such as literacy tests, poll taxes and intimidation, were used to keep Black Americans and other marginalized communities from engaging in the civic process. For generations, Black people have had to fight for their fundamental right to vote and participate in democracy. We have met these challenges with clarity of what is just and ready to surmount the darkest of circumstances. We have shown up to the polls, demanding to have a say in the country we have had a significant role in building and shaping. Landmark legislation like the federal Voting Rights Act has been essential in ensuring that all people, regardless of race or background, are heard. Today, contemporary challenges to voting access continue to make this an ongoing fight. As we witness the unprecedented attacks on voting rights across Alabama, the South and the nation, we must take a stand and continue to make our voices heard. A new day has dawned for Newbern. I am as excited now as I was almost four years ago when I ran. I intend to work with the residents of Newbern to make sure that every single person in our town is invested in, listened to and supported. As a part of the agreement between the parties, I submitted names to the governor of both Black and white residents to fill the open Town Council positions. As a mayor and a citizen, I vow to work with the new Town Council to ensure that justice and equality for all are upheld and achieved. We must fight for voting rights until everyone everywhere is able to exercise their fundamental right and have a say in their own communities. By supporting state and federal voting rights legislation, exercising our right to vote and staying engaged with our local representatives, we can make a difference. Every single one of us is entitled to be a part of creating the future and legacy of the country, state and town we call home."
The well-intentioned Kids Online Safety Act is ripe for MAGA exploitation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 12:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kids-online-safety-act-ron-wyden-rcna164576,"Protecting kids online shouldn’t mean making some kids safer while putting others in harm’s way. That’s why earlier this week I voted against the Kids Online Safety Act, a well-intentioned bill that unfortunately pairs important privacy and design protections with new censorship powers. I fear that these authorities could be abused by a MAGA administration to target our most vulnerable children and the technologies, like encryption, that keep them safe.  Unfortunately, KOSA and another bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, together passed the Senate on an overwhelming vote. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle congratulated themselves on standing up to Big Tech, even though many of the biggest technology and social media companies, including Microsoft, Snap and X, endorsed the bill. Together, the package contained three elements: one, a laudable children’s privacy bill by my friend Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., which I had co-sponsored; two, a similarly important proposal creating new regulations against the use of unsafe and addictive designs by social media companies; and three, the creation of a “duty of care” for companies that could allow the Federal Trade Commission to sue businesses that recommend content that could harm children’s mental health.  The first two elements help all children minimize the potential for collateral harm and are largely uncontroversial. But the “duty of care” has earned opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union, Fight For the Future, Advocates for Youth and dozens of other advocates for free speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  These groups fear that the duty of care could be used to pressure social media companies to censor information the administration in power doesn’t like, including LGBTQ+ content, reproductive health information, or other topics that regulators could decide harm kids’ mental health. That is of special concern in light of former President Donald Trump’s efforts to make it easier to purge federal employees and replace them with political operatives. While the bill’s authors have attempted to limit abuse by linking causes of action to mental health disorders, I fear that will not be sufficient to constrain culture warriors on the far right. For example, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has suggested that not having children is linked to mental illness and has repeatedly claimed that “childless cat ladies” and single adults may be less mentally fit and worthy citizens than other Americans.  “You know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable,” Vance said in 2020. “And of course, you talk about going on Twitter — final point I’ll make is you go on Twitter and almost always the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don’t have kids at home.” Someone like that has no business deciding what information Americans can or cannot see on the internet. The Heritage Foundation, architects of the dangerous and bizarre Project 2025 plan for a future Republican president, last year argued that KOSA should be used to keep trans content away from kids in the name of protecting their mental health. It is no stretch to see these crusaders for medieval values using this legislation to censor reproductive health information and discussions by and about LGBTQ+ people.  It is unfortunate that once again, Congress is faced with a well-intentioned, yet flawed, tech legislation. The last major tech bill Congress passed was SESTA-FOSTA, enacted in 2018 with the stated goal of stopping sex trafficking online by creating new liability for tech companies. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and I were the only members to vote against that bill.  I warned at the time that bill would do little to catch predators or help victims, and would only drive sex work to darker corners of the web, or the streets. Unfortunately, I’ve been proved right. After SESTA-FOSTA, violence against sex workers increased dramatically. The Government Accountability Office found that SESTA-FOSTA did virtually nothing to stop sex trafficking. Instead, it caused all kinds of information that had nothing to do with sex trafficking to be censored from the internet. Instead of passing flawed legislation like SESTA and KOSA, Congress should take on Big Tech for real, and pass legislation that will deliver for children’s safety. I’ve proposed legislation to ban all surveillance advertising and outlaw the toxic business model fueling the worst behavior online. I’ve also proposed bipartisan legislation to spend $5 billion to help protect kids from becoming victims of trafficking, and to find and prosecute the criminals who prey on children.  This is undoubtedly a deeply personal issue to many Americans. I am deeply thankful to everyone who has weighed in on KOSA, from advocates to parents to young people, both for and against the bill. And I am thankful that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-WA, worked with me and advocates to improve the bill, including reducing the powers MAGA attorneys general would have under this legislation. The result was a meaningfully better bill. But it was not enough.  Now KOSA goes to the House for its consideration. It is not too late to prevent MAGA politicians from exploiting KOSA to help wage a dangerous and retrograde culture war. It’s not too late to bolster platforms’ protections for responsible use of technologies like encryption and anonymous accounts. It is not too late for Congress to work together to pass better legislation that makes all kids safer online. "
Latest fentanyl seizure doesn’t do GOP talking points any favors,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 11:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/latest-fentanyl-seizure-doesnt-gop-talking-points-favors-rcna164910,"In his latest Fox Business interview, Donald Trump was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris’ potential running mates. “I don’t care,” the Republican responded. “Let them do whatever; they still want to have open borders.” The “open borders” line was obviously gratuitous and unnecessary. It was also, of course, factually wrong. While we're at it, let's not forget that it's also rather ironic given Trump's direct role in killing a bipartisan compromise deal that would've imposed the conservative border policies the GOP claims to want. (As one Senate Republican conceded in January, the bipartisan deal, which was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, ""would have had almost unanimous Republican support if it weren’t for Donald Trump.”) But it was also poorly timed, as evidenced by the latest Arizona Republic report. A CPB press release, issued yesterday, this seizure resulted from an American citizen who crossed the border, obtained the fentanyl, and allegedly tried to smuggle them into the United States by packing them to the frame of a sport recreational vehicle. “While conducting a thorough inspection of the pick-up truck, trailer, and sport utility vehicle, CBP officers noticed anomalies throughout the frame of the trailer,” the statement added. “With the assistance of a CBP canine team, officers discovered 234 packages of drugs concealed within the frame of a trailer. The packages contained approximately 4 million blue fentanyl pills, which is the largest fentanyl seizure in CBP history.” This roughly coincided with CBP officials also seizing 270 pounds of meth that suspected smugglers were trying to bring onto American soil. It also coincided with fresh good news about the efficacy of the Biden administration's border policies. As The New Republic’s Greg Sargent reported: I realize that for the former president and his party, the repetition of the “open borders” phrase is habitual to the point of being mindless. For all intents and purposes, Republicans no longer know or care if the claim is true — or was ever true. It’s simply what the party has decided voters are supposed to believe. But as the latest evidence makes clear, the GOP’s talking points are overdue for a rewrite."
Why a panel said Jeff Clark should be barred from law practice for two years,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 9:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeff-clark-barred-law-license-dc-rcna164835,"A disciplinary counsel in Washington, D.C., argued that Donald Trump ally Jeffrey Clark should lose his law license. Clark argued that he shouldn’t be disciplined at all. Rejecting both contentions, the committee panel that heard evidence on the matter recommended Thursday that Clark should be suspended from practicing law for two years. With such strikingly different positions on each side, how did the panel reach that conclusion? While rejecting Clark’s claim that he essentially did nothing wrong, the panel said that, based on the evidence presented in the proceeding, his conduct wasn’t as egregious as that of Rudy Giuliani or John Eastman, whose respective disbarments were recommended in other proceedings for their 2020 election-related actions. Specifically, the panel explained in a lengthy report that the disciplinary counsel proved “by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Clark attempted dishonesty and did so with truly extraordinary recklessness.” It recounted that Clark, an environmental and civil litigator during the Trump administration, had no criminal or election experience and yet: Distinguishing Clark’s matter from Giuliani’s, the panel wrote that Giuliani “abused his license to practice law and breached his core ethical duties” in the context of representing a client in court, while Clark’s misconduct “did not involve the courts” but rather “occurred in the context of high-level discussion and debate within the Executive Branch regarding the integrity of the 2020 election, and did not involve an attempt to mislead others within the Justice Department.” Similarly, regarding Eastman, the panel noted that the California bar “found that, in connection with efforts to challenge the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, Dr. Eastman failed to support the Constitution and laws of the United States, and engaged in pervasive dishonesty, including knowingly false and misleading statements in court filings.” The recommendation doesn’t mean that Clark necessarily will be suspended for two years. Politico reported that it “will now come before the D.C. Bar’s Board of Professional Responsibility, which will make its own recommendation to the D.C. Court of Appeals. The full process could take another year to reach its conclusion.” Clark also faces related criminal charges in Georgia, alongside Trump and others in a state indictment alleging 2020 election interference. Both Clark and Trump have pleaded not guilty in the case, which is currently tied up on a pretrial appeal seeking to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. If Trump wins the presidential election in November, he wouldn’t be able to pardon state charges. And rather than attempt a legally untested self-pardon for his federal cases if he retakes the White House, Trump might instead have his newly installed attorney general — possibly Clark himself — dismiss them.

"Eyeing another Trump term, Vance leaves ACA repeal on the table",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 9:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-aca-repeal-affordable-care-act-obamacare-election-2024-rcna164892,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign announced this week that it’s investing $50 million in support of a new television ad called “Fearless.” It’s a good 30-second spot, with a fairly straightforward message. Viewers are told (a) about the Democrat’s background as a prosecutor; (b) Donald Trump’s plan to give more tax breaks to the rich; and (c) Republican plans to end the Affordable Care Act. The commercial wraps up with Harris declaring, “We are not going back.” The fact that the ad specifically referenced the ACA might’ve surprised some viewers. After all, when we think about the hot-button issues that are dominating the public discourse this year, health care isn’t widely seen as one of them. But Democrats clearly hope to change that, and the candidates on the Republican Party’s presidential ticket occasionally lend a hand. Sen. JD Vance, for example, spoke with NOTUS this week, and the report noted, the Ohio Republican “suggested repealing Obamacare would still be a priority” if voters return Trump to power. The report added that Vance went on to say in the same interview that the Trump-era “repeal and replace efforts” were “fundamentally focused around the idea of fixing what was broken, not about stripping people’s health care away. So yeah, I think you’re certainly gonna see efforts to reform the system. Obviously, what that looks like will depend a little bit on Congress because Congress has to have a role to play.” As a substantive matter, Vance’s assessment didn’t make a lot of sense. His condemnation of the ACA — which he’s too inexperienced to have voted on — not only misdiagnoses the existing challenges surrounding the Affordable Care Act, it also badly misstates what transpired during Trump’s first term. But looking ahead, what arguably matters most about Vance’s comments was the fact that he left little doubt in a Trump second term, Americans should “certainly” expect a prospective Republican White House to “reform” the nation’s health care system. “Donald Trump and JD Vance are the greatest threat to Americans’ health care today,” Harris for President spokesperson James Singer said in a statement, responding to the NOTUS interview. “Terminating the Affordable Care Act has been Trump’s goal for years, which will make America sicker, rip away preexisting condition protections from more than 100 million Americans, and increase health care costs. ... The stakes this November couldn’t be higher for the American people.” The problem, of course, goes well beyond Vance and his latest comments. Indeed, Trump largely ignored the ACA after leaving the White House, but as regular readers know, the former president had targeted Obamacare in increasingly explicit terms over the past year, and as recently as December, the Republican posted a video to his social media platform attacking the late Sen. John McCain for not helping him “terminate” the ACA in 2017. Trump soon after vowed to tear down the nation’s existing health care system and replace it with something he said would be “better” — though his assurances didn’t include any details. What’s more, as we’ve discussed, some of his congressional allies have added their voices to this debate. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told Axios in late November, “I think Obamacare has been one of the biggest deceptions on the American people. I mean just look at your health care premiums.” (Premium costs, in reality, have gone down, not up.) The same report added that Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, who’d likely chair the Senate Finance Committee if the GOP retakes control of the chamber, also said he’s open to repeal-and-replace plans. Remember, the Republicans’ 2017 effort to tear down the ACA was a disaster for the party, which Democrats exploited to help take back the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats would love little more than to have this fight again in 2024 — a recent national survey from NBC News found the party with a 23-point advantage over the GOP on health care — which made Vance’s comments this week all the more significant. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

"Trump was late to NABJ interview because he didn't want to be fact-checked, group's president says",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 8:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-nabj-interview-fact-check-delay-rcna164845,"Donald Trump's appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday got off to such a late start because he did not want to be fact-checked live, NABJ President Ken Lemon told Axios. Trump's interview was delayed by more than an hour, and at the time he blamed audio issues for the holdup. ""The speaker equipment at the NABJ is not working properly. Don’t blame me for being late!"" he posted on Truth Social. The technical issues were apparent during the interview, but Lemon told Axios that they ""were resolved very quickly."" Yet, Trump still refused to go on stage if he was going to be fact-checked, Lemon said. “The bigger problem was his threat not to take the stage when he had agreed to go on,"" Lemon added. ""He did not want to be fact-checked, but we could not let him on the stage without fact-checking."" Lemon's comments square with previous reporting that the interview was delayed because Trump objected to the live fact-check shortly before the event began. Lemon told Axios he was preparing to announce that Trump would not appear because of the fact-checking dispute when the GOP nominee walked on stage. The Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, disputed Lemon's explanation for the delay to Axios, saying that Trump waited ""for close to 40 minutes while audio/technical issues were fixed by NABJ."" ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott attempted to push back on several of Trump's lies onstage, though he repeatedly talked over the interviewers. The interview's late start seemed to set the tone for Trump's antagonistic approach to what my colleague Ja’han Jones described as a “car crash of an event.” Trump — whose campaign has been trying to win over Black voters — repeatedly attacked Scott and ABC News. He lied exhaustively, and he ranted and deflected when asked straightforward questions. He also unveiled a confounding new line of attack on Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning her biracial identity and accusing her of not really being Black."
Prisoner deal undermines one of Trump’s attack lines against Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 8:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prisoner-deal-undermines-one-trumps-attack-lines-harris-rcna164870,"Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, and when the host started to ask how international leaders would respond to a Kamala Harris presidency, the Republican interrupted before she was even done with the question. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be like a play toy.” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” In context, the implicit racism and sexism in the on-air comments seemed obvious. The fact that Trump was an international laughingstock during his White House tenure didn’t help matters, either. But the idea that Harris wouldn’t be taken seriously on the international stage was also discredited by reality soon after Trump made his ugly remarks. The Wall Street Journal reported: The Journal’s report added that Harris had met Scholz previously on several occasions, and as an administration official put it, the vice president had a “good working relationship with him.” That’s “part of the reason why she was able to have a really good, frank conversation with him.” A White House official also confirmed with NBC News that when it came to the difficult international process, Harris “moved the ball forward significantly.” Note, Harris hadn’t met Slovenia’s Golob before this year’s Munich Security Conference, and as the Journal’s report noted, “Their meeting was the highest-level U.S. engagement at the time with the Slovenian government, which was holding two Russian nationals Moscow wanted released. That meeting was also restricted to just Harris, Golob and two aides.” Slovenia soon after agreed to participate in the international deal, which is what happens when foreign officials take U.S. officials seriously."
"Loving her 'Black job,' Simone Biles appears to throw shade at Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 7:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/loving-black-job-simone-biles-appears-throw-shade-trump-rcna164862,"As a rule, American politicians tend to root for American athletes at the Olympics. It’s a rule Donald Trump hasn’t always followed. Exactly three years ago this week, for example, the former president lashed out at the U.S. women’s soccer team after they “only” won Bronze medals. “If our soccer team, headed by a radical group of Leftist Maniacs, wasn’t woke, they would have won the Gold Medal instead of the Bronze,” the Republican declared in a written statement. “Woke means you lose, everything that is woke goes bad, and our soccer team certainly has.” Trump added that he wanted to see “Patriots” replace “the wokesters” in future games, suggesting Americans should root not for their country’s athletes, but rather, for conservatives and against liberals. But as it turns out, sometimes Trump sends barbed messages to Olympians, while other times Olympians send barbed messages to Trump. NBC News reported: “Simone Biles being the GOAT, winning Gold medals and dominating gymnastics is her black job,” Davila wrote. “I love my black job,” Biles responded, adding a black heart emoji. To be sure, the gold medalist did not specifically reference the GOP candidate online, but the ""black job” reference was hardly subtle. Trump is, after all, responsible for pushing the phrase into the political lexicon: The former president first used the line during a debate in late June, and he elaborated on this at a National Association of Black Journalists conference this week. It’s tempting to think Trump’s running mate might want to come to his rescue in this instance, but given his own rhetorical history, I think Sen. JD Vance probably ought to sit this one out. The New York Times reported: “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” Vance said at the time. If the Republicans’ 2024 ticket is smart, Trump and Vance will let Biles’ latest comments go without notice. If recent history is any guide, however, the former president seems likely to start another feud. Watch this space."
"Returning to his roots, Trump promotes Harris’ birth certificate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 7:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-promotes-kamala-harris-birth-certificate-election-2024-rcna164848,"The headline on a Punchbowl News report on Thursday stood out: “It’s 2016 all over again following Trump’s racist attacks on Harris.” A day earlier, a Fox News personality told viewers that there’s “2016 energy” around this year’s presidential race. A NOTUS report had a related message today: ""A woman atop the Democratic ticket. GOP lawmakers dodging the press. Trump. Birtherism. The 2024 election has a bit of everything that made 2016 memorable."" At first blush, the analysis seems compelling. In 2016, Donald Trump faced the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket; he targeted her with ugly and sexist attacks; and eight years later, the Republican is recycling many of the same words and phrases as he prepares to face the second woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket. All the while, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pretending to have no idea what Trump is saying, which is similarly reminiscent of what the political world saw during his 2016 candidacy. But to fully appreciate the scope of the former president’s ridiculous antics, perhaps it’s best to look back even further — not to 2016, but to 2010. Trump has spent much of the week questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial and ethnic identity, suggesting the nation’s first Black vice president might not be Black enough by his standards. But as a New York Times report noted, the Republican nominee went even further yesterday. Yes, the conspiracy theorist who helped pioneer the racist “birther” attacks against Barack Obama — several years before he came down the escalator and took over GOP politics — has decided, more than a decade later, to once again take an interest in another Black candidate’s birth certificate. As Off Message's Brian Beutler argued, this is less like 2016 and more like what voters would've heard ""if Trump had challenged Obama in 2012 as a birtherism dead-ender."" The Washington Post asked Loomer yesterday whether she's the one who brought this line of attack to Trump’s attention. “Probably,” the right-wing personality replied, noting that she’d shared the image with the former president. Common sense suggests Trump, given his ridiculous antics targeting Obama's background, should steer clear of even passing references to birth certificates, but evidently, he can’t seem to help himself."

Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, and welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Thursday afternoon on August 1st. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m here with my co-pilot, Claire McCaskill. Hi, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Hey, it’s so much more fun now. Isn’t it? Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, I just feel like there’s so much lightness in my voice and I know. Claire McCaskill: I mean, true confession, I would dread this moment in the week a few weeks ago, like, oh my God, I’ve got to talk about it and I’m so depressed. And now it’s like, man, spring in my step. We are hitting on all cylinders. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. I know. Claire McCaskill: I haven’t felt this good since, you know, the same time in 2008. Jennifer Palmieri: And it feels, it’s not just, oh, you feel good for the vice president. It’s like, you’re proud of President Biden -- Claire McCaskill: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: -- for making this possible. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: You feel good about the Democrats because our leader had a problem, and he dealt with it in like the most generous, courageous way possible. And it just all feels great, so. Claire McCaskill: Speaking of our leader, let’s give him some props right now for -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- an amazing development that happened today that is 100% Joe Biden. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, it’s that three Americans and one permanent U.S. resident were among those freed from Russian captivity today, and one of the biggest prisoner exchanges since the Cold War. “Wall Street Journal” reporter Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan are among the prisoners released. And it’s, yeah, it’s such great news. We send our best to them and their families, their loved ones. And Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, just briefed at the White House, and he talks about how even as Jake was briefing, President Biden was calling leaders of the countries that were part of the prisoner swap to thank them. And he said, it’s just vintage Biden just leveraging America’s allies in a way that, you know, only he can do and has really been a defining feature of his presidency. And I love even Jake got a little choked up, which he never does. So great. Claire McCaskill: And what is really notable is we learned in the coverage of the release today that an hour before President Biden did the selfless and patriotic thing and declared himself no longer running for president, an hour before that, he was on the phone with Slovenia doing what only the president of the United States can do. And that is leveraging our strong relationship and ties with countries to move the needle when it really matters to America. So all of you folks out there think isolationism is the way forward, that all of you who are buying what J.D. Vance is selling and to some extent even Donald Trump, that somehow America doesn’t need anybody else in the world, but America, pay attention here. We need others in the world for us to be safe and for American citizens to be safe as they travel around the world. So this is a really good moment for President Joe Biden. He’s had a lot lately, but this is certainly among one of the tops he’s had this year. Jennifer Palmieri: And before we get deep into the show today, we want to tell you about MSNBC Premium.

Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, and now on to today’s episode, the countdown is on. Oh, my God, there’s only 96 days left to the election. And the DNC virtual convention begins today with 99 percent of the delegates signing Vice President Kamala Harris’s nomination petition. Claire McCaskill: And as I referenced earlier, Kamala is making politics fun again. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We’re going to talk about the messaging that is emerging from her campaign and contrast it with the dark, ugly underbelly of Trump’s message, which has been made quite plain in the last 24 hours. I mean, I’m like watching that thing yesterday. This is when he appeared in front of the National Association of Black Journalists. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And like every answer he gave, I was like, are you kidding me? Is this guy serious? Does he really think this helps him get votes he doesn’t have now? It was really something. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. I mean, and then he posted some crazy stuff on Truth Social today. Some crazy photo as a little follow up as well. And later in this episode, Claire will spend some time with the head of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, for a deep dive on what reproductive freedom looks like in 2024. They’ll explain where abortion is most severely restricted, how Trump’s Project 2025 thinks about women’s basic health care decisions and what it’s like on the ground for women who need care in states with abortion bans, even in emergencies. But first to today’s strategy session, 96 days. Claire McCaskill: And you know, this is what we usually do if I were in the room. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, I just think it’s going to be really hard for us to do that segment this week because they’re doing everything right. I mean, what can we tell them at this point? Jennifer Palmieri: There’s no second guessing we can do now. Oh, it’s just plenty. Claire McCaskill: I mean, seriously. Listen, they were ready, and it shows she was ready, and it shows. I mean, it really is like stepping off the edge of a cliff when you go from the life she was leading day to day to the life she is leading now. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: As well as anybody. Jen, you have been at the side of a presidential candidate. You know what the pressure is like. Jennifer Palmieri: Particularly when you’re running against this guy. Claire McCaskill: Particularly running against this guy. But she’s got her pace. She seems happy and joyful and confident. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I even have noticed, this is something when you’re a practitioner, you notice these things. I don’t think people understand how hard it is when you are in front of a raucous crowd, how your timing is off, how you pause, how you let the crowd organically rise up and lift you. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: How you wait for that to happen. How you calm them down to try to get to the substantive things you want to say. She has been working her crowds like she is a symphony conductor. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It has really, really been good. And that is not an easy skill. Anybody who’s watched people do it badly know it feels like you’re riding in a bumper car. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know. Whereas this was just smooth and organic and natural. And man, it’s fun to watch. Jennifer Palmieri: And like all good performances, she makes it look easy, but it’s all happening at the right time. And she’s doing a great job prosecuting the case against Trump and the GOP is hitting her on immigration, calling her the border czar, something she never was. Trump’s first campaign ad against her called her and calling her the border czar and blaming her for the border crisis. And then her ad back, I was like, yes, you know, it’s just there’s a lightness to this campaign. You know, it’s joyful. And the notion of not getting bogged down, not getting overwhelmed or giving too much power to the Trump MAGA side by making them scary and fearful, you know, as opposed to just weird. I feel like that has sort of taken the temperature down. And then also to just dismiss out of hand as the Harris campaign ad on immigration does. You know, it’s like there’s a solution on the border, on the table, and you’re the one who killed it. You know, just like boom, right back at them. And that’s supposed to be their big thing, right? That was supposed to be their big issue against them. And she turns it on offense, as you should do, because they are completely full of it. Claire McCaskill: I mean, we could actually go back and pull audio from our early podcast when we were talking about how important it was for the Democrats to play offense on immigration. And this is the best defense is offense. And she is taking a page right out of the Trump marketing guide, which is go after your opponent on their perceived strengths. And that’s what he’s trying to do, but it is exactly what she should be doing with him. And she can do the same thing on energy. She can do the same thing on jobs. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: She can do the same thing on crime because the facts are on her side. And so I love this aggressive going after and every time he comes after her, she’s okay, let’s go. Let’s go. Jennifer Palmieri: And then the National Association of Black Journalists, which, you know, she noted with in the opening was just a bizarre performance from Trump. But the thing I think in the room that goes to their strategy that I want to talk about, it’s this banger from him saying that the vice president only recently turned black. (BEGIN VT) Donald Trump: She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black. And now she wants to be known as black. So I don’t know. Is she Indian or is she black? Unidentified Female: She is always identified as a black. Donald Trump: But you know what, I respect either one. I respect either one. But she obviously doesn’t because she was Indian all the way. And then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she became a black person. Unidentified Female: Just to be clear, sir. Do you believe that she is? (END VT) Jennifer Palmieri: So I had a reporter reach out to me to say just off the record, just wanted to know saying some people thought that this move was just Trump being Trump and just, you know, spewing stuff that comes to the top of his mind or was it a deliberate act to sort of poke at her race? And I think it was a deliberate act. This is what he does. You know, Maggie Haberman noted he only has a few plays, and he does them over and over again. He was hoping, I think, to provoke a larger fight about race to cynically reaffirm for people who are uncomfortable with race or a biracial woman. And the campaign did not engage in that way. Their smart response was, this is just a little snippet of all the kind of crazy MAGA stuff you hear him say at every single rally. The vice president, she was giving a speech last night before a black sorority. She said it was more disrespect, but not presenting it as something new. And what does that fit under the frame of? We’re not going back, right? This is what he does and we’re not going back. I think they were hoping to draw out a bigger fight about race. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. My theory is, first of all, he wasn’t going to get more votes where he needs to get them by doing it. So it doesn’t help him with those swing voters in battleground states. It really wasn’t going to convince more MAGA people to be more MAGA. And so my theory is he was doing it to try to get the conversation off Kamala Harris and back on Donald Trump. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: That he was trying to do something outrageous that would get us all talking about him because he is losing it because we’ve gone for a week and nobody’s paying any attention to him. So I think this was a desperate play to try to get him back on air as somebody who says things you’re never supposed to say. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. And that used to be his strength, right? Claire McCaskill: Yeah. That used to be his strength. And it worked, but in a limited fashion because of the way the campaign handled it. I think her continuing to attack him on him being afraid is so smart, too. I wanted to mention that because -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- we’ve talked many times on this podcast about if I were in the room, I would be trying to get them to emphasize strength because the only thing Donald Trump really has going for him is this perception that he’s, quote unquote, “strong.” It’s wrong. It’s an illusion. He’s not strong. And clearly, she’s got the example to show it now. He’s afraid to debate her. And it kind of wrapped up everything in my mind. What I referenced earlier, how well she’s doing with her crowds, how the messaging is strong and light and joyous. When she did the whole thing, when, you know, you have something to say to me and she smiled and she waited and you saw the crowd behind her shout, say it to my face before the words ever came out of her mouth. That shows she’s in the moment culturally. She understood that most people in that audience would know this is where you stay. Say it to my face. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And it’s one of the reasons why she’s dominating online. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I was talking to Nicolle Wallace yesterday and she was telling me her 12-year-old son, they were talking in the car, and she said, well, who’s winning the internet? He goes, oh, Kamala Harris is winning the internet right now. It’s not even close. It’s fascinating to me that culturally she can be of the moment, but still be so presidential in the way she’s handled that. And say it to my face is going to be a T-shirt if it isn’t already. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, yeah. It’s not already. Yeah, right. Like it used to be four years ago, it was I’m speaking. That was her T-shirt. Now, this is, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: This is a good evolution. Jennifer Palmieri: And then J.D. Vance, you know, he continues to have a tough time. Also, he told donors, he was in a fundraiser, I think he did not think his remarks were being recorded. But he said that the Harris change was a sucker punch for them, which is also such a weird thing to say because it was such an odds for what they were campaigning for, you know, what they had set up their campaign to be. Claire McCaskill: And he’s trying to run from the childless cat lady stuff. But it’s now surfaced three or four different ways. We have audio of him on a podcast in November 2020. We want to share. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) J.D. VANCE: Just these basic cadences of life that I think are really powerful and really, really valuable when you have kids in your life. And the fact that so many people, especially in America’s leadership class, just don’t have that in their lives. You know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less mentally stable. (END AUDIO CLIP) Claire McCaskill: So he went there. He basically called people who don’t have children, sociopaths. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And if people haven’t seen Trey Gowdy’s introduction of him on Fox News -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, it’s so good. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It was so good. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, when you have Trey Gowdy, I mean, a MAGA guy, basically take him to task by pointing out that he made friends with two nuns in an airport who had spent their life giving back and that somehow J.D. Vance didn’t understand that their value to our society is just as much, in fact, in many ways more than people who have children. So it’s what he believes. It’s what he believes. So he can’t really run from it. And obviously, Trump had a hard time explaining that yesterday when he was asked about it. I bet they’re regretting the J.D. Vance pick. If I were in the room, I’d say stay on J.D. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. And it’s interesting to me. You know that Trump is in trouble when the Fox anchors are trying to backpedal. You know, Trey Gowdy had that big windup to show that he wasn’t agreeing with J.D. Vance. And even when one of the female anchors at Fox was interviewing Trump and he was making fun of Harris’s laugh, and she was like, well, I mean, you know, people have, you know, it’s good for people to laugh. Even she’s trying to distance herself. But also, we’re not getting cocky friends because I have been here before. This feels very much like the moment in October of 2016 after the “Access Hollywood” tape and then the dozens of women that came out and accused Trump of sexual assault. And it sure looked like America would not elect that man president and they went ahead and did it anyway. And there is a large percentage in this country who will vote for him no matter what. So it’s like all great. What the Harris campaign has accomplished in about 10 days is getting her neck and neck with Trump in these battleground polls and the tough part is yet to come. Claire McCaskill: So we aren’t going to dig into all the polls this week. We’ll continue to watch them. But suffice it to say, they’re good. The swing is occurring. Battleground states, it’s still close. Like you said, there’s a lot of work to do. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: But she still has the convention, and she has the VP pick that could help even further those numbers. Let’s just guess. Let’s just guess. Who’s it going to be? Jennifer Palmieri: I think Shapiro. And if it’s not, there’s some problem. I mean, that just makes the most sense to me. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think it’s Shapiro, too. And if it’s not Shapiro, it’s one of the other governors. Jennifer Palmieri: Well -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I believe it’s one of the governors. So we’ll see. You know, we may look stupid next week, but we’ll know. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, heavens, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Well, that’ll be new. Whatever will we do? Oh, my Lord. I won’t be able to sleep at night. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, Andy Beshear. I was like, what’s the other governor? Yeah, Walz. And I just came from Kentucky. Just spent two days at a very cool farm down there. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: And this will happen soon. We’ll pause here. And when we’re back, Claire sits down with the head of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, for a detailed conversation about abortion rights and what’s at stake in this election. Trust me, you don’t want to miss this one. Back in a moment (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. While the news this week is largely focused on the seismic shift in the presidential campaign, there’s another battle that continues, and it is growing and metastasizing. This week, Iowa joined a growing list of states that bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy before many women. I might even argue most women even though they are pregnant. So we wanted to zero in on that continuing struggle for women to have the freedom to make their own health care decisions, to have access to health care and complete agency over their own bodies. To give us the sense of urgency of this fight, especially when it comes to winning November, Alexis McGill Johnson joins me now. She’s the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She’s been part of Planned Parenthood’s leadership for more than a decade and also co-founded and co-directed the Perception Institute. Welcome, Alexis. Great to have you. Alexis McGill Johnson: Thanks for having me, Claire. Good to be here. Claire McCaskill: My daughter worked for the National Office of Planned Parenthood for a number of years, and so I am always pleased to have the people who are on the front lines as part of our conversation. And by the way, I think this part of the conversation probably has more to do with the title of our podcast than maybe any other we’ve covered, and that’s “How to Win in 2024.” So especially thrilled to have you here. I know how busy you are. Let’s start with the Iowa abortion ban. Alexis McGill Johnson: Sure. Claire McCaskill: It went into effect on Monday. It joins a number of states, including my state, in banning most abortions. So let’s talk about what impact that’s going to have on the women of Iowa, because we talk about the ban, but we don’t many times look at it from a personal point of view. So what is different for a woman in Iowa who finds out she is pregnant today versus Monday? Alexis McGill Johnson: I mean, it’s devastating what happened in Iowa this week. And you’re right, it joins, you know, Florida, Texas, Missouri, and a number of states that essentially have said they don’t trust women. We are now at 22 states that have restrictions or total bans on abortion, which affects about 43% of all women, right? So just like the scale of what we are talking about right now two years after Dobbs. So what’s different is that now a woman finds out she’s pregnant, she doesn’t want to be, she has to go and try to get an appointment before six weeks. As you said, she may not know she’s pregnant at that point. She will have to seek an appointment out of state and make plans, right? She may have to make plans for travel, to take time off from work, to get up the resources, to get out of state. And that’s all if she is able to, right? You know, we have seen over the last couple of years, patients who’ve come through Planned Parenthood who are unable to get out of state. They are in relationships that are violent, they are underage, they may have an immigration status where they can’t travel. There are just so many different things that can affect just one’s movement. And now we’re asking people to go out of state to get access to care. It’s horrific. And I think what we have seen over the last couple of years is obviously abortion bans haven’t stopped people from seeking access to abortion, but we have seen abortion bans make pregnancy more dangerous. We are seeing the impact on patients who are miscarrying early. Now they have to also get access out of state. It’s really cruel and chaotic and confusing, both for the patients and for the providers. Claire McCaskill: So for the providers, let’s talk about the instance. I was traveling with my daughter, and she was 10 weeks pregnant, 11 weeks pregnant, and she suffered a miscarriage. We were in another state besides our home state, and I think about what we did and how we handled it and how she handled it and how traumatic it was, even being in a state where she was welcomed into an emergency room and got the care she needed. What is happening to women who miscarry in these states where there’s a complete ban, or where there is a limitation of, say, six weeks, like in Iowa? When they are in the process of miscarrying, are they being turned away from emergency rooms at this point? Is that what’s going on? Alexis McGill Johnson: You know, first of all, the providers are doing everything they can to try to help patients. And I think we really do have to center the experience of the patients, but also the providers who desperately want to provide the care that they need. So oftentimes they may send a patient to a parking lot to wait until, you know, essentially sepsis sets in so that they can justify under whatever exception rule or whatever medical board inside of the hospital that they can provide the care. But imagine what that means, right? Both you are sending a patient out to a parking lot for a life-threatening condition, and then you are asking a provider to call their lawyer or call the hospital administration to essentially get approval to take care of the patient. And so that’s what’s happening. We heard about it in Idaho as the U.S. government sued Idaho to enforce the EMTALA, the emergency medicine rule that abortions need to be provided in such instances. And in Idaho, they were airlifting patients out of state who were miscarrying because the providers were so worried about their own license. It’s just unspeakable. Claire McCaskill: It is unspeakable. And you know, I think about those hours where a child I love desperately was in agony for a whole lot of reasons. I mean, this was a pregnancy she really wanted, and she was traumatized. It was her first pregnancy. She was in pain. And I think about if we had been in the wrong state at that moment now after Dobbs, with these restrictions going in place, just the anger I feel that somebody would say to her to go sit in the parking lot. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And talk about violate the Hippocratic Oath, you’re supposed to do no harm. Alexis McGill Johnson: Exactly. Claire McCaskill: How does telling a woman in that situation to wait in a parking lot do no harm? Especially because it makes it feel like to the woman that somehow, she’s done something wrong. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes. Claire McCaskill: It is just infuriating. Where in the country now, so people know to be forewarned, where in the country now are the most draconian restrictions where a woman could really be in danger in terms of her health if she had a medical emergency around a pregnancy Well, I mean, you know, when you look at the map of abortion bans, right, what you see are essentially if you leave the northeast, you know, you stop in Virginia, that is the last entry point in the south where there is not a restriction. And you got to go all the way down and make a left to get to New Mexico before you can get access to care again, right. Think about the broad swath of the country, 22 states. We’re talking about Texas. We’re talking about Idaho. We’re talking about Oklahoma. We’re talking about Alabama. Florida now has a six-week ban. So the volume of patients that are having to travel, right, having to get on planes, travel upwards 18 hours by car just to get to a state where they can get access to care and all that has to go with it, right, all that has to go with it. Getting the appointment, spending the resources to find childcare, because most people who have abortions are already parents. So there’s a lot that they have to engage in just to get that access. I know there are resources that have grown since Dobbs to help women in these situations. Are there some easy places that you can point people to where they can learn about accessing some of the resources that people have generously donated? Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes. Claire McCaskill: To try to help women who are financially in a situation where travel is an impossibility for them? Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes. So we partnered with Power to Decide on abortionfinder.org, which is a kind of one-stop destination where you can find out both the state of play, right, because some of these states are being litigated and that’s the confusion of not knowing exactly what’s available in any given moment. And then also accessing abortion funds. There is a network of abortion funds that also provides care. Planned Parenthood, we have patient navigation in our affiliated network so that patients are able to call, and someone will stay with them on their journey from a banned state into a state where they can get access and help them kind of pull together the set of resources that they need. Claire McCaskill: I know a lot of states have taken things into their own hands. We saw it happen in Ohio. We saw it happen in Kansas, notably early in a state that no one, frankly, that was really the seismic shift that people began feeling that when Kansas voted the way it did to protect women and their health decisions. I know we have one on the ballot in Missouri. Missouri is not considered a battleground, unfortunately. But it’s still very important that people in Missouri know that we have an opportunity to take some freedom back that the Supreme Court snatched away. But where are the states where there are initiatives on the ballot that you believe can help? The down-ballot races, the presidential races, gubernatorial races, that people need to be aware of that these are initiatives that have, by and large, just been done by initiative petitions. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Women who are mad as hell, who have gone out and hit the bricks and gotten people to sign papers to say, we want to vote on this. It really is kind of cool. Alexis McGill Johnson: It’s been amazing to watch, right? I mean, we have everywhere where reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, we have won. And, you know, there are some key states that are going to be critical this cycle. So, first of all, Florida has a ballot initiative that also has a Senate race. We know that Florida becomes a critical access point for so many patients. And so that ballot initiative is critical. Arizona also has a Senate race and is a critical battleground state and has a ballot initiative to codify Roe. Nevada, just actually got back from Nevada this weekend. We have Senate races. We have frontline races. We have a presidential race. And we have Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, also a ballot initiative to codify Roe. We have one in Montana. Again, we have another great Senate race there. And, you know, and I don’t want to lose the fact that we had ballot initiatives in Ohio and a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin and a ballot initiative in Michigan over the last three years. So the infrastructure around fighting for reproductive freedom and connecting the dots to why it is so important to come out in ‘24 in those three states that we know are going to be critically important in the presidential. You know that infrastructure still exists, and I think the momentum that we have seen around just direct democracy, as you as you named, people who are just mad as hell, who are outraged, who cannot believe that after 49 years, a fundamental right was taken away and that our children literally are growing up with less rights than we have. And they are doing something about it. And so the energy has been really, really incredible. Claire McCaskill: Is there anything on the ballot in Texas? Alexis McGill Johnson: There is not. You know, Texas, there’s a challenge, right? At some point, we run out of states where we can engage in direct democracy, where we can engage in ballot initiatives, because they have gerrymandered their way to stay in power. And in order to get a ballot on in Texas, it has to pass threshold of 60 percent of the legislators in the statehouse. Claire McCaskill: Oh, wow. Alexis McGill Johnson: Right. So, you know, they’re finding ways. Claire McCaskill: So much for freedom. Alexis McGill Johnson: So much for freedom. Exactly. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so we’re going to talk about why the presidential race is so important to women in this country around the destruction of Roe v. Wade and the Dobbs decision. We’re going to do that right after a short break. We’re going to dig into the whole Project 2025 and the weirdness that is J.D. Vance and Donald Trump around this issue, and we’ll be right back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. I’ve been speaking with Alexis McGill Johnson, the head of Planned Parenthood. Alexis, before we let you go on your way with your life today, which I’m sure is very busy. I know you were trying to take care of your daughter before we got on the air. I want to get in here that you’re not one of those childless cat ladies that is our sociopathic enemy of the state, you know, because we know that’s something that we’re all worried about. I want to talk about Kamala Harris at the head of the ticket and I want to talk about Project 2025 and the stark contrast between those two realities. Kamala Harris has been out there on this issue, and I want to talk about her leadership on this issue and how strong she has been throughout. I think now everyone’s paying really close attention to Kamala Harris. But for those of us who care about this issue, she’s been out there leading the charge now for months on end. Alexis McGill Johnson: Oh, years. Are you kidding me? She’s not new to this. She’s true to this, as the kids say. I mean, we have been with her since before Dobbs, right? Since SB8 went into effect, you know, been on the trail with her kind of learning, kind of bringing her to our communities to meet with patients, to meet with providers, to meet with state lawmakers across the country. And she has been on a reproductive freedom tour, really a tear for the last couple of years, showing up as this administration’s kind of strongest spokesperson for what is important and possible. And, you know, as you know, being with her in the Senate, we saw her grill Justice Kavanaugh. We saw her introduce mom-to-bus legislation to protect maternal health. And she speaks now very clearly about her past prosecutorial life and all the things for which people would need access to broad sexual and reproductive health care. So she’s just an authentic advocate. She comes to it in a very real, personal way. And I feel like there is a, I don’t know, a radical realignment that’s happening that’s running right through reproductive freedom. And having her at the head of the ticket in this moment has just put a lot of energy and a lot of boost into the election, but also into this issue again. Claire McCaskill: In the contrast, we’re talking about the light. Now we’re going to talk about the dark, which I got to tell you, this is a brief story. When I was a young state representative, we were debating an abortion legislation. As you know, Missouri has been home to a number of challenges over the years, and some have made their way to the Supreme Court. And some of us were arguing for a rape and incest exception to laws that were going to clearly pass in Missouri. And one of my colleagues, a black state rep from St. Louis, got up on the floor, and I’ll never forget the speech he gave because he looked around the room and he said, you know, all of you are sanctimonious and you want to vote to deny women their rights. And that’s because the sun is shining. But I see you all at night. Oh, the night when you are with women you shouldn’t be with and when you are really worried about whether or not they get pregnant. I mean, he went there and all of the women, there were only like maybe 12 of us in the room, you know, we all our jaws just dropped and went, you go guy, you go guy. The night, oh, the night. So we’ve talked about the bright daylight, which is represented by Kamala Harris on this issue. But the night, the darkness is represented by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. And I know that Jessica Valenti does a Substack newsletter called Abortion Every Day. She’s done a deep dive on Project 2025. Let’s talk about what this document, which has been birthed by Trump associates for the purpose of informing what they want to do. It’s called 2025 for a reason. It’s not called 2032. It’s not called 2022. It’s called 2025. Talk about what’s in that document and how frightening it is to everybody who has sex in America. Alexis McGill Johnson: Project 2025, Trump’s Project 2025, as much as he wants to distance himself from it, is one of the most frightening things that I have read. And I have looked at all 990 pages of it because the audacity of putting out a playbook, right, putting out a playbook where they felt so confident to put into print they want a national abortion ban, that they want to criminalize mifepristone, medication abortion, that they want to reverse the FDA’s approval of Mifepristone, that they want to change the name of the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of Life, right, so that they can continue to drive draconian, more draconian measures from the national level. And to do it in ways, Claire, that are really, in many ways, through executive order, right, enforcing things like the Comstock Act, so that they don’t even have to engage with the Senate, right. They don’t have to engage with the House. They can actually just do these things through executive power. And, you know, when you have a former president who is perfectly fine saying, you’ll never have to vote again after four years if you just get me in, or I’ll only be dictator for one day, and the confidence with which they have put forth this playbook, it’s clear that the intent is to have a national abortion ban, to use the full power of the executive office to do that, and to ensure that he can get away with anything. Now that he has immunity, he can continue to get away with anything. That, I think, is the most frightening thing. And I think that’s also what is animating voters right now. Claire McCaskill: And I wish everyone, I wish we could make Project 2025 mandatory reading for everyone. I have taken the time to wade through as much of it as I could stomach. I was fascinated, as somebody who was a former prosecutor myself, and who, for a long time, I was the only woman in the office in Kansas City, and so therefore, I got assigned all the sexual assault cases. So I’ve handled literally hundreds of rape cases. And this idea that they’re going to rename the morning after pill to the week after pill, and the idea that they’re going to redefine emergency contraception as an abortifacient, as opposed to a preventative thing that a woman who’s been raped would get, at her option, obviously. It’s not mandatory, but it is offered that when she is reporting a rape and is undergoing a medical examination for a rape kit, the harassment this document would allow for women in trauma is just off the charts. What do you think, and do they actually think America is going to accept this kind of going back to the past? Talk about dark alleys. Alexis McGill Johnson: I mean, yeah, the enforcement of these laws would require women to have to report on their rapists. The level of surveillance, right? I mean, you know, J.D. Vance talking about, like, how are we going to understand that they are stopping people from crossing state lines? You know, like the amount of surveillance, right? And the amount of invasion of privacy that has to accompany these horrific bans and restrictions, I think, is also something that we haven’t played out fully for people. And I think that’s like a big question, right, for me. How do you enforce these laws? How do you enforce some of the craziest restrictions? And then what will it mean, right, for patients who need to get access, but also the providers, right? I think that there’s something really important to understand about what is happening to the provider community right now. There has been a 10% decline of OBGYN residents matching into banned states. And so what that means is now these restrictions that will come even further with Project 2025 are decimating not just abortion care, but also broad maternal health care, particularly providers who have to provide or are trained to provide in high-risk maternal care, right? So for many of us who have later-in-life pregnancies, needing advanced maternal care is critical. So you don’t trust women so much that you’re willing to actually devastate and decimate an entire profession. And our ability to make decisions of if, when, and how we decide to build a family, it’s so counterintuitive. Or, I mean, it’s just so weird. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, we’ve gotten to the point because of Dobbs that OBGYNs feel like they have to have a direct line to lawyers. Alexis McGill Johnson: That’s right. Claire McCaskill: And that’s just weird. It is just not good that a doctor has to somehow check themselves before giving the care that they think their patient needs. It violates everything about the standards of care in medicine. And, you know, the point you make about enforcement, I think it’s really important to emphasize this. The Democratic senators realized that in some of these states, what could occur is a blanket subpoenaing of women’s health records. In our state, we caught the Department of Health trying to track women’s periods. We actually caught them doing that. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes, yeah. Claire McCaskill: And so they put a bill forward to limit the ability of law enforcement, police, to be able to subpoena women’s private medical records. Now, obviously, if it was something where there was a basis for it because a crime had been committed, but just to investigate potential violations of abortion restrictions, they wanted to limit the ability of police to do that. Now, think about this. Twenty-eight United States senators voted against that bill. This was just a few months ago. Twenty-eight of them. That’s a fourth of the representation in the United States Senate voted that, no, we’ve got to give police the ability to go poking around in women’s private medical records. And guess who was one of the senators who voted with the 28? That would be none other than J.D. Vance, who also voted against protecting contraception, who also voted against protecting IVF. So there you have it, the trifecta. And they want the cops in your medical records finding out when you had a period, see if they can catch you. They want to make sure you can’t have IVF so that you can have children that you and your family desperately want. And at the end of the day, they want to make sure that you can’t prevent a pregnancy from happening in the first place, which would avoid the need for any abortion. So it is crazy what these folks are trying to do to our country. Alexis McGill Johnson: It’s crazy and it’s creepy. I remember when the state health commissioner in Missouri was tracking, I think, Planned Parenthood patient periods. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Alexis McGill Johnson: In an Excel file. What kind of creep wants to be tracking women’s cycles to understand what they’re doing with their reproduction? The invasion of it and the fact that that mentality is so embedded in, as you said, a fourth of our Congress. That is just insane. Claire McCaskill: Yup. Alexis McGill Johnson: That’s just insane. Claire McCaskill: Well, I want to thank, first of all, I want to thank you. And I want to thank the thousands of men and women who work with and for Planned Parenthood. I confronted a young state senator in my state who was a woman who was railing against Planned Parenthood. And I looked at her in a kind of quasi-public setting. I said, you know, Sarah, I’m just curious, where did you get the pill when you were in college? And there was a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (ph) because that was certainly my first encounter with Planned Parenthood, was access to the pill at a point in my life where it was very important that I wanted to make sure I didn’t get pregnant. So I just don’t think we thank you guys enough. There are thousands of volunteers. There’s thousands of people that are working across this country to make sure that there are still safe places where women can get all the health care that they richly deserve. We want to wish you the very best and tell all the troops that we’re proud of the work they’re doing and to continue the fight because we’ve got a lot to fight for. Alexis McGill Johnson: We are on it, and we really appreciate you for being such an incredible reproductive freedom champion. You’ve always been and continue to carry the message here and we appreciate you. Claire McCaskill: You bet. Alexis McGill Johnson is the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She’s been part of Planned Parenthood’s leadership for more than a decade.

Disappointing jobs report sends unmistakable signal to the Fed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 6:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/disappointing-jobs-report-sends-unmistakable-signal-fed-rcna164840,"Expectations heading into this morning showed projections of about 185,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in July. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market didn’t fare quite that well. CNBC reported: The jump in the unemployment rate was especially notable: In July 2023, the rate was 3.5%, and 12 months later, it’s 4.3%. It’s why the public is about to hear a lot about the “Sahm Rule.” But as the public digests the latest figures, it’s worth emphasizing that the Federal Reserve, hoping to combat inflation, kept interest rates high, knowing it would cool the job market. The recent slowdown, in other words, isn’t an accident; it’s a deliberate outcome of the Fed’s strategy. It’s also why the obvious reaction to today’s jobs report will be renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve for a meaningful rate cut in September — at the latest. As for the politics, let’s circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump’s presidency — when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet — the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018 and 2019. According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16.2 million jobs since January 2021 — more than double the combined total of Trump’s first three years. For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions: 2013: 2.3 million 2014: 3 million 2015: 2.7 million 2016: 2.3 million 2017: 2.1 million 2018: 2.3 million 2019: 1.98 million 2020: -9.3 million 2021: 7.2 million 2022: 4.5 million 2023: 3 million Seven months into 2024: 1.4 million This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Why Trump isn’t celebrating as Americans return home from Russia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 5:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-isnt-celebrating-americans-return-home-russia-rcna164827,"As President Joe Biden’s term enters its homestretch, it stands to reason that the Democratic incumbent might be thinking about his legacy and his accomplishments. If so, it’s quite likely that Biden realizes that Thursday’s developments, and his role in making them happen, won’t soon be forgotten. NBC News reported: Biden described the diplomatic efforts that led to the release of the four U.S. detainees a “feat of diplomacy and friendship,” which was more than fair given the circumstances. Indeed, given the available details, the story reads like a dramatic film involving international intrigue, secret talks, complex diplomacy, and reunited families. But as the credits rolled, and audiences cheered, Donald Trump sat on his hands. It would’ve been easy for the Republican nominee to celebrate the return of Americans who’d been unjustly detained by Russia, but the former president instead published a biting missive to his social media platform, posing a series of barbed questions that made his annoyance clear. After asking whether the Biden administration was giving Russia “cash” — the White House had already answered that question, explaining that Russia would not get money from the agreement — Trump complained that officials from his own country “never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps.” In case that weren’t quite enough, the GOP candidate went on to write, “Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING. ... “They’re calling the trade ‘complex’ — That’s so nobody can figure out how bad it is!” For now, let’s put aside the fact that when Trump claimed he gave up “nothing” to get Americans back, he was brazenly lying. Instead, let’s focus on why the former president’s first instinct was to whine about good news for his own country. Trump can’t claim credit: Sure, some Republican partisans, including his running mate, peddled silly claims about the former president playing some indirect role in the developments, but Trump seemed to realize that he had nothing to do with this. And if Trump can’t plausibly claim credit for good news, then the news, practically by definition, can’t be good. Trump said this wouldn’t happen: The Republican spent months publicly arguing that he, and he alone, would have the wherewithal to bring Gershkovich home. Oops. Trump almost certainly couldn’t have pulled this off: The lynchpin of the deal was diplomatic work with Germany. When Trump was in office, he tapped a notorious online pest to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Germany, where he managed to routinely infuriate our allies in Berlin. In fact, Trumps ambassador was so reviled that some German officials spoke publicly about the possibility of asking him to leave the country. The agreement was the result of alliances that Biden strengthened and Trump intends to weaken: As Biden explained on Thursday, he and his team “rebuilt NATO. We rebuilt the circumstances to allow this to happen. That’s why it happened.” These are the same alliances, of course, that Trump has been hostile toward for years. No wonder the GOP nominee isn’t happy."
The Harris honeymoon ends soon. She'd better be ready for what's next.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-energized-democrats-party-faces-maga-republicans-rcna164603,"Democrats have had a remarkable two weeks, as Vice President Kamala Harris has re-energized their hopes for retaining the White House and definitively turning the page on the Trump era. But it’s only been two weeks. Even in the most abbreviated general election campaign in modern history, the likely Democratic nominee will face three full months of negative advertising, blunders and bad luck, just like any other candidate. As the honeymoon phase comes to a close, the newly cemented Harris campaign needs to lay the groundwork for what’s next, take advantage of its tremendous grassroots support across the country, and prepare a counteroffensive to the coming attacks. Last week on MSNBC, veteran Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats to “get ready. They’re coming after us.” He added, “This kind of giddy elation is not gonna be very helpful much longer.” Carville’s comments weren’t directed at voters, but instead at the Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee. As the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, I view his warning as a message to those in power within the Democratic Party to get to work. Over the next three months, Democrats at all levels need to harness the enthusiasm for Harris into action. The Trump campaign was caught off guard by the quick consolidation of support for the vice president, but Democrats need to prepare for a full-throated attack. MAGA Republicans won’t go down without a fight. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s combative interview at the National Association of Black Journalists conference — in which he went after her race and gender directly — followed by his social media posts and a speech by vice presidential nominee JD Vance criticizing her as “chameleon-like” flip-flopper have shown that the gloves are already coming off. Trump’s Republican Party sees this election as a last chance at holding power. Look no further than Project 2025. Trump-aligned conservatives at the Heritage Foundation didn’t spend years on an agenda to overhaul our nation’s institutions for nothing. The MAGA movement will work tooth and nail to win this election so they can implement a far-right authoritarian takeover. Don’t let the head fake of the Trump campaign “distancing” itself from Project 2025 fool you. These are the stakes of the 2024 presidential election, and the Harris campaign should know what it’s up against. Trump and his allies will resort to vicious attacks in an attempt to define Harris. Some of those lines of attack will land in the minds of some voters. As the boxer Mike Tyson famously said, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. A good team of advisers and strong messaging should help them navigate those moments. The shift to Harris may stymie Trump and his campaign, but they’re already pouring millions of dollars into TV ads in battleground states. This new advertising blitz is part of Trump’s effort to define Harris as a failed “border czar” (a title she did not have, though that will not deter them). Immigration is a major vulnerability for Democrats and the Harris campaign, but they can undercut this weakness with the right messaging. Harris wasted no time reframing the issue on her terms this week in Atlanta. She spent the first part of her stump speech highlighting her tenure as California attorney general. Harris touted her record of prosecuting transnational gang members and human traffickers who came to the U.S. illegally. She also reminded voters that Trump pressured Senate Republicans to block a bipartisan deal to secure the border. Harris told the crowd, “Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.” The Harris campaign knows it can’t sit around and let Trump control the narrative. That’s why Harris wasted no time building a narrative of her own. She’s a former prosecutor and Trump is a criminal. This early stage of any campaign is a battle of definitions, and the contrast is stark. While energy and excitement are great for raising money and gathering volunteers, if you haven’t prepared to be smacked upside the head by an asymmetrical political actor, all that money and energy won’t be enough to break through that wall on Election Day. Democrats should seize on this moment of enthusiasm, but they can’t get caught up in the moment. The goal now should be manifesting this bolt of energy into a three-month game plan to win at the ballot box. From now until Nov. 5, every day matters. The Harris campaign needs to make the most of every minute. As a former party chairman, I know every moment counts.

What it takes to free an American detained abroad,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 4:45 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/russia-prisoner-swap-evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-rcna164749,"The patriotic, perhaps most human, reaction to Thursday’s release of multiple Americans held hostage in Russia — including journalist Evan Gershkovich and security contractor Paul Whelan — is to welcome them home with open arms and take a moment to appreciate that the U.S. government is willing to go to bat for its people when they travel abroad. Unfortunately, that simple axiom hides a tricky calculus of how countries often effectively kidnap people under false pretenses to gain an advantage in the game of geopolitical chess. Countries like China, Iran, North Korea and Russia often use a tactic once reserved for militants and revolutionary groups: scooping people up and using them as political bargaining chips. When hostages were taken by Al Qaeda in Pakistan or the FARC in Peru, the U.S. government was also able to work with and pressure local governments to bring Americans home safely.  As Thursday’s prisoner swap indicates, things have shifted in more recent years — rogue governments themselves see an advantage in violating diplomatic norms of goodwill to visitors.  Regimes like Russia’s will grant visas to Americans and then levy charges to turn them into prisoners, with the expectation they will gain concessions for their release. Journalists, like Gershkovich, who are shedding light on the realities of life in those countries, are brought up on charges of espionage. Athletes like Brittney Griner, who played basketball professionally in Russia for more than a decade, was detained on drug trafficking charges and sentenced well beyond the usual time for marijuana possession.  According to the James Foley Foundation, this wrongful detention trend reached a height in 2022; currently more than 40 Americans are still wrongly detained for an average of five years, the majority of them in China and Russia. As legal prisoners of a foreign government, these Americans can’t be rescued by a stealth SEAL team; they must go through a court process and country-to-country negotiations for even the possibility of a prisoner exchange. To further complicate matters, many held in these foreign legal systems are dual nationals who are also subject to the laws of both countries. Until the court case is resolved, U.S. lawyers and diplomats can’t intervene without being accused of violating the authority and sovereignty of the host country. Even getting the U.S. secretary of state to make a formal declaration of wrongful detention is a secretive process, something families of detained people have decried for years. The unfortunate truth is the American system doesn’t have a good answer for what to do about bad actors’ being incentivized to use people as political pawns. But the U.S. government can at least do right by the families of people held in unjust foreign captivity by being more transparent and declassifying information about their loved ones’ captivity. More broadly, in moments when our adversaries try to use our people and values against us, the U.S. government shouldn’t hesitate to double down on what makes us distinct from these autocratic regimes — standing up for individual rights and protecting our people abroad."
Why Kamala Harris’ biracial identity upsets Donald Trump so much,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 4:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-interview-kamala-harris-black-indian-nabj-rcna164736,"Early in Donald Trump’s meltdown at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists convention, the former president offered unsolicited commentary on the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. “She was Indian all the way,” Trump said of his presumptive opponent, “and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person. Somebody should look into that.” There is a multitude of problems with Trump’s comments, from his presumption that he has the expertise and jurisdiction to judge someone else’s identity to his argument that Harris lacks the racial bona fides to merit the Black audience members’ allegiance. But the former president’s ramble offers another important conclusion: Trump simply doesn’t understand race. When Trump asks for somebody to “look into that,” the truth is that for years researchers have looked into that. What they’ve found is that overly simplified perspectives on race like Trump’s are not only misplaced, but they are counterproductive and dangerous. Scholars of race have long argued, and demonstrated, that race is a socially constructed category that still has very real outcomes. We, as members of society, constantly construct, deconstruct and reconstruct what race means. Even the basics of how race is measured in America have evolved over time. The 1850 U.S. census was the first to acknowledge people of multiracial descent, with the category “Mulatto” used as a way to exclude them from having full political rights. Not until the 2000 census were multiracial Americans able to formally mark more than one racial identity. In fact, the multiracial population is the fastest growing racial group in the United States, with a 276% increase between 2010 and 2020. As ABC News’ Rachel Scott pointed out to Trump, Harris “has always identified as a Black woman. She went to a historically Black college.” (Harris graduated from Howard University, where she was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically African American sorority.) But in Trump’s worldview, you’re either Indian or you’re Black. You cannot be both. This is ironic considering his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, is the father of three biracial (Indian and white) children. Trump doubled down on this sentiment after the NABJ interview: At his rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that same day, his campaign displayed a graphic quoting Harris as having referred to herself as the “first Indian-American senator.” Which, of course, she was. And which, of course, does nothing to disprove her Blackness, because she is both. Trump fails to grasp what census takers recognized more than two decades ago and what Walt Whitman wrote two centuries ago: We contain multitudes. Harris is Indian. Harris is Black. This isn’t a contradiction. Trump’s recent comments mark but one in a series of episodes showing he shares a misunderstanding all too common even in today’s increasingly diverse and multiracial society: the (hyper) essentializing of race and other social categories. Researchers describe essentialism as seeing particular qualities as being intrinsic or inherent to a particular group of people. These beliefs (e.g., all women are bad at math) start to form in early childhood and can further solidify as one ages depending on one’s further socialization. Trump’s false confidence in the essentialized either/or nature of identity leads him to believe that once he knows what you are, he’ll also know how you’ll think and act. It opens the door to thinking that Jewish voters who opt for his opponent are “bad Jews,” his frequent claims about the monolithic notion of “Black jobs,” and referring to anyone who criticizes Israel — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer — as “a Palestinian,” even if Schumer was born in Brooklyn. Acknowledging the existence of multiracial identities completely scrambles this perspective and upsets the stereotypes that Trump holds close to his heart. People can claim more than one identity without being disingenuous. Our identities are not limited to those labels others apply to us. Individuals who share aspects of their identities — whether race, gender, religion or otherwise — cannot be expected to all think, act or vote in the same way. It is likely too late for Trump to accept and fully grasp that millions of Americans are multiracial. But we hope that his racist comments will prompt other Americans to think more flexibly about identity."

The massive deal, cut among seven nations, involves 24 people, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens held in Russia, and eight Russians imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Slovenia, Norway and Poland.” * In the Middle East: “Mourners in Iran and Lebanon commemorated slain militant leaders Thursday, as they vowed retribution against common enemy Israel and signaled that the most recent paroxysm of violence gripping the Middle East may be far from over.” * Trump’s latest legal setback: “A New York appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump’s bid to dismiss the partial gag order against him in his criminal case. Trump had argued the gag order was unnecessary and should be dismissed after his conviction in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 campaign. A five-judge panel of the state Appellate Division, a mid-level appeals court, disagreed.” * An important plea deal: “The man accused of plotting the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and two of his accomplices have agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and murder charges in exchange for a life sentence rather than a death-penalty trial at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, prosecutors said Wednesday.” * A story worth watching: “Moldova’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday it has expelled a Russian diplomat after two Moldovan officials were detained on suspicion of treason and conspiracy against the European Union candidate country.” * In Utah: “The Utah Supreme Court upheld on Thursday a suspension of the state’s near-total ban on abortion, meaning the procedure remains legal while a court challenge to the law proceeds.” * Right-wing social media posts claimed a suspected murder in the United Kingdom was an undocumented immigrant. The claims were false, but riots happened anyway: “Seeking to quell a surge of misinformation-fueled unrest, a British judge on Thursday took the unusual step of naming the 17-year-old suspect in a stabbing rampage that left three children dead and eight injured in northwestern England early this week.” See you tomorrow."
Donald Trump has always been ‘weird.’ Here's why it won’t work against Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-weird-kamala-harris-rcna164753,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Way Too Early."" Let’s talk about Donald Trump’s week.  Things started to kick off on Tuesday with Trump policing who is and isn’t a good Jew. The former president called a conservative radio show to escalate his attacks on Jewish Democrats, calling them “fools” and saying they “should have their heads examined.” Then on Wednesday, Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania where he mistakenly referred to Republican Senate candidate David McCormick as the state’s “next governor.” Twice.  Earlier that same day, Trump made an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference and took aim at his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris — accusing Harris, who's biracial, of “turning Black.” So in 24 hours, Trump went from deciding who’s a good Jew to who’s really Black or who’s really Asian.  This is a guy who is clearly struggling to find his footing against Harris. So what does he do? He goes back to his original playbook, one that dates back even further than 2016. He’s trying to play the greatest hits of birtherism all over again. Ever since the Republican Party’s convention it seems Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have leaned into the weirdness. It’s almost like Trump is saying, “Boy, you know that Vance is really weird. Hold my beer, because look what I’m going to do here.” But Trump’s appearances aren’t a one-off. What we witnessed this week is pure Donald Trump. This is who he is. This is what he looks like when he’s in a somewhat hostile environment and asked tough questions. He has a meltdown. This is a moment in American politics where you step back and realize that you have the Republican candidate for president playing the race card and engaging in some of the worst kinds of racial stereotyping. It's a repulsive moment in American politics, but it’s also a reminder of what Trump is doing and all he represents."
"Trump is right about ‘two systems of justice,’ but for the wrong reasons",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-two-systems-of-justice-jan-6-pardon-rcna164658,"Donald Trump complained about “two systems of justice” when asked at a National Association of Black Journalists panel discussion about his support for Jan. 6 defendants. But to the extent that those criminal defendants (including Trump) have been treated differently, they’ve fared better than the average defendant on multiple fronts. Take their Supreme Court success, for example. As we know, the court recently bestowed broad criminal immunity on former presidents, which happens to help the GOP presidential nominee in his own criminal cases. In another appeal this past term, the court narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. The justices didn’t have to intervene in either dispute — indeed, they reject most appeals — much less rule how they did. On top of help from the justices, journalist Radley Balko observed that Jan. 6 defendants have been largely at liberty before trial, with the courts being “far more likely to release Capitol rioters pre-trial than other defendants.” There’s also the special treatment that Trump has vowed to apply on the back end of the criminal process if he returns to the White House. He said Wednesday that he would “absolutely” pardon Jan. 6 defendants “if they’re innocent.” Likewise, if he wins in November, Trump may also attempt a legally untested self-pardon, though he may more likely have his newly installed attorney general dismiss his two federal cases; presidents can’t pardon people for state charges. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases and was found guilty in the one case that has gone to trial so far, in New York.) That’s saying nothing of any revenge he would seek to exact if he regains power, something that would solidify a two-tiered justice system — but not how he meant.

Trump makes callous joke while honoring the man killed at his Butler rally,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-corey-comperatore-widow-rcna164738,"Near the start of his speech at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Donald Trump spoke about Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the shooting at the former president’s campaign rally last month. Trump held a moment of silence for Comperatore, whom he called ""a hero to all of us."" Yet even as he honored the late firefighter, Trump appeared to make an off-the-cuff quip while talking about his widow’s grief. The GOP presidential nominee told the crowd that a friend of his had given Comperatore's family a $1 million check, and he also made reference to money donated to the family's GoFundMe. ""But you know what? Corey's wife said, 'I'd rather have my husband,'” Trump said. “Isn’t that good? I know a lot of wives that would not say that — I’m sorry,"" he continued, as the crowd laughed. ""They would not say that."" Trump's unfiltered manner of speaking has long been a quality reviled by his critics and beloved by his supporters. His crude attempts at levity and flippant comments in somber situations — especially while he was in office — have contributed to a longstanding perception that he's callous and unempathetic. Comperatore, 50, was killed while trying to protect his wife and two young daughters when a 20-year-old gunman opened fire at Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Two other men, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were critically wounded but have since been released from the hospital. Comperatore's family said that Trump reached out to them days after the shooting. His widow, Helen Comperatore, has said that President Joe Biden also called her family that weekend, but she declined to speak with him out of respect for her husband, who she said was a ""devout Republican."" “I support Trump. That’s who I’m voting for, but I don’t have ill will towards Biden,” she told the New York Post at the time."
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran. What happens next?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hamas-biden-haniyeh-assassination-rcna164747,"Although Israel has not claimed formal responsibility, it’s widely believed that it launched the operation that killed the leader of Hamas’s political wing, Ismail Haniyeh. The fact that Haniyeh was targeted wasn’t a surprise; he had been on Israel’s radar for decades and was almost killed by an Israeli strike in 2003. The surprise was that Israel reportedly targeted Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after he attended the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. In the hours since, there has been much speculation about the wider consequence of Haniyeh’s slaying. Many observers foresee a war that expands beyond Gaza, which Israel has been attacking since Oct. 7 with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after it launched an audacious attack inside Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to more than 250 being taken hostage (to date, more than 39,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there). The Biden administration is likely planning for the worst, with some U.S. officials expressing concern that Israel’s assassination of Haniyeh could undermine ongoing cease-fire talks and cause the region’s other flashpoints — the Israel-Lebanon border region, for one — to explode. For Iran, the killing of Haniyeh is, at the very least, a big embarrassment and demonstrated yet again the Iranian security services’ ineptness at securing high-profile people. Haniyeh was a frequent traveler to Tehran, meeting with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei four times since November. But on this particular occasion he was a formal dignitary at Pezeshkian’s inauguration ceremony and an official guest of the Islamic Republic. The fact that, according to The New York Times, the Israelis were able, undetected, to kill Haniyeh by planting a bomb in a room of a guesthouse that he was known to stay at — and that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had the responsibility of securing — means that the slip-ups exposed years ago when a top Iranian nuclear scientist was killed in another Israeli operation remain unresolved. So, what next? Khamenei warned Israel that it will pay a “heavy price” for killing Haniyeh and reportedly ordered a retaliatory attack against Israel. If that happens, it wouldn’t be the first time Iran has tried to strike Israel directly; in April, approximately 300 drones and missiles were launched toward Israel following an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria, which killed a top Iranian military officer. Even then, the Iranians gave advance notice of the operation in an evident attempt to mitigate the blowback. That incident showed that, Iran’s penchant for revolutionary rhetoric aside, its top leaders have shown themselves to be cautious and risk-averse during crises. It’s easy to see why: Iran has nothing to gain, and indeed has much to lose, from getting into an armed confrontation with Israel that could spiral into a war. Any Iranian retaliation therefore is likely to be limited, not indiscriminate. What about Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia? Like Iran, Hezbollah would rather avoid a full-fledged war with Israel if it can. To the casual observer, this will sound strange. After all, Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets and missiles into northern Israel since October, killing 25 people (most of them soldiers), displaced 60,000 Israelis from the area and on July 27 killed 12 children in an unjustifiable, gruesome attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Yet the vast majority of Hezbollah’s attacks have occurred in a relatively depopulated area 5 or 6 miles south of the Israel-Lebanon border. The missile fire endangers the civilians who still live there but is far less than what Hezbollah is capable of. Hezbollah has attempted to accomplish two things simultaneously: support Hamas in Gaza but avoid any military moves that could push Israel into launching a full-blown war in Lebanon. Understandably, U.S. officials remain worried, particularly after Israel killed Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander and top adviser to the group’s overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Tuesday. Hezbollah can’t be seen as complacent after receiving such a blow to its top echelons. The prospect of deeper Hezbollah strikes inside Israel and even more intense Israeli reprisals inside Lebanon aren’t inevitable but have certainly increased. If that happens, Iran would be pulled into the fray; Tehran is Hezbollah’s longtime patron and will at the least provide it additional weaponry. As for Hamas, it is struggling to survive Israel’s massive assault on Gaza and is in no position to respond to Haniyeh’s killing, save perhaps with some rocket attacks that Israel has the means to combat. Yet it’s safe to assume that Hamas will halt the cease-fire talks with Israel, at least temporarily, which John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, has already acknowledged as a possibility. Though the United States blames Hamas for the logjam, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has never been keen on a permanent cease-fire and won’t be sorry to see the talks stalled. Will Haniyeh’s death seriously damage Hamas? Unlikely. There will be no shortage of fighters ready to join Hamas’ ranks. Israel has killed several of Hamas’ senior leaders in the past, including the movement’s founder and spiritual guide, the quadriplegic Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in March 2004, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantisi the following month and Saleh al-Arouri in a drone strike in January. In November 2012, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed Ahmed al-Jabari, the de facto commander of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz-al Din al-Qassem Brigades. And were it not for a last-minute intervention by Jordan’s King Hussein in 1997, Khaled Mashaal, Hamas’ former leader, would have been on that list: Israel poisoned Mashaal in Amman, Jordan, but was forced to hand over the antidote after significant pressure from Jordan’s then-king Hussein. Hamas has survived these assassinations because it has an institutional structure that has been built up over years (the movement was founded in 1987) and solidified its influence in Gaza during its 17-year rule over the territory. Haniyeh will soon be replaced, the war in Gaza will continue, and Hamas will endure. Most headlines written after Haniyeh’s killing warn of a wider war in the Middle East, but all of the parties involved in this latest flareup also have reason to be careful."
Prime Minister Netanyahu: Make good on your promise and bring our son home,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/edan-alexander-hamas-hostage-message-netanyahu-rcna164588,"Three hundred days ago today, Hamas terrorists set fire to Israel. They burned homes, raped women, murdered more than 1,000 innocent people and took hundreds more captive. Amid the death and destruction, our son — 20-year-old Edan Alexander, an American from Tenafly, N.J. — was taken hostage. We have not heard a word from him since.   Edan is one of 120 hostages — eight of whom are American — still trapped in the darkness of Hamas captivity. It is a world governed by torture, starvation and the constant fear of death. Despite this gruesome reality, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put his personal political fortunes ahead of the release of innocent lives for nearly 10 months. In his appeal to the U.S. Congress last Wednesday, he hardly mentioned the hostages (American and Israeli) he has left behind.  In a private meeting in the White House Cabinet room last Thursday, the families of American hostages sat beside the prime minister and President Joe Biden, and we did not mince words. We demanded answers from the prime minister: We told him that enough is enough, and in response, he committed to a three-phase proposal to release the remaining hostages. He said that it would only be a matter of days before we saw action. There would be no new requirements for Hamas, no new setbacks, and soon, the ball would again be in Hamas’ court.   He not only made this promise to us, he did it in front of an audience that included Biden and national security advisor Jake Sullivan — two people we know are in our corner and who we trust to hold Netanyahu accountable. We left the meeting hopeful, but during this agonizing process of negotiations, we’ve learned to keep our optimism in check.  What now, Mr. Prime Minister? You vowed to make the hostages your priority and to waste no time in bringing them home. A week has come and gone since our meeting, and Edan is still in hell. Instead of expediting a deal, you have added new demands that you promised to avoid. So, when exactly are you going to close this deal? You came to our country — to request our government’s support — and you are still standing in the way of our son’s release. We’re grateful that you met with us. We’re even more grateful that you committed to the total and swift release of the hostages. But words are nothing until Edan is in our arms. Edan does not have the luxury of time. Israeli authorities have pronounced a third of the remaining hostages dead, with the two most recent deaths announced just last week. We cannot delay the end of the war in Gaza any longer. In Israel, Netanyahu’s own defense and intelligence officials have said so. In the U.S., both presidential candidates have called for an end to the war, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have shared their support for a hostage deal.  The world is watching where Netanyahu goes from here. He made a spectacle of coming to America. He now has Washington’s attention and the attention of more than 20 other countries that count hostages in Gaza as their own. It is time Israel’s leader shows us new solutions. We are done with the political theater, Mr. Prime Minister. We need a statesman negotiating our son’s release, not a showman. We implore you to make good on what you promised us last week, put forth a hostage deal that Hamas will accept, and devote all of your energy towards seeing it through.  "
Senate GOP derails compromise bill that included child tax credit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senate-gop-derails-compromise-bill-included-child-tax-credit-rcna164752,"Traditionally, when Democrats and Republicans come together and forge a bipartisan compromise on a key issue, the legislative wheels on Capitol Hill start turning in a constructive way. There are, however, exceptions. NBC News reported: The vote was largely, but not entirely, along party lines: Three Senate Republicans — Missouri’s Josh Hawley, Florida’s Rick Scott, and Oklahoma’s Markwayne Mullin — voted for the measure, while two independents who caucus with Democrats — Vermont’s Bernie Sanders and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin — voted with the GOP minority. Even if Sanders and Manchin had sided with the majority, it wouldn’t have mattered: This was a procedural vote that required a 60-vote majority. (The final tally was initially 49-43, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer switched his vote for procedural reasons.) In case anyone needs a refresher, as the year got underway, Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced a breakthrough on tax policy. It appeared at the time as if both sides were prepared to get something important. For Republicans, the compromise deal included an extension of Trump-era tax breaks for businesses. For Democrats, the bill included an expansion of the child tax credit that the party has championed in recent years. In a written statement, Wyden explained after the bipartisan agreement came together: “Fifteen million kids from low-income families will be better off as a result of this plan, and given today’s miserable political climate, it’s a big deal to have this opportunity to pass pro-family policy that helps so many kids get ahead.” As we’ve discussed, this isn’t as ambitious or as generous as the original Democratic policy from 2021, but it was a plan that was poised to help millions of families. It was against this backdrop that the House voted with uncharacteristic speed, passing the deal on tax policy just a couple of weeks after it came together. The final vote in the lower chamber was 357-70 — a lopsided margin in a House that tends to be evenly divided along partisan and ideological lines. The legislation’s prospects were bright, right up until they weren’t. Senate Republicans raised a variety of objections. Some questioned the bill’s impact on the deficit; some wanted more work requirements (which already exist in the CTC policy); and others said they prefer to incorporate the relevant provisions into a larger debate next year when Trump-era tax breaks are set to expire. What’s more, some of the more candid GOP senators admitted that they simply didn’t want to give the Democratic White House an election-year victory. Whatever the Republicans’ motivations, the end result was the same. “This should be a no-brainer,” Schumer told reporters Thursday. Evidently, 43 of the New York Democrat’s colleagues disagreed. As for electoral considerations, Sen. JD Vance has spoken quite a bit lately about families and his belief that policymakers should do more to reward parents. But when it came time to vote on this extension of the child tax credit, the Ohio Republican and GOP vice presidential nominee didn’t show up for the vote and did nothing to encourage his Senate colleagues to support the bipartisan compromise. “Today, Senate Republicans voted to block a $700 average tax cut for working families with children and the construction of 200,000 homes with affordable rents—even though this bill passed the House with strong bipartisan support and comes at no cost to the federal deficit,"" White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement. ""That is a vote against giving families with children a tax cut, against reducing child poverty, against lowering rents, against fiscal responsibility, and against bipartisanship. The President and the Vice President will continue to fight for an expanded Child Tax Credit and to expand the supply of homes with affordable rents at a time when the cost of living is too high for so many Americans.”  This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Simone Biles wins gold in the Olympics all-around final,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/simone-biles-wins-olympic-gold-medal-gymnastics-all-around-rcna164688,"Simone Biles sprung to the top of the podium in the women’s gymnastics individual all-around final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday, winning a gold medal and further cementing her place in sporting history. Biles is the first American to nab two Olympic all-around titles and just the third woman ever to do so — the feat was last achieved by Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Biles’ first individual all-around gold came in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. Biles finished with 59.131 points after coming back from a mistake on the bars to ace the beam and floor routines. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil took silver with 57.932 points, and American teammate Sunisa Lee captured the bronze with 56.465 points. Biles and Lee were already gold medalists in Paris, with Team USA having won the women’s team final Tuesday. That win also gave Biles her eighth Olympic gold medal, making her the most decorated U.S. gymnast of all time. Andrade had won the world championships in 2022, followed by Biles taking gold in 2023. The 25-year-old Brazilian gymnast was widely seen as the only competitor who could potentially best Biles in Paris. At 27, Biles is the oldest Olympic gymnast to win the all-around gold since the Soviet Union’s Maria Gorokhovskaya won in 1952 at age 30."
Neil Gorsuch features in Supreme Court bid against vague drug law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 10:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/gorsuch-analogue-act-drug-supreme-court-rcna164652,"A new Supreme Court appeal spotlights one of the strangest criminal sagas prosecuted under one of the most peculiar drug laws, known as the Analogue Act. The federal law bans selling substances that are “substantially similar” to ones that have already been deemed illegal. But the vague and unscientific nature of the term “substantially similar” has led to confusion in courts. Multiple federal judges have questioned its legality, and even chemists within the Drug Enforcement Administration have disagreed about its meaning. Notably, the justice most interested in the appeal could be Donald Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch. He wrote critically of the 1986 act when he was on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. So it’s unsurprising that Charles Burton Ritchie and Benjamin Galecki name-check Gorsuch repeatedly in their petition filed Thursday, including a 10th Circuit decision in which he called the law “a curious animal,” deeming it “an open question, after all, what exactly it means for chemicals to have a ‘substantially similar’ chemical structure — or effect” and “whether terms like those will admit of fair application and afford citizens fair notice.” The Analogue Act passed in 1986 as an attempt to combat so-called designer drugs that enter the underground market faster than the government can ban them. Usually, breaking a drug law is straightforward — say, by selling cocaine or heroin, which everyone knows are illegal. By contrast, the Reagan-era act captures anything that federal prosecutors can convince a jury is “substantially similar” to an already scheduled drug. That gives the authorities a wide net, one whose ambiguous shape raises the question of whether it’s too wide for the Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee notice of what’s illegal. Ritchie and Galecki’s case gives Gorsuch the chance to weigh in from Washington, where it takes four justices to grant review. It’s unclear whether the court will do so, partly because the justices only take a relative handful of cases each term despite receiving thousands of petitions — this past term they heard about 60. But the court previously scrutinized the act in the 2015 case McFadden v. United States, before Gorsuch joined the court. In that decision, the justices unanimously put a greater burden on the government to prove analogue cases, but they left the law and its “substantially similar” standard intact. Citing remaining confusion after the McFadden ruling, Ritchie and Galecki told the high court in their petition on Thursday that there’s more work yet to do: The backstory of Ritchie and Galecki’s case is a long, strange one (I wrote a book about it, called “Bizarro,” which the petition cites). But they had a company based in Pensacola, Florida, that distributed synthetic products commonly called “spice,” seen as a cannabis alternative that some people have used to beat drug tests that would flag for the natural plant. The main ingredient in spice that gets people high is synthetic cannabinoids, which aren’t necessarily illegal; it depends on the specific chemical and there are many variations. It’s a cat-and-mouse game, with spice sellers like Ritchie and Galecki using chemicals that weren’t scheduled and shifting to new compounds as older ones were banned. One of their spice products was called “Bizarro,” named after Superman’s twisted doppelganger who was hatched in a “bizarre science experiment gone horribly wrong.” They had a Nevada warehouse that was raided in a 2012 nationwide enforcement effort called Operation Log Jam. Ritchie then made a move that a typical drug dealer wouldn’t have: He invited the DEA to their Florida headquarters. He gave an agent a tour of their operation and samples of their spice, which he knew didn’t contain scheduled chemicals because they lab-tested their products before shipping them to shops around the country. Still, Ritchie offered to shut down the business, but the agent said it looked like they were trying to comply with the law and that he couldn’t interfere with their right to commerce. Nonetheless, they were charged under the Analogue Act in 2015, years after they had left the business and embarked on careers in film and entertainment. Remarkably, they were indicted in three separate federal districts and taken to trial three times to date. Their first trial, in Virginia (one of the states they distributed to), ended with a hung jury in 2016, because jurors couldn’t reach a verdict under the Analogue Act’s vague test. The 2017 retrial almost ended the same way, but the second jury eventually found them guilty, after prodding from U.S. District Judge Raymond Jackson to decide one way or the other. He sentenced them to about three decades in prison apiece. But their convictions were overturned on appeal because the judge had wrongly blocked DEA chemist Arthur Berrier from testifying for the defense. Berrier thought the substances they sold weren’t analogues — that is, he thought they weren’t substantially similar to scheduled drugs. Obviously, that would have been damning testimony from a government expert. At the 2019 trial in Nevada leading to this Supreme Court appeal, the judge there let Berrier testify. But in another twist, the expert chemist was by then a convicted felon himself, following his arrest in a sting operation when he allegedly tried to meet an underage girl who was actually an undercover officer. So while he gave his expert testimony that contradicted the prosecution’s stance, the jury heard he was a felon who no longer worked for the DEA, clouding his testimony that could have otherwise demolished the government’s case. Ritchie and Galecki were convicted under the Analogue Act as well as a federal kingpin law that carried a 20-year minimum and life maximum. At their sentencing, U.S. District Judge Andrew Gordon stuck to the 20-year minimum and called out the Analogue Act in the process. He was troubled that while a typical dealer “clearly knows he or she is selling an illegal substance,” someone accused of selling alleged analogues “may not know he or she is breaking the law until the jury decides it is in fact an analogue.” Gordon granted Galecki, 50, compassionate release last year for health issues he faced while incarcerated and reduced his sentence to time served; the judge also granted Ritchie’s release pending appeal, meaning the 53-year-old returns to prison if they lose. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Ritchie and Galecki’s analogue and kingpin claims last year, prompting the high court bid. On top of the analogue argument — that the act is “void for vagueness” in their case — they said in their petition that their kingpin convictions are invalid because one of their alleged underlings was acquitted at the Nevada trial; they cited disagreement among the federal circuits over whether a conviction can stand in that situation. Such a “circuit split” makes the justices more likely to grant review, providing an additional (or alternative) reason for the court to take the case. The Justice Department can respond with its own brief before the court considers whether to do so.

Donald Trump loses latest gag order challenge in New York,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 9:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-gag-order-appeal-loses-new-york-rcna164697,"Donald Trump lost his latest bid to crush his New York gag order, with a state appeals court keeping the limits in place ahead of the former president’s sentencing on 34 counts of falsifying business records. After Trump’s trial ended with guilty verdicts on all counts in May, Judge Juan Merchan partially terminated the order as it pertained to trial witnesses and the jury, but kept its restrictions on speech targeting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s staff, court staff, their family members as well as family members of Bragg and Merchan. In a ruling on Thursday, the state appeals court rejected Trump’s argument that the trial’s conclusion was a change in circumstances warranting terminating the order completely prior to sentencing. “The fair administration of justice necessarily includes sentencing,” the appeals court wrote, citing the limited nature of the remaining order and noting that “threats received by District Attorney staff after the jury verdict continued to pose a significant and imminent threat.” The GOP presidential nominee is set to be sentenced Sept. 18, assuming Merchan rejects the former president’s immunity motion in a ruling due Sept. 6.

"The day after taking aim at Harris on race, Trump doubles down",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 9:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/day-taking-aim-harris-race-trump-doubles-election-2024-racism-rcna164716,"The opening salvo came unexpectedly in an unlikely setting. Donald Trump, appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention, thought it’d be a good idea to go after Vice President Kamala Harris on race. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the Republican presidential nominee said of his likely opponent on the Democratic side. “I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the former president added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded: “Is she Indian, or is she Black?” The backlash was immediate — and widespread. Even some Republicans described the GOP nominee’s racism as “embarrassing” and “awful.” An Axios report described Trump’s offensive as “a nightmare” for his party. But let’s not lose sight of the fact that Trump’s new line of attack wasn’t limited to the stage in Chicago. After the event, he used his social media platform to push a follow-up salvo. “Crazy Kamala is saying she’s Indian, not Black,” he wrote alongside a video of Harris referencing her Indian heritage. “This is a big deal.” Soon after, ahead of a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump’s political operation promoted images on a giant screen featuring headlines noting Harris’ Indian-American identity. On Thursday morning, as NBC News noted, the Republican nominee pushed the line of attack again. This, evidently, is Trump’s idea of a gotcha. So, why in the world is he doing this? I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s weird perspective, but the answer isn’t immediately obvious. It’s possible that Trump thinks he can convince Black voters that Harris isn’t Black enough. Or maybe Trump thinks it’s up to him, and not Harris, to decide how she should describe her own race and ethnicity. It’s also possible that Trump, whose lengthy record of overt racism is well documented, is genuinely confused about the very idea of someone being biracial. If Harris has celebrated her mother’s background, as far as the Republican sees it, it necessarily means she rejected her father’s background. Or maybe Trump’s brand of racism is based in part on the idea that those in communities of color get special breaks and benefits, making him uncomfortable with the idea of an opponent being able to check more than one box. Whatever the explanation, it seems like a safe bet that voters haven’t heard the last of this line of attack, even if many GOP officials would prefer to hear Trump say anything else. UPDATE (August 1, 2024, 2:26 p.m. ET): Shortly after I published this piece, Trump used his social media platform to amplify a related online item from right-wing media personality Laura Loomer, who claimed that Harris’ birth certificate ""proves"" that she's not Black."
Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion are on Kamala Harris' side — that's bad news for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 9:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-harris-beyonce-megan-thee-stallion-2024-rcna164566,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 30 episode of “The Beat.” Newly released audio of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has revealed what the vice presidential candidate really thinks about the 2024 Democratic ticket shake-up. Vance privately told donors Vice President Kamala Harris’ entrance into the race was “a little bit of a political sucker punch”: “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.” To say Harris isn’t struggling is an understatement. She is thriving. While no one knows who will win in November, Republicans can clearly see Harris’ appeal. That kind of appeal is the reason the party pushed hard at the Republican National Convention to feature anything that might feel somewhat cool or current — from Hulk Hogan to rap videos to Instagram star Amber Rose. Republicans know culture matters to voters.  But now the party now has the oldest nominee ever. While Donald Trump did have a run on television and a presence online before he entered politics, “The Apprentice” debuted 20 years ago. It’s a relic of a reality TV past. Harris, on the other hand, taps into the now and the future. That much is evident from the soundtrack of her first campaign video, which features a song from a superstar currently on music charts: Beyoncé. In the song “Freedom,” Beyoncé recounts fighting uphill battles, both personal and political: “Freedom! Where are you? ’Cause I need freedom, too! I break chains all by myself.” And while the Harris campaign’s song choice does have political appeal, this isn’t just posturing from a candidate. The vice president is a genuine, longtime Beyoncé fan, even attending a show last year in the tour’s official sparkle theme attire.  As a senator, she shouted out Beyoncé's documentary, “Homecoming,” for how it “celebrates” historically Black colleges. The feeling seems mutual. In 2020, on the eve of the election, Beyoncé posted a photo on Instagram wearing a Biden-Harris mask — broadcasting her approval of the ticket to over 300 million followers. Pop culture is a language young people speak fluently. That demographic was crucial to the winning Biden-Harris coalition in 2020. In 2024, the vice president needs their support again.  Most voters oppose fake posturing from politicians, and Harris comes across in this cultural moment honestly. She did even so before there were signs she would top the ticket.  Harris has used her platform as vice president to elevate artists and art forms Washington has long ignored. Last year, she hosted a celebration at her official residence to mark hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. The event featured artists like Lil Wayne and Jeezy.  The celebration became something of a national Rorschach test: Do you see energy, optimism and inclusion? Or do you see something else? It’s clear the Republicans want you to see something else. On Tuesday, Trump released his first attack ad on Harris, featuring video of her dancing from that 2023 hip-hop celebration — an attempt to portray the vice president as somehow less serious of a politician. But as Republicans continue their attacks on Harris, trying to see what sticks, another star has thrown her support behind the vice president: Beyoncé's fellow Houstonian Megan Thee Stallion. The rap star is no stranger to political statements. In 2021, she dropped her own anthem about women’s rights. The music video shows a Republican senator, in a MAGA-red tie, going online to hypocritically attack her in misogynistic terms. In the video, Megan confronts him for disrespecting the women who keep things running. On Tuesday, Megan Thee Stallion joined Harris for a rally in Georgia, where the star urged her fans — dubbed “Hotties” — to stand behind the vice president. A “Hot Girl Summer” for Harris, indeed. From Beyoncé to Megan Thee Stallion to Charli XCX, the vice president’s set list of support keeps growing longer and longer by the day. Can the Republican Party and Donald Trump muster anything to match it?

"Reporter Evan Gershkovich, veteran Paul Whelan released in Russia prisoner swap",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 8:25 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 1, 2024, 9:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-russia-prisoner-swap-rcna164653,"Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan are among the Americans released Thursday in a prisoner swap between the United States, Russia and other countries. Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmashev, U.S. permanent resident Vladimir Kara-Murza and 12 German nationals held in Russia have also been released in exchange for eight Russian nationals who were being held in the U.S., Slovenia, Germany, Norway and Poland. Central to the deal was the release of Russian FSB Col. Vadim Krasikov, who had been serving a life sentence in Germany for the murder of a Chechen dissident in Berlin in 2019, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on a call with reporters. ""It became clear that the Russians would not agree to the release of these individuals"" if Krasikov was not included in the exchange, Sullivan said, thanking the German government. In a statement Thursday, President Joe Biden called the deal “a feat of diplomacy” and vowed to reunite “every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world” with their families. “I am grateful to our allies who stood with us throughout tough, complex negotiations to achieve this outcome — including Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey,” he added. “This is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world whom you can trust and depend upon.” A senior administration official said Biden had spoken to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in February about the swap. The official said Scholz told Biden, ""For you, I will do this."" Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 while he was on assignment in Moscow. He was found guilty of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security prison last month. Both the U.S. government and Gershkovich's employer, The Wall Street Journal, called his trial a ""sham."" Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, celebrated Gershkovich's release in a statement: ""While we waited for this momentous day, we were determined to be as loud as we could be on Evan’s behalf. We are so grateful for all the voices that were raised when his was silent. We can finally say, in unison, 'Welcome home, Evan.'"" Whelan, 54, had been serving a 16-year sentence in a Russian penal colony after being convicted of espionage in 2020. He was arrested in December 2018 while in Russia for a friend's wedding. Both men and the U.S. government have vehemently denied allegations of espionage. Negotiations in prisoner swaps between the U.S. and Russia have often been colored by political tensions. Sources told NBC News earlier this year that a deal to release Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, as well as Whelan and Gershkovich, had been in the works before Navalny died in a penal colony in February. At the time, Biden blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for Navalny's death. In 2022, while criticizing the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, former President Donald Trump said he had turned down a deal to secure Whelan's release in exchange for Bout. Whelan's family has said that Trump did little to move negotiations forward when he was president. Trump has also repeatedly claimed that he would free Gershkovich from Russian detention if he wins the November election, boasting that Putin would ""do that for me, but not for anyone else."" His remarks were widely criticized, including for potentially scuttling the possibility of Gershkovich's release prior to the U.S. election."
Ex-Nevada politician found guilty of murdering journalist,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 12:24 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 29, 2024, 5:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-telles-murder-trial-verdict-jeff-german-las-vegas-rcna168400,"UPDATE (Aug. 29, 2024, 8:05 a.m. ET): Former Nevada politician Robert Telles was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday after he was found guilty of murdering local reporter Jeff German. Telles, 47, is eligible for parole after at least 20 years in prison. A Nevada jury has found Robert Telles, a former local politician, guilty of murdering an investigative journalist who was reporting on alleged mismanagement of Telles' office months before he was killed. Jurors convicted Telles of murder with use of deadly weapon on Wednesday, two days after deliberations began. As the verdict was read in court, Telles' gaze was lowered and he shook his head. The trial will move into the penalty phase later on Wednesday, when jurors may hear additional testimony to determine Telles' sentence. He faces up to life in prison. The verdict wraps a weekslong trial over Telles' role in the gruesome killing of veteran Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German in September 2022. A former Democratic administrator of a Clark County office that handles unclaimed estates, Telles had been at the center of German's investigation into allegations of bullying and hostility. German also reported on the then-politician's alleged romantic relationship with a female employee. Telles denied the allegations at the time. He subsequently lost his re-election bid in the Democratic primary, and he later singled out German for criticism on social media. Days after German was found dead with stab wounds in his home in September, Telles was arrested on suspicion of murder. During the trial, jurors heard emotional testimony from German's neighbors, as well as Telles' allegations on the stand of a bizarre conspiracy against him. Telles maintained his innocence throughout, claiming that his office co-workers, a real estate company, prosecutors and Las Vegas police were trying to “frame” him for fighting corruption. “I’m not crazy. I’m not trying to avoid responsibility,” Telles testified. “I didn’t kill Mr. German, and I’m innocent.” Prosecutors disputed those claims during the trial, telling the jury that they simply “didn’t make sense.” German’s own attorney, Robert Draskovich, did not side with him, though he said in closing arguments that his client’s belief in a conspiracy against him was “understandable.” “What other options does he have under these circumstances?” Draskovich asked."
'Super genius' economists say Trump budget is costlier than Harris plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-penn-wharton-economy-harris-rcna168687,"For what feels like the umpteenth time, experts are highlighting major aspects of Donald Trump’s economic policy that could hurt the economy and spike deficits. Two new reports from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model — part of the school Trump has attended and described as “super genius stuff” — found the GOP presidential nominee's economic proposals would increase the deficit nearly five times more than Vice President Kamala Harris' plans.  As CNBC explained: In contrast, here’s how CNBC summarized the Harris report: CNBC added the caveat that much of the revenue Harris hopes to generate with her economic plan requires congressional approval. But even with that caveat, the predictions are stark: Trump’s economic proposals would be all but certain to raise deficits dramatically — as he did when he was president — relative to Harris’ plans, which could cost about a fifth as much as his, according to the reports. Polls suggest most Americans feel the candidate most equipped to handle the economy isn’t always the candidate with the most salient economic plan. Trump’s plan has been panned several times now, despite his apparent polling strength on the issue.  The Penn reports follow a joint letter from 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists in June, who warned that Trump’s economic plan — particularly, his plan to deport immigrants en masse and impose 10% tariffs on all imports — would fuel inflation. And Moody’s Analytics came out with a report in June that reached a similar conclusion.  It's no wonder Trump and his campaign have worked so hard to undermine their movement’s faith in economic experts."
RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard have joined Trump's campaign. It could backfire.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-trump-gabbard-transition-harris-rcna168592,"Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard joined former President Donald Trump’s transition team this week. Trump’s campaign has framed the addition of Kennedy and Gabbard, who are both former Democrats, to its team as proof that Trump has assembled a “broad coalition” that has expanded “across partisan lines.” Kennedy and Gabbard don’t represent significant Democratic constituencies, however. They’re fringe, idiosyncratic political players who’ve long had supporters on the right. Trump's tent didn't necessarily get bigger; in fact, this is a potential narrowing of his coalition, as there’s a chance that, by bringing Gabbard and Kennedy under his wing, Trump alienates more voters than he wins over. It is standard — and savvy — for parties to point out that they appeal to people across the aisle. At the Democratic National Convention, Democrats attempted to make that case by inviting several Republicans to speak on the main stage, such as former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. Having people like Kinzinger speak about how they’ll be voting for Democrats and not Trump’s GOP is powerful because Kinzinger is still a Republican and during his time in office he was aligned with the Republican establishment. He was first elected during the tea party wave — endorsed by Republican former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — and as my colleague Steve Benen has pointed out, Kinzinger’s voting record in Congress was that of a traditional Republican partisan. His strident opposition to Trump, then, has the potential for credibility with certain sectors of the GOP. Kennedy and Gabbard, a former representative from Hawaii, aren’t analogous to Republicans like Kinzinger. Even when Gabbard was in the Democratic Party, her outlier positions on foreign policy made it an awkward fit. In office, Gabbard praised Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Syria strategy over former President Barack Obama’s, met personally with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and argued in favor of aligning with his brutal regime and insisted Democrats weren’t calling out Islamist terrorism clearly enough. She fared poorly in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, where her value add as a candidate was her idiosyncratic foreign policy views. In 2022, she announced she was leaving the party, and she immediately formed a warm relationship with Fox News. She has evolved into a vociferous critic of Democrats and long been seen as a friend of the MAGA right. Thus, her joining Trump doesn’t come as a shock.  Kennedy’s journey is different, but it similarly clashes with the Democratic Party establishment. Despite his surname and a history of working as an environmental lawyer, he has long been at odds with prevailing norms among Democrats, liberals and even mainstream conservatives with his noncredible activism against vaccines. During the Covid pandemic, he became a superspreader of misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and influenced Republican talking points with his online messaging. When he threw his hat in the ring in the Democratic presidential primaries in April 2023, he did, surprisingly, garner the interest of a surprisingly large percentage of Democrats, sometimes receiving the support of up to 20% of Democratic voters. But before it could be established what percentage of that support owed to Biden fatigue and his name’s being Kennedy, he dropped out of the primaries and launched an independent campaign. Most of his time as a presidential candidate in the public eye has been defined by his appearances in the right-wing media ecosystem. It’s no surprise that, since last year, polling has shown that Republicans hold a more favorable view of him than Democrats do. In other words, neither Kennedy nor Gabbard is well-positioned to sell the story of how the Democratic Party left them. While both of them are idiosyncratic and hold views that don’t fit into one ideological category, their most salient, reputation-defining views in recent years haven’t had a significant audience in the Democratic Party. For a long time they’ve been seen as not quite belonging to that party. Their defections to Trump not only make sense but have recently even seemed probable. Will Trump benefit from his newest transition team members? Gabbard has a small, energetic online following, but she’s currently more of a pundit than a politician and has been seen as an adversary of the Democratic establishment long enough that it’s hard to see her moving the dial in any significant way. Kennedy, on the other hand, was putting up significant numbers with his independent presidential campaign until last week, and the behavior of his following remains an open question. After Vice President Kamala Harris entered the White House race, Kennedy’s support declined to around 5% in three-way matchups among Harris, Trump and Kennedy. It seemed clear he was more of a threat to Trump’s vote share than Harris’. But it’s hard to predict how persuasive Kennedy will be in persuading his supporters to cast their ballots for Trump. It is plausible that a significant proportion of his remaining die-hard followers were disinclined to ever vote for either of the two major parties. It’s also plausible that much of his support was never going to materialize at the ballot box since his campaign hinged on the idea of mistrust of American institutions. Instead of winning more independents, there’s even a chance Trump takes a ding among such voters for Kennedy’s most extreme views and for lending credence to the Democrats’ seemingly effective attack that the GOP is hobbled by weirdness and creepiness. Kennedy constantly makes news for an unrelenting stream of outlandish conspiracy theories and bizarre personal tales. He has offensively and falsely claimed that Covid was ""targeted"" to spare Chinese people and Jews. He has told stories about worms eating his brain and about leaving a dead bear cub in Central Park. It has recently resurfaced that in a 2012 magazine story, his daughter said her father once found a dead whale on a beach in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, used a chain saw to sever its head and then tied it to the roof of his car and (potentially illegally) drove it home to New York. In light of Kennedy’s official role in helping form a potential Trump administration, and in light of reporting that Kennedy and Trump have discussed whether he’d have a position in one, Democrats can now pin Kennedy’s strangeness and extremism onto Trump. Trump might ultimately benefit at the margins from Kennedy’s dropping out and joining his campaign. All signs indicate that this will be an extremely tight race, and so even a small share of votes that might’ve otherwise gone to Kennedy in a swing state could be of help to Trump. But it’s far from a slam dunk. (One additional wrinkle: Kennedy won’t be able to remove his name from ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan, and that fact could theoretically hurt Trump in those states with people looking for a protest vote option.) Ultimately, Gabbard and Kennedy aren’t sirens for Democrats, and Kennedy’s extremely odd behavior could be a liability for Trump."
"Trump, while reflecting on assassination attempt, puts blame on Biden and Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-dr-phil-interview-assassination-attempt-biden-harris-rcna168617,"Donald Trump said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are at fault “to a certain extent” for the attempt on his life last month in Pennsylvania, blaming them for security deficiencies even though the president and vice president have no involvement in Secret Service assignments. “He always made it very tough for us to have the proper number of Secret Service people,” Trump said about Biden in an interview with TV personality Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil. “When this happened, people would ask, whose fault is it? I think to a certain extent it’s Biden’s fault and Harris’ fault,” Trump added in the interview, which aired Tuesday. “And I’m the opponent. Look, they were weaponizing government against me, they brought in the whole DOJ to try and get me, they weren’t too interested in my health and safety.” Trump’s claim is entirely unfounded. The president and vice president are not involved in Secret Service assignments. The agency, which is funded by Congress, has faced a staffing shortage for years, as NBC News recently reported. A Secret Service official told NBC News that the shortfall has resulted in denials of requests for extra personnel for Trump over the past two years, but added that no such requests had been turned down for the rally where he was shot. On Wednesday, FBI officials told reporters that Trump’s would-be assassin had searched online for information about both of the major parties’ national conventions and that the former president’s July 13 rally in Pennsylvania appears to have been a “target of opportunity.” Trump’s comments escalate the tension in an already heated election year. Republicans have blamed the shooting on Democrats for calling Trump a threat to democracy after he has repeatedly vowed to tear through political norms and governmental systems of checks and balances. Analysts and experts have said that the surge of violent threats against election officials is in part motivated by Trump’s own vengeful rhetoric toward those he perceives as enemies. In the interview, Trump spoke at length about the rally shooting. McGraw also appeared to egg him on, asking: “I’m not saying that they [Biden and Harris] wanted you to get shot, but do you think it was OK with them if you did?” “I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know,” Trump responded. “There’s a lot of hatred. I don’t know why. I had a great presidency.” At one point, the former president suggested that he may have survived the shooting because God wants him to save the world. “If I win that [the election], that would really serve to say that there’s some incredible power up there that wanted me to be involved — and maybe it’s more than saving the nation, maybe it’s saving the world,” Trump said."
Trump is borrowing an old GOP tactic on abortion — with one key difference,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-reproductive-rights-truth-social-abortion-rcna168309,"On Friday, Donald Trump declared that his administration would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” The Truth Social post immediately drew the ire of anti-abortion leaders and the mockery of commentators supportive of abortion rights, who noted that in an interview the day before, Trump had also repeated his now familiar (and false) line that all Americans wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. Trump is trying to have it both ways. And while this strategy may not exactly be working at the moment, history can help us understand his bigger goal — and whether it will work in the longer term. Clearly, Trump and many in the GOP are aware that the reversal of Roe remains unpopular. And Republicans’ attempts to appear more moderate may seem novel, given how recently politicians like JD Vance boasted about their pro-life bona fides. But in reality, just a few decades ago mainstream Republicans were already trying hard to appease both sides of the debate. Ronald Reagan was the first GOP presidential nominee to fully embrace the anti-abortion movement, believing not that most Americans opposed legal abortion but that his position could help the GOP win over socially conservative Catholics and Democrats who might have voted Democratic for economic reasons. In 1976, the GOP platform adopted at the Republican National Convention had taken a muddy position on abortion; in 1980, Reagan ran on a platform that embraced an amendment to the Constitution to protect fetal rights. But by the late 1980s and early 1990s, GOP leaders were having second thoughts. Lee Atwater, George H.W. Bush’s campaign manager, often stated publicly that anti-abortion positions were unpopular and stressed that the GOP was a “big tent” that could accommodate those with a range of positions on reproductive rights. With Atwater’s encouragement, Ann Stone, the ex-wife of Trumpworld insider Roger Stone, launched Republicans for Choice in 1990 to organize these efforts. This move was blunted by the success of firebrand Pat Buchanan during the 1992 GOP primary, however. Buchanan fared better than expected in several key contests, winning himself a prime slot at the GOP national convention, where he railed against abortion and women working outside the home. Republicans had considered changing their platform at the 1992 Republican National Convention to leave out demands for a fetal personhood amendment. But Bush ultimately veered back to the right on the issue. The whiplash continued. After autopsies of the race established that the abortion issue had hurt George H.W. Bush, the effort to make the GOP a “big tent” regained momentum. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader and GOP standard bearer in 1996, wanted to push a more moderate line. He called on his party to condemn a specific procedure performed in the second trimester that abortion opponents called “partial-birth abortion.” At the same time, Dole promoted a pledge of tolerance welcoming those into the GOP with a wide variety of views on personhood, especially those who considered themselves pro-choice. But Dole lost that November to President Bill Clinton, and abortion opponents argued that his position on abortion had watered down the enthusiasm of his own base. President George W. Bush won two elections at a time when abortion rights seemed secure. His father, by contrast, lost an election at precisely the time many Americans had first expected Roe to be overturned. By that point, Reagan and the elder Bush — both of whom had called for the reversal of Roe — had nominated a majority of the justices then on the Supreme Court. And more tellingly, in 1989, the Supreme Court had issued a major decision openly criticizing Roe. This election season, Trump has borrowed from strategies that the GOP once used to undercut Democrats’ advantage on abortion. Like his predecessors, Trump and other Republicans have spotlighted abortions later in pregnancy, presuming them to be more unpopular. The 2024 GOP platform omitted any mention of a fetal-personhood constitutional amendment and praised IVF. And as mentioned earlier, Trump himself has used the language of “reproductive rights,” suggesting that he, too, wants to build a big tent. But look closer, and it is clear that Trump is doing something different. Advocates like Atwater or Stone might generally have supported some abortion rights — or felt the need to change the GOP’s position to remain electorally relevant. (Welcoming pro-abortion voters into the tent, in theory, would necessitate a political pivot.) With Trump, it’s far less clear that this is the case. After all, Trump never defined what he meant by “reproductive rights,” and has claimed baselessly that Americans never wanted a right to abortion in the first place. This despite polls dating back to before Roe’s reversal show that more than half of Americans did not want it to be reversed. It certainly seems possible that Trump’s definition of reproductive rights could actually exclude the right to an abortion. This confusion is par for the course with Trump. His platform, for example, nodded to the theory that the Fourteenth Amendment already recognized fetal personhood, and members of the platform committee insisted that it was for this reason that there was no longer a need to mention a specific personhood amendment. Trump has said that he supports the Supreme Court’s recent ruling preserving access to the abortion pill mifepristone yet also suggested that he was open to prohibiting mifepristone access. And recently, when stating that he would not enforce the Comstock Act, a nineteenth-century obscenity law some conservatives would love used to ban abortion, Trump made clear that the specifics had yet to be worked out, and that his commitment not to enforce the law, such as it was, applied only “generally.” The upshot, it seems, is that Trump wants both anti-abortion voters and supporters of abortion rights to vote for him without offering either one much of anything. Trump’s obfuscation has angered anti-abortion leaders with reason — it suggests that he has taken their voters for granted. And Trump has embraced talk of reproductive rights while reiterating how happy he is that the Supreme Court overturned the biggest safeguard to those rights. Trump is not the first Republican to try to walk a fine line on abortion. But he may be the first GOP presidential candidate to try to totally redefine the concept of reproductive rights in a bid to soften his rhetoric without having to actually soften any of his policy stances."

While litigation continues over the unusual matter, a federal judge has given Shkreli, who left prison in 2022, until Friday to “sequester and turn over all of his copies, in any form, of the Album or its contents to defense counsel” and to file an affidavit swearing under penalty of perjury that he has done so and that he no longer possesses any copies, in any form, of the album or its contents. U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen’s preliminary injunction order on Monday further requires his counsel to file a letter by Friday certifying that they’ve taken possession of the album copies and contents. The judge also ordered Shkreli to file, by Sept. 30, an inventory and account in the form of an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that includes: the nature and volume of the copies of the album’s data and files that he retained; the names and contact information of anyone to whom he distributed the data and files; when and how he distributed them; and the amounts, source, date and nature of any financial benefits he received from his distribution or playing of the album or its contents. After hearing legal arguments from the parties, Chen, sitting in the Eastern District of New York, said that a preliminary injunction was in the public interest and that the plaintiff had raised sufficiently serious questions about Shkreli’s possible violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, misappropriation of trade secrets and unjust enrichment. Shrekli’s lawyers had argued that the plaintiff couldn’t show sufficient harm to warrant an injunction.

Colorado man arrested after allegedly making threats against judges and election officials,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 2:26 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/colorado-man-death-threats-judges-election-officials-rcna168666,"On Monday, federal authorities announced the arrest of a Colorado man for allegedly lobbing death threats at election officials, judges and federal agents, largely using social media platforms known as hotbeds for right-wing extremism. The arrest of 45-year-old Teak Brockbank is the latest in a disturbing trend of violent threats targeting election officials and other people framed as enemies by the vindictive MAGA ecosystem. A DOJ press release summarizes the claims: An affidavit shows authorities’ concerns stemmed from statements Brockbank allegedly made via text messages and posts on two Trump-friendly social media sites: Gab and the JD Vance-backed video platform Rumble. The names of the officials targeted in the posts were sealed at the request of the government. Brockbank's threats allegedly began in 2021, when Trump and his failed presidential campaign directed the movement’s vitriol toward the U.S. election system. In one comment on Rumble in 2021, Brockbank allegedly called a Colorado judge a “communist,” claiming he’d be “justified” if he were to “put a bullet in this Mans head and send him to explain himself to our Creator right now.” That comment also made reference to “where we go one, we go all,” a phrase propagated by Trump-loving QAnon conspiracy theorists. In July 2021, the same Rumble account posted that ""there is no other way to fix this mess in Colorado and Arizona without executing these evil people,"" going on to refer to election officials. In a Gab post from September 2021, Brockbank allegedly said that an election official “needs to- No has to Hang she has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.” That same account repeated calls for hangings in “Communist Colorado,” claiming “we will have to do it ourselves!” And in August 2022, the Rumble account responded to a user who urged “taking” the country back with more death threats directed at another official. “Once those people start getting put to death then the rest will melt like snowflakes and turn on each other and we will just sit back,” the account said, adding that “those of us that have the stomach for what has to be done should prepare our minds for what we all ARE going to do!!!!!!” The affidavit also refers to a text message Brockbank allegedly sent his stepfather in 2023: “Four judges in Colorado have removed President Trump from the ballot in Colorado” and “their names have been moved to the front of my list.”  The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately overruled the Colorado state Supreme Court's ruling that Trump was ineligible to appear on the state's ballot, but not before the ruling resulted in a wave of violent right-wing threats that caught the eye of federal law enforcement.  What else should we expect from a conservative movement that continues to lionize those who engage in political violence?"
Project 2025 would enable Donald Trump's worst instincts as commander in chief,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 2:18 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/donald-trump-veterans-military-project-2025-rcna168665,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 27 episode of ""The ReidOut."" Now that Donald Trump is trying to get elected again, he’s pretending to care about America’s military service members and veterans — or at least trying to get you to forget all the ways he’s denigrated them.  This weekend marked six years since Vietnam War hero Sen. John McCain died. It also marks six years since Trump had to be shamed into releasing a formal statement on the senator’s passing. Trump’s pettiness in the wake of McCain’s death is just one example of his pattern of disrespect for America’s military. He has reportedly called fallen soldiers “losers and suckers” and told aides he didn’t want to see disabled veterans at events. He recently said the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest presidential civilian award, is better since recipients of the Medal of Honor, the highest military award, are either dead or have combat wounds. He’s also denigrated the generals who’ve served under him, suggesting the execution of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and calling his former White House chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly “stupid.” Now, another general who served under Trump, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster,  is giving his inside account of the former president's chaos. In a new book, McMaster writes about how Russian dictator Vladimir Putin manipulated Trump by playing to his “ego and insecurities with flattery.” McMaster also says Trump set the stage for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 by entering into negotiations with the Taliban. Trump's threats to our country's military aren't just in the past. If he wins a second term, Trump has expansive and draconian plans for the military. He’s already plotting to fire top military leaders who don’t share his vision — an idea straight out of Project 2025: Firing top officers is one of many ways Project 2025 seeks to rebuild a military it refers to as “Barack Obama’s general officer corps.” In addition to calling for firing and freezing promotions for generals, Project 2025 also wants to rebuild and retrain the military. It would require all public schools to administer the military entrance exam for recruitment. The document also calls for the reinstatement of active-duty members who refused Covid vaccines and restoring their rank. Project 2025 pushes for abolishing diversity, equity and inclusion offices and staff — ostensibly to make the military whiter and reduce women’s roles. It also calls to expand support for the Department of Homeland Security’s border protection operations. In plain English, that means deputizing the military to round up migrants.  It’s clear Project 2025 would enable Trump’s worst instincts when it comes to his role as commander in chief. The prospect of handing the reins of our military back over to him should terrify us all.

Kennedy Jr. will not be able to remove his name from the ballots in Wisconsin and in Michigan, two crucial battleground states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hoping will deliver them a decisive win in November. Kennedy suspended his independent bid for president last week and promptly endorsed Trump. Polls had shown that Kennedy was more likely to gain support among Republicans than among Democrats, and the suspension of his presidential campaign was seen as more beneficial to Trump than to Harris. In remarks to his supporters on Friday, Kennedy said he was not formally ending his campaign and that he intends to remain on the ballot in states where he poses little to no threat of splitting the vote with the GOP nominee. But in Michigan and Wisconsin, where polls have been running close, Kennedy has now been barred from removing himself from ballots. In Michigan, where Kennedy was nominated as the Natural Law Party's candidate, a spokesperson for the secretary of state's office told NBC News that minor-party candidates cannot withdraw their nominations. The Wisconsin Election Commission on Tuesday also declined Kennedy's request to take his name off the ballot; Ann Jacobs, who chairs the commission, said that state law does not permit a qualified candidate who has filed nomination papers to decline nomination, NBC News reported. Still, Kennedy's insistence on remaining on ballots in non-swing states may speak to a need to prove that his candidacy, no matter how little it is resonating, has appeal. Days after Kennedy suspended his campaign, Kentucky's secretary of state said he had filed on Monday to run for president in the state and will appear on the ballot in November."

Harris paired the suit with a cream crepe de chine lavallière blouse, also by Chloé, and high-shine pointed-toe pumps.

The internet was quick to draw parallels between the two outfits. Many X users posited that Harris was deliberately evoking Obama’s tan suit, subtly trolling Republican pundits. Responses to a post made by MSNBC’s “The Weekend” Executive Producer Kyle Griffin included “troll game strong” and “I yelled and then had to explain to my kid why the tan suit was an expert level choice for her.” While the Harris-Walz campaign is quick to embrace all Obama-era commentary and has proven its internet fluency, this fashion moment was Harris’ alone. Harris’ campaign outfits are a sign of a new era of political dressing. Her campaign wardrobe, from the now iconic Chloé suit to her brightly colored tailored separates with pared down Chucks, is not representative of the bygone 2010s “Lean In” girlboss dressing or 1980s suiting as a means to battle in-office sexism. No, Harris’ outfits exist wholly in the context of today. The year 1992, dubbed “the year of the woman” for electing four women to the Senate, led to a significant moment for women’s suiting. The following year, then-Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski became the first woman to wear a pantsuit on the Senate floor when she and then-Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum launched a subdued but effective protest: They wore pants and told female staffers to do the same. In the years after, the pantsuit became the accepted and almost compulsory apparel for women in Washington, including for Hillary Clinton. Donning pants instead of skirts is historically revolutionary. Selecting clothing that exists outside of what is attractive to a patriarchal society is a weapon that women have used to protect themselves for generations, as a means to demand respect and safety. A contemporary, more grim, version of this can be seen in a viral TikTok trend showing young women covering their fashionable miniskirts with baggy t-shirts on the New York subway. Being a woman on public transportation, on Capitol Hill, in court rooms, on Wall Street and in newsrooms has until very recently been viewed a detriment. And while clothing, of course, neither protects you nor precludes you from sexual harassment or assault, the way you dress is a vehicle for respect, power and self-confidence. In the aftermath of #MeToo, standing on the shoulders of women trailblazers, traditionally male silhouettes are no longer required. Today, two things exist at once: womanhood and power. Harris’ Chloé suit set the tone for the rest of DNC and for the rest of her campaign. In wearing her  suits and not, say, a more conventional navy, knee-length skirt, Harris is signaling that she is unafraid to carve her own path forward. (As the first Black and Indian American woman on the ticket, this is impossible anyway.) In this way, this suit — a modern spin on traditionally accepted political women’s wear — mirrors her candidacy. Harris is demanding respect in her own way. Perhaps the most radical and revolutionary of all: Harris looks pretty. She looks presidential. Suits, although awash on the DNC stage, have little practical space in a contemporary woman’s wardrobe, except as subversive. It is chic and popular, in perpetuity, to wear a deconstructed suit to a formal event à la Bianca Jagger’s seminal Yves Saint Laurent wedding outfit. With more employees working from home, very few workplaces require the sort of formality that Washington still does. The suit has mostly been replaced with so-called power dressing: shoulder pads, oversized blazers, slouchy boyfriend-without-the-boyfriend jeans. Clothing that skews more gender neutral is not just trendy, but it is also mainstream. Once again, Harris has proved incredibly adroit at reading and tapping into the zeitgeist. Chloé and boho chic are experiencing a resurgence. A few weeks ago, Sydney Sweeney wore head-to-toe Chloé in black thigh-high leather boots, a cream-colored mini dress and capelet. Daisy Edgar-Jones spent much of her ""Twisters"" press tour in Chloé, including a stunning sky blue, sheer ruffled maxi dress. And Harris, having publicly worn the French brand at least three times, is now listed in their ranks. In 2008, one of the campaign slogans Obama ran on was “change we can believe.” Then, Americans were craving something different, something outside the beltway. His tan colored suit signaled that he was going to do things his way. It signaled that he was that change. Ten years later, Americans still want change they can believe in. Despite her policies, her record, her personal beliefs, Harris, as a powerful Black and Indian woman, will never be inside the beltway. Indeed, Harris’ fashion choices will be picked apart and analyzed in ways Barack Obama could never even fathom. She may as well wear a tan suit."
Supreme Court rejects Biden administration bid to allow student loan relief,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 12:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-student-loan-relief-biden-rcna168671,"The Supreme Court declined to reinstate the Biden administration’s latest student loan relief program, keeping a lower court’s sweeping injunction in place while litigation continues, raising further uncertainty for borrowers. In an unsigned order Wednesday, without any justices noting their disagreement, the high court rejected the federal government’s application to vacate the injunction, which the government told the justices “has scrambled the Department’s administration of loans for millions of borrowers.” The order said that the court “expects that the Court of Appeals will render its decision with appropriate dispatch,” referring to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued the injunction during litigation over the legality of the effort. The case could return to the justices after the circuit court rules on the merits of the issue. The move follows the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority striking down a previous Biden administration loan relief effort last year. The latest one at issue here is known as the SAVE plan, an income-driven repayment effort that, like last year’s case, was challenged by Republican-led states who sued to block the Biden administration plan. Wednesday’s order marks the justices’ latest emergency ruling this summer ahead of their next term beginning in October.

"As the GOP targets Harris’ border wall stance, the details matter",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 11:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-targets-harris-border-wall-stance-details-matter-rcna168652,"Sen. JD Vance, the Republican Party’s vice presidential nominee, mocked the idea this week that Vice President Kamala Harris “wants to build the border wall.” Hours later, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on Fox News and told viewers, “Graham: Do you really believe she’s going to build a wall? That’s just bulls---.” As for what prompted the partisan pushback, it apparently stems from a report Axios published. The headline read, “Harris flip-flops on building the border wall,” and the article began: A typical person reading this might believe that the Democratic presidential hopeful recently endorsed investing in a border wall, but that’s not quite what happened. Let’s take a brief stroll down memory lane. As regular readers might recall, it was last fall when congressional Republicans said they were so desperate to deal with U.S./Mexico border policies that they took a radical step: GOP officials said that unless Democrats agreed to a series of conservative reforms, Republicans were prepared to cut off military aid to Ukraine and let Russia take part of Eastern Europe by force. Democrats, left with little choice, agreed to pay the GOP’s ransom and endorsed a conservative, bipartisan compromise. At that point, Republicans killed the compromise plan they’d demanded — largely because Donald Trump told them to. Making matters worse, the calculus was electoral, not substantive: The former president didn’t want Congress to hand President Joe Biden an election-year victory on one of the party’s top priorities. Republicans followed Trump’s lead and concluded that they’d rather have a campaign issue than a solution. What does this have to do with allegations of Harris “flip-flopping”? The bipartisan compromise, which featured concessions from both parties, included some wall funding in the hopes of generating GOP support. It was a relatively modest sum — $650 million, roughly 3% of what the Trump administration sought in 2018 — and the funding wasn’t even new. (As Team Harris reminded Axios, the provision “just extended the timeline to spend funds that had been appropriated during Trump’s last year as president.”) The vice president has never been a wall advocate — in fact, she’s been a fierce critic of Trump’s plan — but she endorsed the Senate agreement in the hopes of getting something done on the issue. Six months after Republicans killed the deal they requested, using Harris' convention speech as a news hook, Axios summarized this in bullet-point form, at which point the right effectively declared, “A ha!” As lines of attack go, this is weak tea. If the Democratic nominee were to actually endorse the merits of a border wall, that would be a dramatic reversal worthy of attention. But her willingness to back a bipartisan compromise — which included provisions she and her party would not support on their own — does not a “flip-flop” make."
Sarah Palin wins new trial against New York Times in defamation case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 10:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/sarah-palin-new-york-times-defamation-appeal-rcna168606,"Former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin won a new defamation trial against the New York Times on Wednesday, with a federal appeals court panel citing multiple legal errors in the case. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rebuked the trial judge (though it didn’t remove him) in reviving Palin’s lawsuit against the paper and its former opinion editor James Bennett. The New York-based appellate panel highlighted “several major issues” at the trial presided over by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, specifically “the erroneous exclusion of evidence, an inaccurate jury instruction, a legally erroneous response to a mid-deliberation jury question, and jurors learning during deliberations of the district court’s Rule 50 dismissal ruling.” The Times said in a statement after the ruling, “This decision is disappointing. We’re confident we will prevail in a retrial.” The suit stemmed from a 2017 Times editorial called “America’s Lethal Politics,” which compared two political shootings: the 2011 killing of six people and the injury of 13 others in Arizona, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat; and the 2017 Virginia shooting that seriously injured four people, including Rep. Stephen Scalise, R-La., at a congressional baseball game practice. The Times editorial argued there was a clear and direct link between the Arizona shooting and the political incitement arising from a digital graphic published in March 2010 by Palin’s political action committee. The graphic was a map that superimposed crosshairs over 20 congressional districts represented by Democrats, including Giffords’.  But a relationship between the crosshairs map and the shooting “was never established,” the circuit panel wrote, adding that the incident was rather “viewed as a tragic result” of the shooter’s serious mental illness. (A correction on the editorial currently reads: “An editorial on Thursday about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs.”) Wednesday’s ruling for Palin is the latest appellate outing in her favor. In 2019, the circuit previously reversed the trial court’s dismissal of the case. This latest ruling stems from the 2022 trial.  During jury deliberations, the judge decided that he sided with the defense and would render what’s known as judgment as a matter of law (the Rule 50 dismissal to which the appeals court referred). The judge said that he would dismiss the case only after the jury had returned its verdict but wouldn’t tell the jury about his decision so as not to interfere with the verdict.  The jury found the defense not liable, but it turned out that several jurors had learned about the judge’s ruling before they reached their verdict, from push notifications on their phones.  On appeal, Palin challenged both the verdict and the Rule 50 decision, and the circuit court agreed that both must be vacated.  “Given a judge’s special position of influence with a jury, we think a jury’s verdict reached with the knowledge of the judge’s already-announced disposition of the case will rarely be untainted, no matter what the jurors say upon subsequent inquiry,” the panel wrote in its decision, authored by Judge John Walker, an appointee (and cousin) of former President George H.W. Bush. He was joined by George W. Bush appointee Reena Raggi and Donald Trump appointee Richard Sullivan. But the panel declined to reassign the case to a new judge — a subject that is also top of mind in special counsel Jack Smith’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case. “On remand, we are confident that the district judge will adhere to the principle of complete impartiality, and its appearance, in fulfilling his future judicial responsibilities in this case,” Walker wrote of the Clinton-appointed judge.

All live on stage. All in one day.   Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi everyone. It is the morning of Wednesday, August 28th. Welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is actually the 100th episode as for those listeners who just heard us yesterday -- Mary McCord: Yesterday. Andrew Weissmann: -- talking about our 99th episode thinking that we were going to be recording next week our 100th episode. Well, we’re doing an emergency episode in light of the fact that there was a superseding indictment handed down by a D.C. grand jury yesterday. So we wanted to talk about that quickly. And before we forget, in case anyone doesn’t know, I’m Andrew Weissman. I’m the co-host of “Prosecuting Donald Trump” and I’m here with my wonderful co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: Hi. Okay, let’s get started. So, Mary, gee, what’s on our dance card? Mary McCord: Yeah, that’s right. That is all we’re talking about. This is going to be a shorter episode than usual, but we just thought it was so important in light of the fact that there is this new indictment. And this indictment was presented to a new grand jury, not the same grand jury that had returned the original indictment. And we’ll talk about why that was. Jack Smith even told the court that it was bringing this new indictment to reflect the government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States. That is the immunity decision. And so that is what Jack Smith’s team has been doing ever since that decision got handed down and listeners will know that this Friday, both Jack Smith’s team and Mr. Trump’s team are due to provide to Judge Chutkan in D.C. where this superseding indictment was returned a proposal for how to go forward with pretrial proceedings. So obviously, if this new indictment was to affect that, which it will, they needed to get it returned before this Friday. It explains some of that delay, though, and the reasons for delay and asking for more time to file things in front of the court, I think. So let’s break down what’s different about it, but first, you know, some level setting on that opinion just to remind listeners, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So one question I have gotten repeatedly is people saying, well, why didn’t they ask, since it’s a new indictment, for this to get to a different judge? Remember, this is, as Mary said, this is the D.C. case. This is not the Florida case where that would be a logical question, which is, like how do you get out of Judge Cannon’s courtroom? This is in front of Judge Chutkan, who has been a very good judge by all accounts for both sides. So to answer Mary’s question, let’s level set, what is the Supreme Court immunity decision in brief that this indictment responds to? Remember that that decision said that for core presidential functions defined very broadly to include interactions between the president and his or her Department of Justice, core functions are absolutely immune. Not a balancing, nothing like that, absolutely immune. So the part of the indictment that would be out are the allegations about Donald Trump’s pressuring interactions with the Department of Justice to get them to say that there was some kind of fraud investigation going on, even a sham investigation. That’s point one. Point two is they said even with respect to other official acts that were undertaken by the president outside of the core functions, for those other official acts, and again, potentially defined broadly, although they didn’t set the exact scope, they are at least presumptively immune. They didn’t decide whether they were absolutely immune. They left that to another day, but they said, for our purposes, they were at least presumptively immune, and that could be rebutted by the department. The test that they set out was quite strict, but that sort of gets too much in the weeds. But that’s the basic parameters of what Jack Smith was dealing with. And thus we have this superseding indictment, and Mary, I know that you have done a lot in the last few hours -- Mary McCord: Twelve hours. Andrew Weissmann: -- that we’ve had to talk about what’s deleted and what’s added because since a lot of commentators have talked about what’s deleted, but that’s only half of the equation. There’s deletions and additions. So Mary, let me turn it over to you. Mary McCord: Sure. Yes. And like you said, this is all about Jack Smith trying to come into conformity with that decision and to be able to for even things that, well, be able to show two things. One, what we’re charging here is not even official acts. And then even if it is, we can rebut this presumption by showing that criminal prosecution for these particular acts would not cause any danger to the authority and functions of the presidency. And that’s why they’ve now parsed this and they’ve done it directly in response to the Supreme Court. And as you indicated, because the Supreme Court said that the president’s interactions with his own Department of Justice and executive branch officials, including White House advisors, is core presidential functions and absolutely immune, that is all eliminated from the superseding indictment. So, Jeffrey Clark, who was a Department of Justice high level official there, who was ready to expand upon Trump’s false claims of election fraud and pressure states to open investigations and things like that, Jeffrey Clark’s not even listed as a co-conspirator. The indictment makes clear that all other co-conspirators were acting in their private capacity, and none of them were government officials. It eliminates all allegations of discussions with all Department of Justice officials, all executive branch officials, including the entire section on the defendant’s attempt to leverage the Department of Justice to use deceit to get state officials to replace legitimate electors and electoral votes with the defendants. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what you were saying about Jeffrey Clark is a really good example of deletion and addition. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: Because there’s deletion, there used to be six unindicted co-conspirators, one of them was widely believed to be Jeffrey Clark. There are now five. And an example of deletion is taking out all the stuff about Jeffrey Clark and, as you said, the Department of Justice. But the addition is that with respect to the five unindicted co-conspirators that remain, the superseding indictment is very clear that they are private counsel. Mary McCord: That’s true. Andrew Weissmann: These are private actors. In other words, there’s lots of language about the president acting in his capacity as a candidate or as a private person. Mary McCord: Now you’re getting to my part, Andrew. This is my part. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, but the idea is that there’s very much this sort of subtraction and addition. Mary McCord: That’s right. And that’s why I made the point that as for the other co-conspirators, the indictment’s clear. They were private attorneys, private political advisors. Another thing eliminated is conversations with the vice president about just election fraud generally, and instead what is included in the indictment, again, so that’s the elimination. And what is added in the indictment is just not added, but what remains in the indictment with respect to the conversations that Trump had with Vice President Pence are those that focus on Trump’s attempts to remain in power, to pressure Mike Pence not to count the legitimate electoral votes from the swing states and instead count the fraudulent slates of electors. So they’ve taken out anything where Trump is suggesting there was fraud and here’s why we know it and we should investigate it and they leave just the things about him remaining in power. It eliminates similarly tweets and public statements that are about election fraud, but leaves in tweets and public statements that falsely claimed the vice president could reject legitimate electors. And again, in another edition explains that Trump used Twitter sometimes to communicate with the public as president, those would be things that the Supreme Court called official acts, but also regularly used it for personal purposes. So in each one of these eliminations, they’re taking out something that the Supreme Court has indicated would be within the scope of an official act, and then they’re either adding or emphasizing why what they left in is not official act or at least could rebut the presumption. On other additions that are just flat out additions, and I think these are important go to the point you were just making about a candidate. One of the things the Supreme Court pointed out is there’s a difference between the President acting as President, right, within the functions and authority of a President, which is a likely, according to the Supreme Court, mean that those things are official acts and the President functioning in his personal capacity or as a candidate. So the new indictment adds in many different places, Trump’s role here was as a candidate. And in fact, it even emphasizes that Trump had filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit. This is in December of 2020, a lawsuit brought by a state attorneys general that had sought to invalidate the results of the election in Pennsylvania and some of the other swing states. Trump specifically, when he moved through his attorneys to intervene in that lawsuit, his legal filing said he was doing this in his role as a candidate, right? So in your role as a candidate, can’t be an official act. The indictment also, every time it refers to the January 6th speech on the ellipsis, it calls it Trump’s campaign speech. And at one point explains that’s a speech that was privately funded and privately organized, again, can’t be presidential and official if it’s privately funded and organized and it’s a campaign speech. And the other thing it always does is referred to the vice president when he is exercising that role to count the Electoral College votes on January 6th, preside over the joint session of Congress, always adds the phrase, vice president as presiding on January 6th as president of the Senate. So that is not his executive branch role as a vice president and advisor to Trump. It is his role under Article 1 of the Constitution as president of the Senate. So again, not an official act. Also adds that Trump had no official responsibility related to certification, but did have a personal interest as a candidate. And finally adds in multiple places that also Trump had no official responsibilities relating to the convening of legitimate electors or their signing or mailing in of the certificates of vote. So it’s trying to differentiate things that are in his official role as president and things that are in his personal capacity or that he has no official responsibility for. Andrew Weissmann: One of the notes that’s fascinating in a little civics lesson is that the vice presidency is a unique role -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- in our constitutional firmament because the vice president is a part of the executive branch. However, when the vice president is acting to certify the votes, acts, and also can be a tiebreaker, the vice president is also part of the legislative branch. Mary McCord: That’s Article 1, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So that’s sort of exactly what you’re referring to, Article 1 versus Article 2. Article 1 is legislative. Article 2 is executive and that’s referring to the articles within the Constitution of the United States. So the vice president, very unusual -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- role to be in both, because usually it’s you’re either fish or fowl. You’re not fish and fowl, but he is. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So let’s take a quick break, and then we can talk about sort of what this means. So what’s the effect and why we think he did this? Mary McCord: Absolutely. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. So now that we’ve kind of gone through the eliminations and the additions in the superseding indictment, we’re going to get a little bit into why Jack Smith made these calls and how effective we think this new strategy will be. Let’s start with you, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So I think one of the things that I think people should focus on is sort of the actual effect of the Supreme Court decision on a trial if it were to occur, which is only going to ever happen if just to be clear, if Kamala Harris is actually elected. If Donald Trump is elected, the whole case goes away. So it’s sort of irrelevant. And very much for our listeners who have looked at and followed us with respect to what’s happening in the Manhattan case, where there’s this pending motion having to do with the use of official act evidence, even in a case involving unofficial charges. Here, the whole idea is to try and sanitize the upcoming trial of allegations that are official act evidences to which that cannot be rebutted. So there’s going to be litigation over this. But let me just talk about very specifically what I think is lost, at least in the indictment stage. And that is one of the things that the initial indictment did very well is to support the idea that Donald Trump knew that what he was doing was fraudulent, that he knew he had lost the election. There was a whole litany of people who told him that. And that is very much curtailed because, as you said, Mary, the allegations having to do with people at the Department of Justice, executive branch people speaking to Donald Trump as president, for instance, CISA that looks at it as sort of election fraud and election security within the Department of Homeland Security, those kinds of allegations are removed. And so that litany, it’s not that it doesn’t exist at all. It’s that the primary function comes from either state people saying that or campaign people telling Donald Trump that. So there still is evidence to show that, if proved, that Donald Trump knew that it was fraudulent. But the panoply is curbed because of the Supreme Court decision. Mary McCord: Yeah, and I think, you know, that again comes back to the fact that what the Supreme Court said was within core constitutional responsibilities of the president is his leadership of his own executive branch. So all of, you know, his acting attorney general, acting deputy attorney general telling him there was no fraud significant enough to change the outcome and there’s no basis for investigation, that’s out. But the four charges are the same as they were originally. There’s first the conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, and that is to defeat the federal governmental function through dishonesty, fraud, and deceit. And those include all of the schemes to prevent the actual legitimate counting of the electoral ballots on January 6th. The second is a conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, that official proceeding being the January 6th joint session of Congress to count the Electoral College ballots. There’s also a direct charge of obstruction of official proceeding. And these are things we can talk about in a future episode about how those survive the Fischer case, the other case about obstruction that had to do with the rioters. And then finally, there’s a charge of conspiracy to violate civil rights, that meaning people’s rights to vote and have their votes counted. So all of these conspiracies do require knowledge, right? Knowledge of the fact that there really was no serious election fraud and knowledge that what the president was saying was false. But what does remain, Andrew, and I think it is in here powerfully, is the fact that state officials, right, Secretary of State in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the leadership of the state legislature in Arizona, they were telling the president very directly, Mr. President, we have looked, we have done audits, we have done recounts, we have examined this, there is no significant fraud in our states. So it is still there, but it is curtailed, as you said. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, and also internal campaign people telling him, because again, that would not be official conduct that would be as a candidate -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- to get back to your point at the outset. So the question arises is, why do this? Why now? So I think there are a number of reasons why you would do this. One, it creates a very clean look. In other words, there’s so much that’s sort of added and subtracted that it’s not like you can just tell the court, oh, you know, where we’re not relying on allegations in paragraphs seven and 12. There’s a lot here. And so sending a very, very detailed letter, it’s so much that it’s sort of a much cleaner canvas to work off of because everybody knows what’s in and what’s out because it’s there. That’s sort of one. The other more substantive reason is that to extend that Donald Trump was going to make claims in the district court and up to and including the Supreme Court, that the grand jury process was tainted by the introduction of evidence and conduct that is immunized, and the grand jury shouldn’t have considered it, this takes that off the table. So from a defensive point of view, it’s basically we don’t need to litigate that. It is easy enough to go back to the grand jury and pointedly, as you pointed out at the very outset, Jack Smith made a point of telling the court this is a new grand jury. And so they could be given, it could be sanitized evidence. They also could be told exactly what the law is, because the law has now changed dramatically. So it is, from a defensive point of view, it takes an issue off the table. And then final point I’ll make is that from an offensive position, it actually has, as you pointed out, it’s not just deletions, it’s also additions. So you actually have a grand jury that has made findings because it has to vote on all of the language in the superseder just so people know that what happens when an indictment is presented to a grand jury, you read to them, they get handed out the proposed superseding indictment. Very often it is read word for word, but they are following along and seeing all of it, and they can raise questions and issues, and they don’t have to vote on it to say we agree with everything. So the grand jury has actually made findings based on probable cause of those additions. And so that’s something for those people who are counting, this now makes five grand juries that have found probable cause to believe that the former president committed multiple, multiple, multiple felonies. And because we have four different jurisdictions, but you now have two separate grand juries in D.C. with a pointed reference to the fact this was a new, clean grand jury. Mary McCord: Yeah. And you know, I do think that’s significant. And we know that Trump probably would have raised the grand jury point because he raised it in Manhattan. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: And so, you know, it was smart of Jack Smith to think we’re just going to present this anew. So where do we go from here in our closing to this episode? Friday, we will hear from the parties on their proposal for going forward. I suspect that there will be the Trump team seeking, you know, legal briefing before anything. You know, everyone keeps asking the question, will there be an evidentiary hearing? And I think one of the things that Jack Smith has tried to do in this indictment, because it’s returned by a grand jury based on probable cause, these allegations that should be taken as the allegations and that set up an argument that he can win on the law without needing an evidentiary hearing, which I don’t think there’s any way could happen before the election anyway, and I don’t think he’s going to ask for that. But I think Trump will not want an evidentiary hearing for obvious reasons. Andrew Weissmann: Of course not. Mary McCord: He will want just to be on the law. So it wouldn’t surprise me if they don’t first battle it out. Trump will say, look, let’s take the allegations that are currently in the indictment and I’m going to argue why they still are official acts for which the president is immune. Rule on that Judge Chutkan before you rule on anything else. Jack Smith, we’ll see how he responds. I’m speculating here on how I think it will play out. But I suspect that we’ll start with legal briefing and then decide if there are things that require evidentiary development because the Supreme Court did leave open the door in each of these areas pressure on Vice President Pence, pressure on state legislators and the false electoral scheme, and also the tweets and public statements on January 6th. They left open the door that factually that could be an area where the government could rebut any presumption of official acts or show that the conduct was not official because it was in his role as a candidate or is in his personal capacity or about things he had no responsibility for or vice president was acting in his Article 1 role. So there may be some things there, but I think it’ll be an iterative process as we go forward. And we’ll know more Friday and we’ll talk about it on Tuesday. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, so happy 100th episode -- Mary McCord: Yes. Woohoo. Andrew Weissmann: -- this week and not next week. And Happy Labor Day to everybody.

Now Playing in the 11th Circuit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 10:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-now-playing-11th-circuit-rcna168637,"In an attempt to revive the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case thrown out by Judge Aileen Cannon last month, Special Counsel Jack Smith has now filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals, a day early no less. MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord discuss Jack Smith’s arguments in the brief asserting that Judge Cannon had wrongfully ruled the special counsel had been appointed illegally. Then, looking ahead at proposals in the January 6 case expected to be filed later this week. And we take some of your listener questions!  Update: Following this recording, it was reported that Jack Smith revised his indictment in the January 6th case to address the Supreme Court’s ruling on immunity. A procedural filing is still expected this coming Friday, August 30th. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi and welcome back to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday, and Tuesday morning, August 27th, and I’m sort of stressing that, Mary, because we thought that we would be doing this tomorrow, Wednesday morning, and I think we even told people last week that we would be. Mary McCord: We did. Andrew Weissmann: Why is that? Because the brief that Jack Smith filed in the 11th Circuit, appealing Judge Cannon’s ruling, was due today, meaning that he would have up until, I think, kind of midnight to file it. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And so we were going to basically be up very, very late, assuming he was going to file the last minute, and then we were going to record tomorrow morning. But he surprised everyone and he filed a day early. Mary McCord: Not something the government does a lot. Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: At least not when I was in the government. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, no, everything’s always like at the last minute. Mary McCord: Last minute. Andrew Weissmann: No matter how much you prepare, there’s always like proof. There’s always something. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, anyway, here we are. It is August 27th. It is 10:22 a.m. And we both have leisurely read the brief. Mary McCord: Yeah. I didn’t have to stay up late to read it. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So Mary, gee, what’s on our dance card today? Mary McCord: Yeah. And by the way, I’m Andrew’s co-host, Mary McCord. Good morning and good evening, whatever you happen to be listening. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, everyone knows except for our new listeners. So welcome our new listeners. Mary McCord: Yes, so obviously we’re going to spend quite a bit of time today talking about that filing. That is of course the appeal of Judge Cannon’s dismissal of the entire Mar-a-Lago prosecution on the grounds that Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. And then we will talk about, really, we’ll just kind of anticipate what the parties will file on Friday in the D.C. January 6 related case. The parties are due to file a joint proposal for how to proceed in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. And if they have disagreements and can’t agree to spell those disagreements out, then the court will actually hear from them next week on September the 5th. And then we are going to get to some listener questions. We have some really good ones. Andrew Weissmann: I know, they’re amazing. Mary McCord: Yes, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: They’re really amazing, so keep them coming and thank you. The quality is keeping us on our toes. They’re excellent. But Mary, let’s turn to the brief that was filed. And I thought maybe we’d start with something that is not totally substantive about what their position is, but rather sort of the tone and sort of the tenor of the brief. And then we’ll go to the substance of the argument and then maybe what was not said. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Which is big. But I just thought it might be worth a note that this was an incredibly dignified brief in my view, in terms of tone. It read in a very dispassionate way. In some ways it reminds me, this isn’t quite an anecdote, not this early. But I remember once we had such an outrageous thing that had happened on the defense side, that our submission to the district court judge, every single adjective and adverb was taken out. We just set out the law and the facts as dispassionately as possible. And in some ways, it was more devastating by doing that. And that was my reaction to this that some people might have wanted to see more hammer and tongs, but I thought that the tenor of it was both the right tone for the 11th Circuit, where they don’t know who their panel is yet, so they don’t know which judge they might get, but also made it stronger. Mary McCord: I mean, in general, that was certainly always my approach and I think the government’s approach generally to briefing is that they don’t have a dog in the fight in the sense of trying to be overly hyperbolic. The government feels like what it’s trying to do is to do justice for the American people and the best way to do that is to use the facts and the law in support of your arguments as opposed to adjectives and adverbs. And this is something that I’ve carried with me having left the government, you know, having spent a large chunk of my time in government doing appellate work. But even in my work at ICAP now in my day job, oftentimes my role when I review a brief is to take out all those adjectives and adverbs that people put in when they draft because they’re mad or it’s cathartic -- Andrew Weissmann: They’re triggered. Mary McCord: -- or they’re triggered, right. And then here comes Mary, like, we’re taking that adjective out, we’re taking this adjective out. And everyone knows it, all the attorneys who I work with, they know it, they’re like, that first draft, you just got to get out all your, you know, strong feelings about how wrong the lower court was when you’re the one on appeal, but then you want to come back, you want to take a step back. You want to just let your arguments on the law and how the law applies to the facts and how the trial court got it wrong, or if you’re defending the trial court, how the trial court got it right and do that through the persuasiveness of your arguments rather than the hyperbolic nature of your rhetoric. And that’s where I think we see a difference. And we have yet to see the responsive brief by Mr. Trump’s attorneys. But if you just think about other things that they have filed, including in this case before Judge Cannon, theirs have always been more hyperbolic than what -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- we’ve seen from the government. Although I will say some of the briefing in some of the appellate’s briefs in the January 6 related case was, I’d say, somewhat toned down from what had been briefed in the trial court, even on Mr. Trump’s side. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, it’s a big spectrum, I suspect, based on who is writing it. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Just to be clear what Mary and I are saying for our listeners, is not that this isn’t a strong sort of hash it -- Mary McCord: Right. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- brief in terms of laying out why Judge Cannon is wrong. So this is really a question of tone and style. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And it can go a long way in persuasion with respect to with the -- Mary McCord: And credibility. Andrew Weissmann: -- 11th Circuit. Exactly. And especially since they do not know who their audience is, but the right thing to do and strategically the right thing to do. But maybe there’s a good segue to -- Mary McCord: What’s it say? Andrew Weissmann: -- what’s it say. And I have to tell you, this felt like just incoming. Mary McCord: It did. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, we knew that Judge Cannon was wrong, but seeing it laid out page after page. It’s about 51 pages of actual argument on this issue. And it’s primarily on the issue of the appointment of the special counsel. Does the attorney general have the power to appoint a special counsel? There’s a small bit about the financing. It’s basically like a throwaway -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- because there’s just nothing to that argument from Judge Cannon. And I’d say it’s in two sort of chunks, one longer than the other. But their first point is because they’re arguing to the 11th Circuit, which is a court of appeals, but has to follow Supreme Court precedent. The first point is that this was decided in the Nixon case and it wasn’t dicta, and that the 11th Circuit has to follow it. We can talk about that more. And then the second issue is how the text of the congressional statutes and the history and interpretation of the Department of Justice, of the courts, of even Congress and how they viewed it is all on the side of even if you didn’t have that Supreme Court decision, that is binding on the 11th Circuit. Even if you got to the issue of is there a statute that authorizes this for the attorney general to appoint a special counsel, that all of those things, the tax, the history, the consistent interpretation, the other court decisions are all uniformly against -- Mary McCord: Congress continuing to fund things and never legislating in a way that would take away the power that the attorney general had been exercising time and time again throughout history. I think that’s an important part too of statutory interpretation. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. In fact, can we just say on that, not only did they not change it, but they’ve actually been assuming -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- that, of course, this is the case that the special counsel could be appointed. And just to be clear, it’s not political. Democrats and Republicans have done the same thing. In other words, you have Democratic administrations and your Republican administrations all appointing special counsels. Some special counsels are within the department, some special counsels are initially outside of the department, and then they’re brought in to do this job. And the brief is, I think, just devastating. Mary McCord: Well, it certainly historical and it actually does grammar lessons on things like what a past participle is and how past participles can still be used in the present tense. So I was like, ooh, this has taken me back to high school English when you used to have the diagram sentences. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Like I’m sure no one listening remembers that except those of us -- Andrew Weissmann: I remember it. Mary McCord: Oh my gosh. I don’t think they do that anymore. Anyway, let’s go back to the -- Andrew Weissmann: Wait, you don’t think they diagram sentences? Mary McCord: I don’t remember my kids who are now in their 20s, I do not remember them diagramming sentences, but I could be wrong about that. Andrew Weissmann: Wow. Mary McCord: It’s not like I looked at all their homework, but I don’t think so. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, by the way, you know Mary, we’re now going to get, like, this is -- Mary McCord: Oh, I know. Andrew Weissmann: -- we’re crowdsourcing. Mary McCord: All kinds of people are going to be writing to us about diagramming sentences. And our producer’s looking at us like, what are you talking about? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly because he’s born -- Mary McCord: He’s much younger than us. Andrew Weissmann: -- in a generation where they didn’t diagram sentences. Mary McCord: That’s right. Yes, that’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Mary McCord: Okay, let’s go back to the dictum point because I think this is important. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: So, United States versus Nixon, this was a case that went to the Supreme Court. It is a case where the special counsel appointed to investigate Watergate, the Watergate scandal, had issued a subpoena to President Nixon for the White House tapes and other information. And so he went in to challenge that and the case is primarily about executive privilege. He said he had executive privilege not to turn over the things that were subpoenaed by the special prosecutor. So the court first had to determine, was this case even justiciable because it did go up to the Supreme Court? Meaning, what Nixon had argued is, this is just an intra-agency dispute, because I’m the president of the United States. This special prosecutor is trying to get documents, the court shouldn’t bother with this at all. And the court said, no, this is justiciable. This is something that we can rule on because the special prosecutor was appointed pursuant to statutes that the attorney general used to make this appointment and a regulation issued by the Department of Justice. That regulation is in play. While it’s in play, I mean, it’s still enforced. It’s never been repealed. That regulation governs here for the special counsel to be able to seek these documents. So we will now rule substantively on your claim of executive privilege. And the issue there was is that the Supreme Court said that the test that a special prosecutor has to show is really this compelling need for the information in furtherance of his responsibilities in this criminal investigation, one that essentially a balancing test based on his compelling need for the information here. Again, we’re talking about the Watergate tapes and other information, and that outweighed any concerns about executive privilege. So what the special counsel now, Jack Smith, is saying is Judge Cannon was wrong to say that it was just dicta in the Supreme Court that the special prosecutor appointed in Watergate was constitutionally appointed, that that’s just dicta, that that didn’t matter, that the court assumed it was lawful and went on to decide the executive privilege question. And that’s just flat out wrong. If you go and you read the case, the court didn’t say we are assuming that the special prosecutor was lawfully appointed and now we’ll rule on executive privilege. They went through, as I was just explaining, the fact that the special prosecutor was appointed under a set of regulations that were authorized and that is where the authority comes from. And so to just give a thought or two about dicta, because people may be saying, what is dicta? Andrew Weissmann: Right, yeah. That’s what I was going to get to, yeah, exactly. Mary McCord: So dicta mean sometimes courts will say, we’re not going to resolve every issue in front of us, we’re going to get to the issue we care about and we’re going to either assume something and not actually have the parties argue it, not make a decision on it. We’ll just assume it and we’ll go on to the next thing. Sometimes they will also be issuing a decision and they’ll say a few things about something else. And in fact, we’ve seen that in the 14th Amendment section three case and other cases, they say a few things, but those are not load bearing. In other words, they are not an essential -- Andrew Weissmann: It’s embroidery. Mary McCord: Yeah, it’s embroidery. This in U.S. v. Nixon was necessary to the holding. Andrew Weissmann: Right. By the way, that is what the D.C. Circuit said when they were -- Mary McCord: Every circuit and every court. Andrew Weissmann: -- reviewing this issue. They said this was necessary. I have to say it’s so disrespectful of Judge Cannon because she’s thinking, you know what, I want to get this, I’m just going to ignore the Supreme Court because the current Supreme Court might have a different view. But as a district court judge, you don’t have that luxury. Mary McCord: You don’t. Andrew Weissmann: You have to be faithful to the Supreme Court decision even if you disagree with it. And she could have said, you know what, I disagree with this, blah, blah, blah, but I’m bound by it. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And she didn’t. To me, it’s just another badge of being triggered. Let’s just be polite, poorly reasoned her decision and outcome determinative. So that’s how she put aside the Nixon case and I -- Mary McCord: And I think she did feel empowered by Justice Thomas’s -- Andrew Weissmann: But it was only one justice, right? Mary McCord: That’s right, I know. But I think, as we talked about after the immunity decision came down, when Justice Thomas wrote separately to talk about the appointment of the special prosecutor, I mean, it’s not even dicta because it wasn’t part of the majority opinion. It’s just one justice’s opinion on something that had never even been argued or briefed in the Supreme Court in the immunity case. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: But that I think she saw as, ooh, this is my -- Andrew Weissmann: It’s an invitation. Yeah. Mary McCord: -- open door, yeah, to go ahead and talk about this. Andrew Weissmann: So then the court went on to go through all the various statutes. And I wanted to sort of highlight two points, Mary. One is, sort of big picture that I think people will understand about what Judge Cannon was saying and the ludicrousness that Congress would have had this kind of statutory scheme in mind. According to Judge Cannon, the sin of all sins here was that Jack Smith was outside the department and then was appointed and then in the department. Leave aside that she makes the fundamental error that we’ve talked about where she describes him as a private attorney because he was a private attorney, but then he’s hired as special counsel, so then he’s in the department. And she says there has to be essentially a time gap where the person was outside the department, then they’re in the department, then it would be okay to give him the role of special counsel. In other words, as long as the person is in the department, then they can be a special counsel. In other words, the attorney general could just take somebody from within the department and make them a special counsel, but the sin here is having hired them from outside the department. And one of the things that the brief says is -- Mary McCord: And can I just interject that this is where the past participle point comes in? Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly. But the big picture, I mean, yes, they have a linguistic relevance, but the big picture about how ludicrous it is, they said that could be one second from -- Mary McCord: Yeah, you could hire him. Okay, now he’s been retained. He’s now a department employee. Now we’re going to appoint him. Andrew Weissmann: Right, which is just insane that that would be their view. And she does that based on this past participle argument that --- Mary McCord: And the words are -- Andrew Weissmann: Go ahead, yeah. Yes. Mary McCord: -- the statute of Section 515B of the Title 28 of the U.S. Code empowers the attorney general to commission attorneys who are, and here’s the quote, who are specially retained under authority of the Department of Justice as special assistants to the attorney general or special attorneys. So she takes specially retained and say, that’s the past tense, which means you have to have already been retained in the Department of Justice before you can be appointed as a special assistant to the attorney general or a special attorney. And that is a past participle, specially retained, and according to the brief and to grammar rules and grammar scholars who are quoted or grammarians who are quoted, is that a word? I think it is. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, it is. Mary McCord: Specially retained in that usage even as a past participle is being used in the present tense. So anyway, it’s kind of interesting aside because I’m reading it, I’m like, I can’t believe we’re getting -- Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: -- a brief on the use of past participles. But anyway, to your point, specially retained, even if you took her point of it having to be past tense. Again, okay, we hire him. Now he’s retained. Five minutes later, we appoint him as special counsel. Andrew Weissmann: One second. They literally say one second would work. Mary McCord: They do. So it’s kind of ridiculous. Andrew Weissmann: So one other point, which I thought was really smart, a smart messaging to the 11th Circuit, and I think smart in terms of where this could go in terms of potential Supreme Court review, which is that in two places in the brief, they specifically call out writings or roles that two of the current justices have -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- taken in the past. So on page 42, they make reference to a law review article that Brett Kavanaugh wrote called “The President and the Independent Counsel.” It was in the Georgia Law Journal in 1998, where he talks about the quote, “deeply rooted tradition of appointing an outside prosecutor to run particular investigations.” Notice outside prosecutor, just to the point that we were just making. And that’s something, by the way, I’m going to give a shout out to Lawrence O’Donnell because many, many months ago, he had found this and had a whole show where he very much was like reading chapter and verse from what Justice Kavanaugh. Mary McCord: From Brett Kavanaugh. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Second, in footnote 22, this is something that we talked about, Mary, in a prior episode, which is that the brief has a footnote talking about when the Independent Counsel Act was sunsetting. That was after Ken Starr, who was appointed an independent counsel and people had sort of issues with it. Mary McCord: Under a statute, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly, when that statute was sunsetting, people said, well, you know, there were two ways to appoint a special counsel. One was under the Independent Counsel Act, but the attorney general always had this other authority, which is what’s at issue here. And that is something that is called out in footnote 22, because when the Independent Counsel Act was sunsetting, there was a bipartisan commission that was sort of put together, commission’s probably the wrong word, but sort of group of eight distinguished citizens, that’s how it’s described. And it was Senators Robert Dole and George Mitchell, hence the bipartisan nature. And the eight distinguished citizens included one member who is the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts. And it was to study and recommend alternatives to the Independent Counsel Act. And what the footnote points out is, although the ultimate recommendation was to have sort of legislative cure, what the report said, and I’m going to, again, quote from this, is quote, “since creation of the Department of Justice in 1870, the attorney general has had standing statutory authority, now in 28 U.S.C. Section 515, to retain a counsel as a special assistant to the attorney general or as a special attorney.” So again, has standing statutory authority since 1870. And I thought it was just so notable that they had these two sorts of shout outs to these current Supreme Court justices. Mary McCord: Yeah, absolutely. And when you talk about sort of devastating stuff in the brief, I think that’s it. I have two more things I want to talk about. One is fallout, fallout from this Judge Cannon decision and also what’s not in this brief. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But let’s take a break and come back and talk about those things. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. So we have been talking about the U.S. government’s appellate brief in the 11th Circuit now. And I want to talk about, you know, we had whole episodes about the fallout of the immunity decision, the Supreme Court’s immunity decision, and some of that fallout meaning collateral consequences, other things that were called into question. And one of the things that really stood out to me in this brief by Jack Smith and his team is their argument about essentially the fallout, the collateral consequences of Judge Cannon’s decision if it were to be affirmed. And this is actually on page 56 of the brief. They’re saying that the district court’s reasoning also needlessly cast doubt on longstanding practices in the Department of Justice and across the whole Executive Branch. And here’s the key here. It suggests -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- that every special counsel throughout history who was appointed from outside the Department of Justice, who did not assist a U.S. attorney, was invalidly appointed, and that every attorney general who made such appointments acted ultra vires, meaning outside of law, that Congress repeatedly overlooked the persistent pattern of errors and the Supreme Court itself failed to spot that flaw in Nixon. And then they go on, and I’m quoting all this, “but it also goes much further. If the attorney general lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office other than the few that are specifically identified by statute.” And I will note, they say at a minimum, that list includes high-ranking department positions such as the Deputy Solicitor General, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, my old job, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, wouldn’t have been able to appoint me in that position. And the district court’s rationale would likewise raise questions about hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch, including in the departments of defense, state, treasury, and labor, which all rely on statutes resembling those that the attorney general uses, but in those cases to support their secretary’s authority to appoint inferior officers. So again, we’re talking about, look at what she’s done here. If you actually were to affirm that, it would call so many things into question that our government has relied on and Congress and the other branches have just relied on throughout centuries at this point. Andrew Weissmann: So the thing that’s not in the brief -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- that everyone is going to be thinking this is like we need it, we buried the lead -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- which is that Jack Smith does not ask for the 11th Circuit to not just reverse Judge Cannon. That’s obviously what they ask for. But they don’t say, and send it back to a different judge. They don’t say that she should be recused and taken off the case. Now, the court has that power, regardless of the parties ask for it or not. And it’s not very commonly used, but it is something that the court can do. But it is not something that Jack Smith asked for. And I was trying to think of why they may not have done that. I’d be interested in the discussion about whether what you would have done. But when I was thinking about why they may not have done that is one, if you’re asking for that as the part of the relief, it puts a little bit more pressure on getting the main ruling they want, which is a reversal. Now, obviously the court can say we’re going to reverse but we’re not taking her off the case, but it makes it atmospherically a little bit of the thumb on the scale that you are asking for both of those things. The second is it’s a little bit of the cart before the horse in the sense that yes, she has been reversed twice by the 11th Circuit. You could imagine some discussion internally that’s either, you know, we just don’t do that, we leave it to the court to do. And second, as an institution matter, that’s not something that the department engages in. You get sort of stuck with who you’re assigned. But the second is that, let’s see what the 11th Circuit and the Supreme Court does with this. If we win it, and it’s an outright sort of slam of her in the way that the 11th Circuit has done before, and we have three decisions now that say she is off the hook. I don’t mean in that sense, like she’s -- Mary McCord: Probably need a different -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: Yeah, probably a different. Andrew Weissmann: Step off the curb. No film on the camera. The elevator doesn’t go to the top. Whatever expression you want to use. You could at that point deal with the issue, but wait for the ultimate win, whether it’s in the 11th Circuit or the Supreme Court before you were to make that decision. And finally, because this case is not going to be heard until after the election, there is an ability to have that particular issue decided in a calmer environment, hopefully, when there either is a Trump presidency, in which case this case is going away and its sort of moot anyway in many ways because the Department of Justice is going to be ordered to just stand down, or it will be a Kamala Harris presidency and it can be dealt with at that point. Mary McCord: Yeah. Well, I don’t disagree with anything, you know, that you’ve said and how you’ve described it. I also would not have sought recusal if I were still in the government and I had been on this brief. I think, you know, first of all, my entire career, I never pushed to seek recusal of a judge. It’s something that the department does very, very rarely. And I think you need to show more concrete evidence of sort of impartiality or bias than even what we have here. And I know some people, listeners are gonna be like, what is wrong with you, Mary? Look at all of her rulings. But I will say, sometimes she has ruled in Jack Smith’s favor, even though a lot of us have a lot of speculation about what biases she may have toward the former president. In the rulings and in her statements in court, I don’t think they always come out in a way that is that clear. And I think that what Jack Smith thinks, and I agree with this, is that we win on the law here and we’re just gonna argue the law and she was wrong on the law and we’re gonna seek her reversal. But we can deal with these kinds of legal issues without having to take her off the case and it would take something more to get to that point. I think they also do not want to look political and that would be inherent, not only in this environment that we’re in generally, but also because we are literally here coming up on the eve of the election. I mean, the Trump brief will be due 30 days after yesterday, which is, I think, September 26. The government’s reply brief will be due 21 days after that, which I think is something like October 17. And at that point, we really, really are practically on the eve of the election. You know, to have recusal be part of this, I think the department was very concerned, as it has been and as it rightfully should be, about not doing anything that could be perceived, even if it’s something warranted, but that could be perceived as being political. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, so we’re going to agree to disagree on this in that I agree with you in terms of not seeking it now, but I think ultimately, they are going to have to seek it because I think she’s so erratic in her rulings and she has so many ways left open to really screw up this case in ways that are unlawful, including what’s called rule 29, meaning she could start the trial and then just get rid of it, and that’s not appealable. So I do think they’re going to have to deal with it. I also think, although I agree with you, that the standard for recusal, which I also have never saw in any case, is and should be very high because you don’t want people to just say, oh, I don’t like the judge, I want a new one. Mary McCord: Right. And I don’t even know that’s a disagreeing. I’m saying I wouldn’t do it now. There may be a time later. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, yeah. Mary McCord: We always figure it out. Yeah, the rest is dicta. Andrew Weissmann: The rest is dicta, right. We wouldn’t have done it now because it can be done later. So Mary, is this a good place to take a break and then we’re gonna briefly talk about what’s gonna happen this Friday with the joint filing and then get to listener questions. Mary McCord: Sounds great. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, let’s speculate about Friday. Friday is when Trump’s team and jack Smith’s team are due to file their proposal for what the order of proceedings should be. What type of proceedings there should be on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court to Judge Tanya Chutkan and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the January 6th case? And I want to give you a little bit of something that I learned from a reporter, and the reporter has now reported this, this is in Bloomberg Law, when he called me to ask me questions about this last week. He said he was hearing that Jack Smith is not going to ask for some sort of mini trial before the election, and that Jack Smith is concerned about a mini trial sort of previewing his hand and he wouldn’t my thoughts on that. I responded, I can see that and that argument, but more importantly, I don’t think there’s even time for a mini trial before the election, even if he wanted one. And I could see him not wanting to try to push for something that, again, might look political and that, you know, I think he’s really going to be focused on. How do we narrow this case in a way that we have our strongest chance as the federal government of being able to put on a case without running afoul of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the immunity case? In other words, how do we make sure everything we’re charging is not an official act and that the evidence we want to use is either not official acts evidence or is something that’s in a public record or, you know, allowed by the Supreme Court’s ruling? And that his focus may be on narrowing it. And I know a lot of people are probably disappointed. And I don’t even know if that’s right. This reporter says he’s getting this from various sources, but that’s what he’s telling me. Andrew Weissmann: So remember, this is the case where the filing was supposed to have been made three weeks ago. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: That the Department of Justice asked for three more weeks to sort of coordinate with other parts of the department as they are required to do because see our earlier discussion, the special counsel is part of the Department of Justice. Mary McCord: Of the department. Andrew Weissmann: And so I do think that this will be interesting, maybe more for us insiders to sort of be tea leaf reading about sort of what they are thinking about how this would apply and what the issues are for other parts of the department. We talked about the National Security Division, civil rights, environmental. There are millions of parts of the department, not just the criminal division and the National Security Divisions that are sort of instrumental to this case. So I think that’s going to be interesting. I agree with you that as a timing matter, it may be hard. I also, on the reporting, the reason that a reporter would have a story like that in my estimation is very frequently, and I saw this when I was on the Mueller investigation, when prosecutors have to have discussions with defense lawyers, and here they do have to because it’s a joint filing, there is nothing that prevents the defense lawyers from speaking to the press. Mary McCord: That’s right. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not even a leak in the sense that it’s not improper. Mary McCord: They’re not under a gag order. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I’m not saying that defense lawyers are lying about it. It’s that it’s not totally clear whether they’ve omitted something and whether things get lost in translation. And when I was reading the “New York Times” reporting on this, that wording was interesting to me because it said things like the Department of Justice is going to seek a major hearing. So that’s consistent with their saying there may have to be some hearing. Mary McCord: Of course, right. Andrew Weissmann: And with facts being presented, but that remains to be seen. Will they ask for a hearing on what issues, how would the facts be adduced? Would it be with live witnesses or could it be through the submission of affidavits or what are called FBI 302s, that’s notes of interviews. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Could it be grand jury testimony that they’re given permission to make public? So a lot of that remains to be seen, but that’s essentially what we’re going to be keeping our eye out for this Friday and you all should be too. Mary McCord: And we’ll be talking a lot about it next Tuesday. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. So, listener questions. Mary, do you want me to give you the first one? Mary McCord: Sure. Andrew Weissmann: We can go back and forth? Mary McCord: Yes, let’s do it. Andrew Weissmann: So here’s the first one from Craig, which is, can the 14th Amendment prohibition under the Insurrection Clause be lifted by a presidential pardon? What do you think? Mary McCord: This takes us back to when we were discussing the case involving the attempt by Colorado to disqualify former President Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment Section 3. Listeners will recall that constitutional amendment says that no one shall hold any office under the United States, including the presidency, who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellions against the Constitution of the United States. And that disqualification in the 14th Amendment Section 3, that is not a criminal conviction, does not require a criminal conviction. The Supreme Court did say it would require some sort of action by Congress, something for Congress to do. It’s not sort of totally self-implementing there. But it would not have to be a criminal conviction. And it’s a criminal conviction that the president has the ability to pardon. Query whether he could pardon himself. That’s an unanswered question. No one’s ever had to answer it. A lot of scholars think he couldn’t. But even putting that aside, what happens in section three is not itself a conviction. Can’t be pardoned. That said, the constitutional amendment itself does provide for a way around that, and that is if Congress, by vote of two-thirds of each House, removes this disability, removes this disqualification. And in fact, that did happen after the Civil War with respect to people who had been found to have engaged in rebellion against the Constitution, insurrection or rebellion, and some of that disability under the 14th Amendment, Section 3, that disqualification was removed by vote of Congress. So it’s something that Congress could act to do something about, but not that a president could just pardon himself from. Andrew Weissmann: By the way, that is like the Halcyon day is where it’s you could think that two thirds of the Congress would do anything. Mary McCord: Could agree on anything. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: Okay, let’s move on. This is a really, really good question from David. Do we now have a Catch-22 with the immunity ruling where a future Supreme Court will only get to reconsider immunity if another president is charged with a crime? If so, it seems like under a normal president, we’ll never get to overturn it, that meaning the decision, and it’ll sit like a bomb waiting for a demagogue to take full advantage of it. Andrew Weissmann: What a great question. I think the answer is that may very well be the case, that it’s hard to figure out what the opportunity will be to have that come up. But I could see a situation where there is a criminal investigation, not a prosecution, but an investigation of a president. And there’s almost like a manufactured challenge, or maybe not even manufactured, to whether that investigation could go forward as to the president. But even that, I think the department could say, well, it’s premature to decide that issue, and it’s premature to decide whether it’s been rebutted and whether it’s core and all of those issues. So it may be possible to think of a way to get the criminal investigation to the Supreme Court, but it would be unusual, to say the least. The other, which would be really difficult, would be for the court on its own with a different makeup to somehow take the opportunity to revisit it in a related case. And the thing that I’m thinking of is in the Trump versus Hawaii case, that is the case that dealt with the so-called Muslim ban. It actually was the third iteration of the Muslim ban. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: The court on its own said as a little throwaway, to be clear, we are overruling Korematsu, the Japanese-American internment case. And it overruled it in the narrowest possible way, by the way. That’s a little like -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- I’m a total nerd, Mary. You know that I teach national security law also, but I’m not going to not digress on that. But that’s the second way in which the court could try to revisit this without the sort of a live case being presented because of the ramifications. Yeah, what do you got? Mary McCord: Well, remember, this case is not over, right? This case is back in front of Judge Chutkan, the January 6th case. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, I love it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love it. Mary McCord: She’s going to make rulings about immunity. She’s going to make rulings about official acts and unofficial acts and evidence that the government can get in. I think, you know, if this case, depending on whether this case remains, because recall, if former President Trump is reelected, he will likely just shut down and order this case dismissed completely. But if that does not happen and the case proceeds, those rulings that Judge Chutkan’s makes are something that probably the Trump team will appeal and could find their way back to the Supreme Court. And at that point, the government certainly could come in and try to explain how some of what the court decided this summer is wrong and unworkable and, you know, not supported by history and essentially try to get them to revisit. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, presumably, I hadn’t really thought of that because it would presumably be in front of the same court. Mary McCord: Same court. Andrew Weissmann: Presumably, it may change. Okay. Excellent point. Let me ask you another question. This one is from Mark. I’m going to read the opening part. Mary McCord: The beginning, I love it. Andrew Weissmann: Because it says, I’m afraid this question may land Andrew back on Trigger Avenue, but here it goes. So by the way, Mark, clearly a frequent listener. Mary McCord: That’s right. He knows Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: And Mark should note that because it does trigger me, I’m going to ask this of Mary, the more level-headed person here. So here’s the question. As you know, Trump has filed, that’s technically wrong. Trump has said that he intends to file. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: He has not yet actually filed, but this says Trump has filed a $100 million lawsuit against the United States for damages caused by the FBI’s raid, that’s in quotes, on Mar-a-Lago. And the question is, if Trump were to file that suit, and if he were to become president again, could he order the Justice Department to settle the lawsuit for many millions of dollars, and thus put taxpayer money right into his pocket legally? Would such a settlement have to be approved by a judge, or is there any other check to prevent this? Mary McCord: This might even trigger me. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So what do you think, Mary? Mary McCord: So, and just to your point on this isn’t a lawsuit yet, just by federal government regulations, you file administrative notice to the Department of Justice of your intent to file that suit and the department has something like 180 days to say, you know what, we’ll go ahead and resolve this and we’ll pay you blah, blah, blah. They’re not going to do that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: I think -- Andrew Weissmann: This -- Mary McCord: Well, this administration -- Andrew Weissmann: That’s the question. Mary McCord: That’s true, 180 days will go into at this point August, barely, but we’ll go into the next administration, I think, if my six-month math is correct, because we are in late August. So I think probably he could. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, he would be the head of the Executive Branch. He would be directing his Department of Justice to take a position in litigation. And there is at least an argument under the immunity ruling that is an official act, communicating with your own Department of Justice. This listener, Mark, probably recalls one of the things we discussed, is that in that immunity ruling, the one thing the court did answer is it said, communications with your attorney general, between the president and the attorney general are official acts. And between the president and other, you know, high level officials at the Department of Justice about investigations and prosecutions, and even if they were sham investigations and prosecutions, are official acts for which the president is immune. Now, immunity, of course, has only to do with his criminal liability. So it doesn’t mean carte blanche, you can do all kinds of corrupt things, but it does mean you will have immunity from any criminal responsibility. But I will say that yes, settlements if there is actually litigation pending do have to be approved by a court. And I do think a judge might look quite askance at something like this, might even try to appoint a special outside amicus lawyer to argue what normally the government would argue in order to defend against a $100 million lawsuit. And so we could see that kind of thing, a court actually intervening to try to prevent something like that from happening. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, just remember when a court, if there is a pending civil lawsuit, would have limited ability to review that. And that has happened in civil cases, for instance, in class action cases, it’s more routine to make sure that the class is being fairly treated. And we saw that, for instance, in the Flynn criminal investigation where -- Mary McCord: Right, that was criminal though, right, yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- where there was a plea and the court appointed someone essentially to represent the court’s interest in deciding whether essentially it was collusive between the department then run by Bill Barr and the defense. But again, there was an issue about limited authority. Mary McCord: And that’s actually under the federal rules, but you’re right. I mean, on most civil litigation, the court would not have a role unless it’s a class action. I kind of misspoke on that. Andrew Weissmann: And there’d be many ways also to get around it, essentially, because the issue is it’s very hard for the court to say, I’m forcing the Department of Justice to litigate -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- because the department could just be like, we’re getting rid of this case. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And especially if the case hasn’t yet been brought because of the timing that we talked about the six-month period, and it’s just a private settlement where it never is going to court at all. And there’s just a private agreement between the Department of Justice and a dismissal, you know -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- an agreement that this is binding that Donald Trump couldn’t now bring any more lawsuits and in exchange for which the department is going to pay X millions of dollars. It seems to me that you could have, you know, potentially Congress trying to do something, but I don’t think it would be the courts and the immunity decision, as you pointed out, would have important dicta because it came up in a criminal context, but it obviously has civil implications as well, given their reliance on a different Nixon decision in the civil context. Mary McCord: Yes, that’s right. Now, I could see a taxpayer lawsuit against the Department of Justice might get thrown out. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I mean, this is one where, Mark, this is just an excellent question, and it is fodder for one more reason why the criminal immunity decision is so bad. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And an example of what Joe Biden has said, which is in light of that immunity decision, who inhabits the Oval Office. Again, whether Republican or Democratic, regardless of party, the idea of self-restraint and public service is such an important component given how much power that person has. So excellent, excellent question. Mary McCord: All really great today. Thank you so much to our listeners. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, before I thank everyone, do you know what we’re on the cusp of? Mary McCord: I just learned what we’re on the cusp of. Andrew Weissmann: Me too. And the cusp is our next episode, we turn 100. Mary McCord: Oh my gosh, we do not turn 100. Andrew Weissmann: I feel 100. Mary McCord: It is our 100th episode. Andrew Weissmann: But you know what keeps me young? Talking to you, Mary. Mary McCord: Okay, me too. Andrew Weissmann: So, it’ll be our 100th episode. This is 99. Mary McCord: That’s really exciting. Andrew Weissmann: It’s been such a great ride. Mary McCord: It has been.

"Looking for cash, Trump combines two of his money-making schemes",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 9:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/looking-cash-trump-combines-two-money-making-schemes-rcna168626,"Shortly before Christmas 2022, Donald Trump raised a few eyebrows with an item published to his social media platform. “AMERICA NEEDS A SUPERHERO!” the former president wrote. “I will be making a MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT tomorrow. Thank you!” Ample speculation soon followed, but few guessed what the Republican would unveil a day later: The “official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection.” For “only” $99 each, his customers could buy non-fungible tokens, which the candidate described as “very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.” This was, to be sure, high on the list of Trump’s cringeworthy money-making schemes, alongside an unrelated pitch that came a year later when the former president sold off pieces of the suit he said he wore while taking his mug shot after one of his criminal indictments. This week, believe it or not, the GOP candidate managed to combine the two schemes. The Hill reported: Describing his latest money-making scheme in an online video, Trump said: “It’s really something” — a sentiment that was easy to agree with, though not for the reasons he had in mind. Part of what makes this striking is the degree to which Trump released a video of himself that made him look like a two-bit carnival huckster. Just as notably, I’ve never seen a candidate for the nation’s highest office do something like this during a presidential campaign. In fact, it’s important to emphasize that the Republican nominee isn’t doing this to get contributions, because the money apparently won’t benefit his 2024 operation. This is about Trump looking for money to put in his pocket, not his coffers. But let’s also not lose sight of the larger pattern. The gold sneakers. The Trump-endorsed Bible. The fake university. The board game. The steaks. We’re talking about a politician who appears to meander from one get-rich-quick opportunity to the next, without much regard for merit or dignity. It’s not a secret that the Republican’s finances are a mess, and a recent Washington Post analysis added, “He is in a cash crunch — personally and politically — and has been unafraid throughout his career to put the Trump name on anything that might yield a stream of revenue.” When it comes to someone seeking the White House, that’s ... not ideal."
What Jack Smith’s changes tell us about his Jan. 6 case against Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 9:38 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jack-smith-trump-indictment-changes-jan-6-supreme-court-rcna168525,"Just over a year ago, special counsel Jack Smith indicted former President Donald Trump over his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. There was a bit of déjà vu then on Tuesday when Smith revealed that he had obtained a superseding indictment against Trump, keeping the same four charges in place but with the backing of a different federal grand jury. When comparing the version that was handed up on Tuesday with the original from last year, the changes appear to be focused on deconflicting the charges against Trump with the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on the matter. Smith opted against the most cautious approach he could have taken, stripping the case down to its essence to fully bulletproof it from further Supreme Court intervention. Instead, he has chosen to attempt the strongest case available against Trump within the fetters that the court has now placed on him. The most obvious changes relate to the court’s sweeping decision in Trump v. United States. Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion found that all presidents, including Trump, have absolute immunity from criminal charges for exercising their “core Constitutional duties.” Roberts specifically cited Trump’s communications with the Justice Department — in which he tried to force the DOJ to back his false election claims — as off-limits for prosecution. Smith has complied accordingly, deleting the entirety of the DOJ evidence from the indictment’s narrative, along with any references to Justice Department officials pushing back on his lies about mass voter fraud. Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark is no longer an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator. Also gone are any references to the White House counsel and most references to any conversations Trump might have had with people on his staff within the executive branch. Beyond the absolute immunity for a president’s core duties, Roberts also ruled that there is “presumptive immunity” for things that fall within the scope of the president’s “remaining official actions.” It now falls to Smith to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan which of Trump’s actions were “unofficial” and thus beyond the reach of this presumed immunity — but he is blocked from being able to use “official acts” as evidence to make the case for why immunity should not be granted. The special counsel has accepted that challenge with gusto. In the new indictment, Smith carefully makes clear why many of the steps Trump and his allies took were in no way part of the president’s job. Nowhere is that more evident than when it comes to Trump’s pressure campaign against former Vice President Mike Pence. After numerous other avenues had failed, Trump leaned on Pence to simply declare him the winner when presiding over the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. The opinion in Trump v. U.S. hinted that those conversations between the president and vice president might fall within the scope of presumptive immunity, but Smith didn’t mince words in disagreeing: Moreover, Smith takes great pains to emphasize how many of the people acting on Trump’s behalf did so in the name of his presidential campaign, not his presidency. There are still six unindicted co-conspirators listed in the document, he writes, “none of whom were government officials during the conspiracies and all of whom were acting in a private capacity.” The new indictment also addresses the role of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has attempted to use his former position as cover from being investigated or indicted. Smith now clarifies that Meadows “sometimes handled private and Campaign-related logistics for the Defendant” when describing Trump’s now infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Interestingly, the new indictment’s edits also appear to consider a second Supreme Court ruling as well. A few days before the decision in Trump v. U.S., the court ruled in Fischer v. United States, which considered the Justice Department’s use of a federal statute on obstructing an official proceeding. Roughly a quarter of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged under Section 1512(c)(2) for their role in disrupting the counting of electoral votes, according to the Justice Department. There was concern when the case was being adjudicated that the court might entirely invalidate two of the four charges against Trump. The 6-3 decision did narrow the scope of the law in question but did so in a way that let the charges against the former president stand. Roberts, again the author of the majority opinion, wrote that prosecutors must now show that defendants “impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so.” In the new indictment, Smith’s team has done just that. When describing the actual events of the Jan. 6 attack, the new version adds in more details about Congress’ work that day to certify the Electoral College’s votes, focusing on the documents that the rioters threatened after breaching the Capitol. With that shift, the prosecution now also highlights the timing of the attack and its aim of disrupting the vote count. “At approximately 1:11 p.m., the Vice President opened the certificates of vote and certificates of ascertainment that the legitimate electors for the state of Arizona had mailed to Washington, consistent with the [Electoral Count Act],” the indictment now reads. Two paragraphs later, having noted that Trump was back in the White House watching events unfold, the prosecution describes the Capitol being breached and forcing the Senate to recess. “At approximately 2:20 p.m., the official proceeding having been interrupted, staffers evacuating from the Senate carried with them the electors’ certificates of vote and their governors’ certificates of ascertainment,” Smith wrote. The superseding indictment is not guaranteed to kickstart the trial, which was originally scheduled to begin this past March. There are still several elements that will require Chutkan to rule on whether they can be included in his arguments. Trump’s lawyers are most likely to object to the prosecution’s references to his conversations with Pence, arguing that those discussions were within the scope of his office. But they may wind up throwing whatever they can into their filing to attempt to delay the proceedings further. And, thanks to the vagueness of the immunity test that Roberts put forward, whatever ruling Chutkan makes will likely be appealed. The matter may even make its way back up to the Supreme Court, as I predicted previously, giving the conservative justices another chance to cover for Trump. But Smith has done a lot of the heavy lifting to ensure that, should Trump lose in November, this case can continue forward into the next administration."
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.28.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-82824-rcna168613,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the local mayoral race won’t be decided until the fall, but the two finalists for the office to emerge from this week’s primary are both Democrats, which means the party will flip the office from “red” to “blue.” * In Donald Trump’s latest interview with Phil McGraw (TV’s “Dr. Phil”), the former president said: “I guarantee you, if Jesus came down and was the vote counter, I would win California.” The GOP candidate lost the Golden State four years ago by roughly 29 points, and Republicans have presented no evidence of election irregularities in the state. * As debate negotiations continue, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said in a statement: “Both candidates have publicly made clear their willingness to debate with unmuted mics for the duration of the debate to fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates — but it appears Donald Trump is letting his handlers overrule him. Sad!” * In Ohio’s closely watched U.S. Senate race, Republican Bernie Moreno’s past as a car dealer has been mocked and scrutinized, but NBC News reports that he’s nevertheless returning to the industry. Despite claims that he’s sold off all of his companies, the GOP candidate is investing millions in two ventures that are developing a new car dealership. * Several Democratic strategists are launching a new super PAC focused specifically on “election protection and battles that could come after Election Day.” The effort will be called Democracy Defenders, and it’ll be led by Jim Messina, who was Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager. * Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign is over, but the independent conspiracy theorist ended his candidacy too late to be removed from ballots in some states, including Michigan and Wisconsin. * And a new $10 million ad campaign from Building America’s Future and Americans for Consumer Protection will apparently try to discourage Black voters from supporting Harris, who’d be the nation’s first Black woman to serve as president. The attack ads will reportedly focus on battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin."
The brutal reality of Trump's mass deportation plan needs to be discussed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mass-deportation-plan-rcna168431,"Donald Trump still loves a border wall, so much so that he’ll even do a photo-op in front of one built during his predecessor Barack Obama’s administration. But as a policy promise and a symbol of what can be expected from a future Trump presidency, the wall has been replaced in favor of a program of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. The organizers of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month even printed signs reading “MASS DEPORTATION NOW!” for delegates to wave with glee. The idea has an understandable if vulgar appeal: If people are here illegally, just make them leave. If that’s unpleasant for them, it’s no more than they deserve for violating immigration laws. But if we consider what would be involved in mass deportation, it becomes clear that Trump is promising something that’s shocking in its brutality, overwhelming in its logistical challenge and unprecedented — not only in American history, but in the history of the world.  On NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday, host Kristen Welker asked Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, about the millions of families of mixed status, in which at least one parent is undocumented but a spouse or a child is a legal resident or a citizen. Would families simply be broken up? After dodging the question a few times while claiming he was eager to answer it, Vance finally said, “I think you of course have a number of children who are currently living with drug cartel members, not actually their families.” That’s not exactly reassuring to those families that a Trump administration would treat them as something other than criminals. Asked the same question about family separation three days before, Trump said only, “We’ll work on that,” which means he hasn’t given it any thought. As for how the mass deportation of undocumented people would work, he offered a predictably simple-minded explanation: “We’ll work with locals — and they’re going to bring them to us — and we’ll get them over the border, and we’ll make arrangements with the countries, and the countries will accept them back, and if they don’t accept them back, we do no trade with those countries, and we charge them big tariffs.” Bada-bing, bada-boom. All taken care of.  When Trump talks about mass deportation, he speaks as if every undocumented immigrant’s name and address are on a list and law enforcement can just knock on their doors and politely remove them. But the reality is far different. The most widely accepted number for the undocumented population is 11 million, though that is an approximation (Trump and other Republicans claim it’s twice as high or more). How is the government going to find and remove 11 million people if it doesn’t know who they are? Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws within the interior of the country, made 416,000 arrests last year; the agency clearly doesn’t have anything near the resources to arrest 26 times as many people. In fact, according to FBI statistics, every law enforcement agency in America — every police department and sheriff’s department, every state police troop, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and so on — combine to make about 10 million arrests per year. So even if you recruited every law enforcement official in the country to this effort, you’d be doubling their workload, and they still wouldn’t reach every undocumented resident.  Trump says he wants to deploy the military to do the job. And how would that work? Would soldiers descend on states and cities with large immigrant populations and go house to house demanding that everyone show their papers? I can remember when Republicans were the ones warning about “jack-booted government thugs” deploying “Gestapo tactics.” They might show up at workplaces where they suspect significant numbers of undocumented people are working, but such raids are usually rare and planned far in advance. Once they line up, say, a hundred workers outside a factory, how would those workers prove their legal status? A birth certificate or a passport is necessary to prove citizenship, and how many people take one of those documents to work every day? Would the military just arrest everyone with an accent and sort them out later? Legal residents and U.S. citizens would inevitably be wrongly arrested in huge numbers before they could prove their status, if they ever did, in what would be unlikely to be a smoothly run operation (this is a Trump enterprise, don’t forget). And where would you put the millions who’d been rounded up while this process of figuring out who is and isn’t a legal resident played out? Ghoulish Trump adviser Stephen Miller envisions vast camps near the southern border; just imagine dumping people there by the hundreds of thousands at a time and what it would take to provide food, shelter and sanitation for them.   Immigrants, including those who are undocumented, live in almost every state, county and city in America. Arresting this many of them would be chaotic, terrifying and often violent. Think of how you’d react if someone busted into your house and tried to take members of your family away. Basic civil rights would be violated on a scale unprecedented in American history. About 120,000 Japanese Americans were placed in internment camps during World War II, a program we now properly regard as abominable, and that was about one-one hundredth of the size of what Trump proposes.  In fact, no country has ever removed 11 million people from within its territory; to find roundups on anything even approaching that scale, you have to look to the history of genocide in places such as Germany and Cambodia.  That’s not to mention the economic consequences of mass deportation. Like it or not, undocumented people not only do critical work in a variety of industries including farming, construction and food production; they also pay billions of dollars in taxes every year. As one recent review of economic literature on the subject concluded, mass deportation “would shrink the U.S. economy, cause American workers to lose jobs, reduce the wages of U.S. citizens, lose the taxes paid by deported unauthorized immigrants and worsen the finances of federal, state and local governments.” Trump’s mass deportation plan is his most consequential economic promise, far more than cutting taxes or increasing tariffs, and it would be an economic disaster.  Perhaps Trump’s mass deportation would be akin to his promise to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it: something that was never going to happen the way he described it but which thrilled his supporters all the same. They love to imagine Trump snapping his fingers like Thanos and making all the undocumented immigrants disappear, without muss or fuss. Yet for all his rancid white nationalism, Trump couldn’t make immigrants disappear, as hard as he tried. This is still a country where immigrants are an essential part of our economic and cultural life, just as they have always been. We can’t know whether Trump believes what he says, but his people are certainly acting like they’re serious. “Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” his former ICE director Tom Homan said in July. “They ain’t seen s--- yet. Wait until 2025.” Even if Trump can’t accomplish what he promises, he’s likely at the very least to attempt some form of it. And we all ought to be afraid."
Republicans' latest attack line against Tim Walz: His dog?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tim-walz-dog-scout-conspiracy-republicans-rcna168498,"Conservatives looking to damage Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz tried out a bizarre new attack by making wild claims about ... his dog Scout. The claim stems from a post on X with two images of Walz and a dog. Walz mentions Scout in both photos, though the dogs are different. But one of the images is from a 2022 outing at a park, where Walz is seen playing with other dogs, according to a video he posted on Instagram at the time. The original post appears to be an attempt at trolling by a Republican strategist based in Minnesota. But Republicans ran with it. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called Walz “an all-time legendary liar” in a now-deleted post on X. Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.'s fiancée, accused Walz of “lying about his dog.” Even Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri shared it. The disingenuous attack is part of the right's efforts to discredit the Minnesota governor, often by exaggerating or making false claims about what he's done. So far, the attacks that Republicans have leveled against Walz include: The sheer number of attacks shows that Walz's critics have not yet found an effective strategy for attacking him despite closely scrutinizing his record. Contrast that with the backlash that Donald Trump's running mate has faced. Sen. JD Vance's resurfaced remarks about “childless cat ladies"" went viral and sparked intense criticism, as did his foreword for a book by a major Project 2025 figure. More recently, his awkward attempt at making small talk with employees at a donut store has been mocked. The problem for Walz's critics is that most Americans genuinely like him, as opposed to how they feel about Vance."
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calls out immunity ruling as contrary to a system that 'treated everyone the same',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ketanji-brown-jackson-immunity-ruling-trump-rcna168578,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent in Trump v. United States called out clearly her Republican-appointed colleagues’ broad grant of criminal immunity to Donald Trump. So even though she didn’t offer an entirely new sentiment during a new television interview, it was nonetheless striking to see and hear the Supreme Court justice express displeasure with the July 1 ruling.  In an excerpted clip of that CBS interview posted on Tuesday, occasioned by Jackson’s forthcoming memoir, when asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell if she was concerned about broad immunity, the Joe Biden appointee replied: “I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same.”  Putting aside all sorts of problems in the criminal system having nothing to do with Trump — of which Jackson, a former public defender, is likely well-aware — her comments took on even greater significance in the context of special counsel Jack Smith’s filing a superseding indictment Tuesday in the federal election interference case. The new indictment, which seeks to comport with the Roberts Court’s new immunity test, served as its own reminder of how far the GOP-appointed majority has gone to help Trump. Jackson’s remarks underscore that reality.  The justice may have yet another opportunity to weigh in officially on the case. The high court sent it back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan and tasked the trial judge with applying the new, vague test to Trump’s prosecution. It’s unclear when or how Chutkan will rule, but the justices can review her work yet again before any trial can go forward. Such review is unlikely to occur before November’s presidential election, and as regular readers know, if Trump wins that election, he’ll find himself in the best circumstances possible for a criminal defendant: gaining the power to get rid of the case himself.

Vance’s rhetorical record on people without kids gets even worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-rhetorical-record-people-kids-worse-families-election-2024-rcna168597,"It’s been about six weeks since Donald Trump tapped Sen. JD Vance as his new running mate, and the rollout for the Ohio Republican hasn’t exactly been smooth. In fact, there’s quantifiable evidence that much of the public just doesn’t like the young senator — and his standing hasn’t improved since he became a candidate for national office. There are different explanations for Vance’s unpopularity, but it seems likely that his lengthy record of condemning Americans without children has contributed to his troubles. Unfortunately for the GOP ticket, that record is still growing. NBC News reported: “You know, so many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they’re people without kids, trying to brainwash the minds of our children,” Vance said at a forum in October 2021, about a year before he was elected to office for the first time. He added, in reference to the AFT leader, “If she wants to brainwash and destroy the mind of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.” Such ugly language would be controversial on its own, but it's made vastly worse by the totality of his record. As we’ve discussed, during Vance’s first campaign, the then-candidate appeared on Fox News and diagnosed what he saw as a crisis plaguing the United States. The country, Vance told a national television audience, was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It’s just a basic fact.” The future senator specifically included Vice President Kamala Harris — who has stepchildren, but no biological children of her own — in his societal condemnation. What’s more, CNN uncovered related comments from November 2020, when Vance said on a podcast that childless Americans, especially those in the country’s “leadership class,” were “more sociopathic” than those with children and made the country “less mentally stable.” The Republican went on to say that in his experience, the “most deranged” and “most psychotic” people he sees on social media were also typically childless. Alas, we can keep going. Media Matters, for example, uncovered several additional Fox interviews in which Vance lashed out at “childless” Democrats. Media Matters also found a Breitbart news interview in which the Ohioan claimed that the left’s “next generation leaders,” including “the Kamala Harrises, they don’t have kids. And so there’s this weird way where they want to take our kids and brainwash them so that their ideas continue to exist in the next generation.”  There’s also been extensive reporting of late about Vance suggesting that parents should have greater voting rights than Americans without children, and federal tax policies should “punish” those without children for their “bad” choices. Mother Jones’ David Corn, meanwhile, uncovered a speech in which Vance said he receives unflattering media coverage because he thinks most journalists are “childless adults.” HuffPost added a report of its own, shining a light on comments the Republican senator made in 2021 about the need to “go to war” against the idea that women can decide not to have children, suggesting that someone who focuses on building their career instead of making babies will be “a sad, lonely, pathetic person.” About a month ago, Trump told Fox News that he’d encourage voters concerned about Vance to “listen to his words.” The trouble, of course, is that whenever people do listen to Vance’s words, his problems get worse. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"The worst part of Trump’s reaction to new, superseding indictment",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/worst-part-trumps-reaction-new-superseding-indictment-rcna168587,"It was about a year ago when Donald Trump was initially indicted over his efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat. It’s a case that was delayed by a series of procedural appeals, culminating in a scandalous U.S. Supreme Court ruling that, to a radical degree, elevates the American presidency above the law. That ruling, of course, was issued by Republican-appointed justices last month. This month, as my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained, special counsel Jack Smith and his team decided it was time for a new indictment related to the same underlying crimes. In other words, the GOP nominee is still being charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, but the charges are now being presented in such a way as to accommodate the Republican-appointed justices’ opinion. “The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions,” the special counsel’s office said in the filing. For the most part, the criminal defendant responded as expected. Trump began, for example, by turning to his donors, seeking a reward for the grand jury’s findings. (The subject line in the appeal: “I was just indicted again!”) The Republican has long tested the “crime doesn’t pay” adage, and it was hardly surprising to see him do so again. Around the same time, the former president turned to his social media platform to issue a furious tirade about the charges, Smith, and the efforts to hold him accountable. Trump then issued another such statement. Then another. And then another. About an hour later, however, Trump rolled out a different kind of complaint. “It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election — but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote. “Voting starts on September 6th, therefore the DOJ has violated its own policy — Election Interference.” So, a couple of things. First, Election Day 2024 is 69 days away. Yes, some states allow early voting that will begin much sooner, but Trump’s attempted “gotcha” probably won’t amount to much. Indeed, as Lawfare's Anna Bower explained, prosecutors explained in a March court hearing that the judge that the “60-day rule” does not apply to cases like Trump’s ""that have already been charged and are now in the hands of the judicial system.""  Second, it’s kind of hilarious to see the Republican take a sudden interest in a DOJ rule he was eager to ignore four years ago. In October 2020 — 30 days before Election Day, with early voting already underway across much of the country — Trump publicly called on federal prosecutors to charge Joe Biden, accusing him of undefined crimes. In fact, on Oct. 7, 2020 — 31 days before Election Day — Politico published an especially memorable headline: “‘Where are all of the arrests?’: Trump demands Barr lock up his foes.” The next day, the then-Republican incumbent spoke with Fox Business and called on the Justice Department to “indict” his perceived Democratic foes — including Biden. In other words, when Smith’s office issues a superseding indictment 70 days before Election Day 2024, before early voting begins in any state, Trump sees it as proof of “election interference” and a violation of Justice Department policy. But when Trump was in office, he nevertheless expected the DOJ to charge his Democratic opponent with made-up crimes much closer to Election Day 2020. How does the former president explain the contradiction? So far, by ignoring it."

"Ahead of sentencing, Jan. 6 defendant leans on ‘Foxmania’ defense",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 8:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ahead-sentencing-jan-6-defendant-leans-foxmania-defense-rcna164683,"A man named David Brian Howard is poised to appear in court tomorrow, where he’ll likely become the latest Jan. 6 defendant to receive a criminal sentence. As part of his legal defense, however, Howard is blaming Fox News for having an unhealthy influence on his perspective. As The New Republic reported: If this sounds at all familiar, it’s probably because Howard isn’t the first Jan. 6 defendant to reference the controversial cable network as part of a legal defense. NBC News also reported on a different Jan. 6 defendant (who pleaded guilty) whose lawyer said ahead of sentencing that his client was infected with “Foxmania” from watching too much Fox News. “He became hooked with what I call ‘Foxitus’ or ‘Foxmania’ and became interested in the political aspect and started believing what was being fed to him,” the defense attorney said. We don’t yet know the extent to which this argument will matter — Antonio’s sentencing is still a few weeks away — and Howard will also soon learn whether the “Foxmania” defense works in his favor. Either way, Fox News executives probably aren’t pleased to see suspected Jan. 6 criminals blaming their network’s coverage for their misguided actions."
Why Trump’s new commitment to pardons for Jan. 6 rioters matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-commitment-pardons-jan-6-rioters-matters-rcna164670,"Donald Trump has spent much of the campaign season lying uncontrollably about the Jan. 6 attack he instigated, and at the former president’s latest rally in Pennsylvania, the Republican kept the assault on reality going. Trump repeated a familiar lie about Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, he lied again about his Jan. 6 crowd size, and he rewrote history by claiming that some of his followers “walked peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol.” As part of the same remarks, Trump also falsely accused members of the Jan. 6 committee of “deleting and destroying” evidence that would’ve made him appear innocent. But as exasperating as these false claims were, the more important rhetoric came a few hours earlier, during Trump’s disastrous appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists. The New York Times reported: As difficult as this might be to believe, ABC News anchor Rachel Scott reminded the Republican of the extensive injuries to police officers during the insurrectionist violence, including an officer who lost an eye. She asked whether the rioters who clashed with those officers are “patriots” who “deserve pardons.”Trump initially responded by ignoring the question and talking about protesters spray-painting limestone at the Capitol last week. So Scott tried again, asking whether he’s prepared to pardon “rioters who assaulted police officers.” The GOP nominee replied, “Oh, absolutely. If they’re innocent, I’d pardon them.” When Scott noted that they were talking about criminals who’ve already been convicted, Trump added that they were “convicted by a very, very tough system” — as if that somehow left open the possibility that the violent rioters, some of whom pleaded guilty, might still be innocent and deserving of presidential pardons.This was, as a Politico report noted, “the most explicit promise Trump has made about the range of defendants he might spring from prison if he takes office — a group that now appears to include some of the most notoriously violent actors that day.” Quite right. As regular readers might recall, it was in mid-March when the former president declared that pardoning “the January 6 Hostages,” whom he said were being “wrongfully imprisoned,” would be among his “first acts” upon returning to the White House. Less than a week later, Trump offered some additional clarity to his plan: Jan. 6 rioters could expect pardons on “the first day” of his second term. According to those on the former president’s team, Jan. 6 pardons would be considered on a case-by-case basis — the idea being that Trump would exercise at least some caution and wouldn’t simply pardon everyone convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol. But the presumptive GOP nominee himself apparently has a different perspective on this. When Trump sat down with Time magazine’s Eric Cortellessa in the spring, the reporter reminded him that more than 800 Jan. 6 participants have been sentenced through our judicial system and most of them pleaded guilty. Others were convicted by juries. “Will you consider pardoning every one of them?” Cortellessa asked. “I would consider that, yes,” Trump replied. Apparently surprised, the Time reporter added, “Really?” to which the Republican said, “Yes, absolutely.” (He went on to share some related and bizarre ideas about the police “ushering” rioters into the Capitol, and a nefarious “they” who “destroyed” evidence that would’ve made him look better.) As an NBC News report added soon after, Trump was referring to Jan. 6 defendants “caught on tape brandishing or using firearms, stun guns, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bike racks, batons, a metal whip, office furniture, pepper spray, bear spray, a tomahawk ax, a hatchet, a hockey stick, knuckle gloves, a baseball bat, a massive ‘Trump’ billboard, ‘Trump’ flags, a pitchfork, pieces of lumber, crutches and even an explosive device during the brutal attack that injured about 140 police officers.”It was two years ago when the Republican first broached this subject, telling a Tennessee audience that he would look “very, very seriously” at pardoning those who were arrested for Jan. 6 crimes. For emphasis, he added, “very, very seriously.” Twenty-five months later, his position on the rioters, whom he’s labeled “J-6 patriots,” is far more radical — to the point that Trump is now the first major-party presidential candidate in the history of American politics to run on a platform that effectively says, “Vote for me and I’ll deliberately release violent criminals back onto the streets.” As we’ve discussed, it’s also important to acknowledge the broader circumstances. In the weeks, months and years that followed the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, federal prosecutors got to work charging rioters, not just because they committed crimes, and not just to hold them accountable, but also to prevent future attacks. The message was intended to be clear: The United States prosecuted these insurrectionists, so those thinking about following in their footsteps should expect to face legal consequences, too. Trump intends to silence that message, undo what’s been done and make clear that criminals who ignore the law in his name need not worry about accountability. There is arguably no greater example of the Republican’s hostility toward the rule of law. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"As JD Vance flounders, Trump does surprisingly little to help",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 6:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-flounders-donald-trump-surprisingly-little-help-election-2024-rcna164655,"The Wall Street Journal asked Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer this week about Donald Trump choosing Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. “Well, it’s too late to rethink it,” the North Dakotan responded. It’s been that kind of rollout for the GOP’s vice-presidential nominee. “I’ll bet President Trump is sitting there scratching his head and wondering, 'why did I pick this guy?'” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CBS News a few days ago. “The choice may be one of the best things he ever did for Democrats.” Just as importantly, quite a few Republicans have also struggled to pretend that they’re satisfied with the former president’s current running mate. The larger question remains, however, what Trump thinks of his choice. As it turns out, Vance was a topic of conversation during the Republican’s disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists’ conference. USA Today reported: The line of inquiry couldn’t have been more straightforward. “When you look at JD Vance, is he ready on Day One?” Faulkner asked. What Trump should have said was, “Of course he is. I wouldn’t have chosen him for my ticket if I wasn’t certain he could assume the presidency in the event of a crisis.” But instead of saying that, Trump instead argued that his running mate just isn’t that important. “Historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” the former president said. “I mean, virtually no impact. ... Virtually never has it mattered.” Remember, the question was whether his running mate would be ready to lead in January. Instead of answering directly, Trump effectively said that his running mate just isn’t that important. As part of the same appearance, he was also asked about Vance’s contempt for American couples without children, and Trump didn’t exactly have compelling answers on this, either. It’s been difficult to keep up with the recent reporting featuring the words “Vance” and “buyers’ remorse,” which helps explain why the Ohio senator begins his national effort with a negative favorability rating — a rarity for any modern running mate. Trump’s latest comments almost certainly won’t help. Trump “has a choice,” Schumer added this past weekend. “Does he keep Vance on the ticket, where he already has a whole lot of baggage ... or does he pick someone new?” Such talk is almost certainly premature, though I have a hunch the New York Democrat won’t be the last prominent political figure to ask such a question."
"At NABJ event, Trump lights his outreach to Black voters on fire",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nabj-event-trump-lights-outreach-black-voters-fire-rcna164640,"It probably seemed like a good idea at the time. The National Association of Black Journalists extended an invitation to Donald Trump to appear at their convention, creating an opportunity for the organization to raise its visibility, and offering NABJ professionals an opportunity to hear directly from a man who might soon become president. The Republican nominee, meanwhile, accepted the invitation, hoping to reach an audience beyond his far-right base. What could possibly go wrong? Before the former president even took the stage, problems emerged. As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones explained, “The organization faced a deluge of denunciations from journalists and activists after it announced it would give a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the free press, spread racist propaganda and repeatedly insulted Black journalists. In fact, NABJ has issued several statements in recent years denouncing Trump’s illiberal behavior and attacks on its members.” But after the GOP nominee actually started speaking, Trump not only made matters far worse, he also validated the concerns of those who warned the NABJ that it was making a mistake by giving him a platform in the first place. NBC News reported: To be sure, Trump’s appearance at the convention was a train wreck for a variety of reasons. His rhetoric about “Black jobs,” for example, was a mess. He similarly went out of his way to be as insulting and condescending as possible to some of the Black women who asked him good and fair questions. As is usually the case, he also lied — a lot — about matters large and small. But it was Trump’s comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity that were jaw-dropping. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic vice president. “And she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the Republican added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded, “Is she Indian or is she Black?” The unscripted comments were obviously racist. They were also sadly predictable given Trump’s lengthy record of overt racism. What's more, as a New York Times analysis added, “The audacity of Mr. Trump, a white man, questioning how much a Black woman truly belongs to Black America was particularly incendiary. ... [I]t evoked an ugly history in this country, in which white America has often declared the racial categories that define citizens, and sought to determine who gets to call themselves what.” The idea that Harris — who is both Indian American and Black — could have a multifaceted racial and ethnic background is apparently intolerable to the Republican candidate. Trump expects voters to believe that the vice president “happened to turn Black,” which is every bit as wrong and offensive as it seems. Team Trump developed a plan to go after the likely Democratic nominee. Having Trump question Harris’ identity, while insisting that she “obviously” doesn’t “respect” her Indian and Black heritage, was not part of that plan. Indeed, it didn’t come as too big of a surprise when the former president’s aides pulled the plug on the appearance and Trump left the stage before the end of his scheduled appearance — though he continued to go after Harris’ identity in the hours that followed the event. In a normal and healthy political environment, in a normal and healthy political party, this was the sort of appearance that might very well end a candidacy. The larger question isn’t whether Trump is relying on racism — again — to advance his quest for power, because the answer is obvious. Rather, the question is why in the world would he put on this racist display while appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention. Let’s not forget that for much of the year, the Republican and his team seemed determined to improve their showing with Black voters. What’s more, there was some polling evidence that suggested those efforts were paying off, and Trump was poised to fare better in communities of color in 2024 than any other modern GOP nominee. But if that was a priority for Team Trump when it was facing President Joe Biden, it’s no longer a priority now. What the public saw at Wednesday’s event was a candidate who had a plan for reaching out to Black voters, and then set that plan on fire. In fact, it’s easy to believe that those in attendance at the NABJ event were not the intended audience at all. As The Washington Post’s Colbert I. King summarized in his latest column, “As offensive as all that was to the Black men and women staring in his direction, Trump knew it was getting a belly laugh with his crowd, who can’t get enough of that stuff.” Common sense suggests Trump did not earn any support on Wednesday from communities of color, but by all appearances, they weren’t the intended audience for his offensive antics."
Brooke Shields on why she is in the most ‘exciting’ stage of her career yet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/brooke-shields-exciting-stage-career-yet-rcna164095,"Actress and model Brooke Shields has been working since she was 11 months old. But at age 59, she says she is in the most “challenging and exciting” stage of her career yet. “I think what’s exciting about it is it’s so unknown,” she told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. Shields was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list, which was revealed on Thursday. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. Shields recently founded Commence, a New York-based hair care company, for women over the age of 40. And earlier this year, Shields was elected president of the Actors Equity Association, a union representing approximately 51,000 actors and stage managers in the United States. Shields said she came up with the idea for Commence during the pandemic when she was having conversations online with women over the age of 40. “I wanted to hear what women my age were really experiencing, what they were feeling … how they felt they were being represented… And inevitably, all of them started saying how upset they were … that there was this feeling that once you hit a certain age, that all of a sudden, you lose all your value,” said Shields. She noted that the marketing is geared to very young women “and then you’re sort of put into this world where you’re in Depends, dentures… There is a whole bracket in the middle.” Commence is still in its early days. According to Forbes, Shields has raised $3.5 million from outside investors to help fund the company’s first three products, which were released in June. But she is on a mission to make women feel extraordinary. “We have experience. We have years, we’ve gone through so much, many of us have raised children… or started companies… There should be no reason why we are discounted,” she said. McGrath recounted a time when Shields was in her 20s and being interviewed by a man who asked her if it ever worried her that her career had peaked already. “I remember actually feeling bad for the person,” Shields recounted. “Because it seemed like such a ridiculous thing to ask … I remember thinking, ‘Oh, that seems like a waste of a question because I’m just beginning…’” McGrath asked how Shields would answer that question today.  “I’m going to forever peak … Why should there be one peak? Why does everything then have to mean you’re going downhill… And yes, the world is set up to want to champion youth …and that is great. I’m not occupying that stage right now, but I am occupying an equally exciting, perhaps more empowered stage because I have excitement, belief, energy, and experience of all things … I now come at things with such a different level of belief in myself and a fight. I’m not knocked over easily anymore. So, I would say that I will keep peaking.”"
How a career pivot at age 32 led Ava DuVernay to become the first Black woman to direct a $100M film,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/career-pivot-age-32-led-ava-duvernay-become-first-black-woman-direct-1-rcna164496,"There’s no doubt that Ava DuVernay has shaken up the film industry. She was the first Black woman to win the directing award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012, to be nominated for Best Director for a Golden Globe, to have her film (“Selma”) nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and to direct a $100-million-grossing movie (“A Wrinkle in Time""). However, DuVernay didn’t pick up a camera until 2005 when she was 32 years old. Until that point, she had been working in public relations. DuVernay, who was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list, said one takeaway from her journey is that it’s never too late to make a change. “You decide when it’s too late,” the 51-year-old told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. “You decide when you don’t want to try anymore and when you’re gonna lean in a little bit… You are the director of your life… You decide how far you can go, no one else does.” DuVernay recounted being a publicist in her 30s promoting films and television shows. She loved it, but while on set started to think about how she would tell the story. “I was wishing that I was directing. And one day I thought, ‘Well, why don’t I try’?” said DuVernay, who quit her job that day. She noted, however that “one of the things that I tell people when they’re looking to make a change or pursue something new is, let it be, do it slowly… I was a weekend warrior. I was writing scripts on weekends… I was taking time, you know, before work, after work, to read, to take classes, and to slowly make my way towards the dream… The best part is the journey.” She also spoke about one of her latest projects, “Origin,” which is streaming on Hulu. The film is based on the life of writer Isabel Wilkerson (played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), who explores how the caste system can help us better understand what Black people experience in America. DuVernay said it was important for her to produce and release the movie before the 2024 election. “I won’t say that I’m looking at have, you know, an impact in terms of the outcome of the election, I just want people to be a lot more rigorous,” she said. “I want to see more rigor in our conversations around the things that matter.” She continued: “I feel a general fatigue, I feel like people are exhausted. With the onslaught of news, with the onslaught of misinformation with kind of the tribalism, you’re on this side, I’m on this side… I think there’s a laziness, sometimes an apathy, folks really feeling very, very singular and kind of closed off in the way that they want to think… So the goal was for the film is to just kind of awaken get us to see one another in a different way. And hopefully that contributes to different conversations and more healthy outcomes.”  "
Legendary basketball coach Dawn Staley: ‘Ask for what you’re worth’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/legendary-basketball-coach-dawn-staley-ask-re-rcna164478,"Some research suggests that women are more likely to shy away from negotiating their salaries in comparison to men. That doesn’t include Dawn Staley. In 2021, Staley became one of the highest-paid coaches in women’s college basketball when she signed a $22.4 million, seven-year contract. During the negotiation process, the 54-year-old head coach of University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball, said she wasn’t afraid to “strike when the iron is hot.” “I probably looked at my male counterpart at the time and saw that his raises were much more than my raises and his success didn’t match our success,” Staley told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath.  “So I thought it was a great opportunity for me to just speak on that… When you bet on yourself, when you utilize the perseverance that it took to get you to that status, it’s the same kind of gall it takes to go in there ask for what you’re worth… You’re asking for what you deserve. Don’t be afraid to go in and do that.” Staley was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list, which was revealed on Thursday. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. Staley, an Olympic gold medalist and Hall of Fame point guard herself, led the South Carolina Gamecocks to NCAA Championship titles in 2022 and 2024. This year, her team was undefeated and the NCAA women’s championship game between Iowa and South Carolina drew in a record 18.7 million viewers. “What I make of the movement of women’s basketball is this. I do believe we’ve been held back for a very long time. And now … we’re trying to get to the top and get as many eyeballs on our game and people are clamoring. They’re clamoring to watch,” said Staley. ""They’re clamoring to be in attendance. They’re buying … record amounts of apparel and clothing. I just think it’s been on the rise for so long. Now, it's uncontrollable. I think we’re in a great place where people are really looking at us as a sport.” McGrath asked Staley if she viewed being over 50 as an advantage or disadvantage in her line of work. “Being over 50 is the most liberating,” said Staley. “Like seriously, I know myself. Like being 50, you’re more lean in life. You know what you like. You know what you don’t like. And I know a lot of people will look at me and say ‘I can’t believe she’s over 50.’ I don’t always act like I’m over 50. I act age-appropriate when necessary, but when I’m with my players, I feel in my 30s.”"
Mika: Kamala Harris is our 'best hope of saving health care for women in America',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/mika-kamala-harris-best-hope-saving-healthcare-women-america-rcna164562,"As we launch ""Know Your Value"" and Forbes’ fourth annual ""50 Over 50"" U.S. list (which may be our most impressive one yet), I think it’s important to note that our headliner for the very first list four years ago was Vice President Kamala Harris. And today, Harris at 59 years old is seen as the young, fresh face of presidential politics. Isn’t life sweet? When I first launched this list, I thought I would be paving the way for women in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and well beyond to validate their place, role and impact in today’s society. What I discovered is that we are catching up with a well-established successful global movement. Women over 50 are thriving, impactful, paving a long runway for the next generation. And now our young “50 Over 50” listee is leading the way for women at a time in U.S. politics when our health is at stake — literally. Vice President Kamala Harris is an internet sensation and has turned the race around breaking fundraising records in just one week. For women, her breakout campaign is just in time.  There is already so much suffering at the hands of Trump Republicans. There are women across the country who need abortion health care to either survive, be able to have babies again, or to save themselves and their families from trauma who are left with no options. Take Samantha Casiano, of East Texas, who found out at her 20-week ultrasound that her baby had a rare and fatal condition that prevented the skull and brain from fully forming. She was told her baby was going to die — but abortion laws in the state forced her to give birth anyway. Four hours after giving birth, Casiano’s daughter, Halo Hope, died in her arms. Or what about Deborah Dobert in Florida, who was forced to carry her son, Milo, to term — even though he had no kidneys and would die soon after birth. Not only did Milo die, doctors told Dobert that her pregnancy put her at high risk of preeclampsia, which can be fatal. And what about Christina Zielke, who was in Ohio when she started to miscarry. Because of the state’s six-week abortion ban, the ER wouldn’t treat her miscarriage even though she was bleeding profusely. Can you imagine “passing blood clots the size of golf balls” and being told by the hospital that it needed proof there was no fetal development and to come back in two days? It is as if we are living in the dark ages. So Kamala Harris is our first best hope of saving health care for women in America. It took just one generation for Harris (the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants) to reach the highest levels of government and to make history in America as the first Black, Asian and female candidate to lead a major party’s ticket. And that, my friends, is what America is all about. The excitement we are seeing and feeling about Harris is because she channels all of our dreams about this country — that literally anything is possible. And it comes at a time when the Republican nominee and his misogynistic running mate are campaigning on what is not possible.  They’re against abortion health care. They’re against a deal on immigration unless it serves them politically. They’re against saving Ukraine — and therefore peace in the world. They are against commonsense, gun safety measures. The list goes on and on. The emergence of Harris on the presidential campaign stage feels like the sun coming out after a long, dark storm. And it is so wonderful to be releasing a list that celebrates women at their most powerful stage in life, where their wisdom and life experience come together as they firmly reject the notion that their best years are behind them. And I simply think it’s absolutely amazing that Harris is the fresh, young face poised to fight for our freedoms and our future."
"Mika: With $15 trillion in spending power and decades of wisdom, women over 50 are THE incredible untapped resource",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/business-culture/mika-15-trillion-spending-power-decades-wisdom-women-50-are-incredible-rcna164072,"In 2021, when Know Your Value partnered with Forbes to publish our first ever ""50 Over 50"" list, Vice President Kamala Harris, television producer and screenwriter Shonda Rhimes, founder Julie Wainwright and investor Cathie Wood headlined the inaugural edition.    To our delight, we discovered that some wannabe listers’ applications were rejected … because they were too young! Imagine that.   Today, Harris is a candidate for president (and is seen as the “younger” contender!) and Forbes and Know Your Value’s ""50 Over 50"" list has since become a global success and a cross-cultural, multigenerational movement.  We know the importance of spotlighting women around the world who are reshaping the image of life and work for women in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond. The lists shatter stereotypes and paves the long runway for the next generation of women leaders, firmly rejecting the notion that our best years are behind us.  Today as we release our fourth annual ""50 Over 50"" U.S. list, we are celebrating groundbreakers in biotech, education, retail, architecture and beyond. And even singers and activists who are releasing new albums in their mid-80s (we’re looking at you, Mavis Staples!) We have arrived — and then some. This year’s list may be our most impressive yet.  It includes actress Brooke Shields, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and basketball coach Dawn Staley — just to name a few. Our oldest honoree, activist and philanthropist Deborah Szekely, is proving it’s never too late to make an impact, even at the age of 102. Another favorite: Hollywood starlet June Squibb, whose acting career took off after the age of 80! At 94, Squibb still performs her own stunts — as we saw in her new film “Thelma”— when she hilariously runs off with an adult scooter at a senior home. She is a shining example of how age does not mean limitation or irrelevance. Also on the list: 67-year-old Valerie Jarrett, who served as senior advisor to President Obama from 2009 to 2017, making her the longest serving senior advisor to a president in history. Jarrett, who is now the CEO of the Obama Foundation, was nominated for our list by her daughter, Laura Jarrett, co-anchor of the Saturday TODAY show.  Women over 50 have made so much headway this year — whether it be in politics, the sciences, arts and entertainment. Female CEOs are now out earning their male counterparts. Women over the age of 50 account for 27 percent of all consumer spending. Forbes calls us “super consumers” because — with more than $15 trillion in purchasing power — we are the wealthiest and most active generation in history. Just look at this year’s Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition, which featured 69-year-old journalist Gayle King. She follows Martha Stewart, who last year at 81 became the oldest woman to appear on the magazine’s iconic cover. Stewart was also featured in this year’s issue, alongside Christie Brinkley, 70; Molly Sims, 51; Roshumba Williams, 55; and Paulina Porizkova, 59 (someone who was also a guest speaker at our inaugural 30/50 Summit!).  Businesses are starting to think more about the consumer segment that is women over the age of 50. QVC recently launched their standout campaign, “The Age of Possibility,” aimed at women over 50. Brooke Shield’s new business, Commence, is specifically building products for women in their 40s, 50s and beyond. Forbes Over 50 alumna Bobbi Brown frequently features women in their 50s and 60s in the advertising for Jones Road Beauty. Women over 50 are not mere observers of life’s rich pageant; we are leading the way. I created the ""50 Over 50"" list in part for women who are in their 20s and 30s, to prove to them they will have more opportunity and more time than they ever imagined. To show them that it’s OK to take your time, to make mistakes, to be comfortable pressing reset, pivot careers, and yes, start over. What I did not expect was this movement’s staggering success. I thought I was creating a place for women to slowly step into.  Instead, we are racing to keep up with the surging numbers of incredibly successful women in this age group. This is  a life-changing message for younger women. They can take that ticking clock that always made them feel like they were falling behind, and smash it into a million pieces. I am profoundly grateful for the women of the ""50 Over 50,"" and the work they are each accomplishing. This year’s list is just more proof that the sky’s the limit for us… And perhaps next year we will see one of our honorees as president of the United States? For now, let’s get ready to meet in New York and then dance together in the desert in Abu Dhabi. See you there!  "

And the women on this year’s “50 Over 50” U.S. list prove it. On Thursday, Forbes and Know Your Value released its fourth annual list, which spotlights women who have rejected the conventional wisdom that their best years are behind them. The women on this year’s list come from dozens of industries, including biotech, education, retail, architecture and beyond. The honorees achieved their greatest accomplishments and are making their biggest impact after the age of 50. “From filmmaker Ava DuVernay at 51, to former presidential advisor Valerie Jarrett at 67, to Michele Kang, a 65-year-old businesswoman and sports team owner, to actress June Squibb at 94 years young, this year’s list may be our most impressive yet,” said Know Your Value founder and “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski. Whittling down the honorees was a months-long process. Forbes and Know Your Value vetted thousands of nominees. Semifinalists were then reviewed by expert judges – a panel of alumnae that included entrepreneurs Suze Orman and Laura Geller, venture capitalist Theresia Gouw, and AnitaB.org president Brenda Darden Wilkerson – followed by more debate and research. The list is broken up into four categories: Impact, Investment, Innovation and Lifestyle, with 50 women on each list. Entrepreneurship was a major theme this year, noted Maggie McGrath, editor of ForbesWomen. “We have 75 or so women who have either founded or own their company who are on this year’s list. And a lot of them got them the entrepreneurial bug over the age of 50.” That includes 57-year-old Diana Levy, a stay-at-home mom for over 20 years, who founded Undercover Snacks after two of her daughters were diagnosed with Celiac disease. It’s now sold in 25,000 stores across the U.S. and on United Airlines flights. A number of women in politics and policy also made the list. That includes Jarrett, who at 52 years old became advisor to then-President Obama in 2009. She became the longest senior advisor to a president in history. And in October 2020, at the age of 63, Jarrett accepted a new job from Obama as director of the Obama Foundation. The following year, she became CEO. Jarrett first stepped into the White House as an advisor to President Obama in January 2009, she was 52 years old. Known as “the other side of Barack Obama’s brain,” she was the longest-serving senior advisor to a president in history. While in the West Wing, Jarrett oversaw the Offices of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs and chaired the White House Council on Women and Girls. In October 2020, at age 63, Jarrett accepted a new job from Obama as director of the Chicago-based Obama Foundation; the following year, she became CEO.  Also on the list is 70-year-old Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Sen. John McCain. In 2023, she was appointed executive director of the United Nations’ World Food Programme, which provides food to vulnerable populations, including those displaced by war, famine and natural disaster. “She is just an extraordinary humanitarian leader and activist,” said Huma Abedin, an MSNBC contributor and vice-chair of Forbes and Know Your Value’s 30/50 summit. Other notable listmakers included: ·      Dawn Staley, 54, Head Coach, University of South Carolina Women’s Basketball ·      Miriam Rivera, 60, Cofounder, CEO, Ulu Ventures ·      Peggy Johnson, 62, CEO, Agility Robotics ·      Brooke Shields, 59, Actress, Founder, CEO, Commence ·      Cecile Richards, 67,  Cofounder, Charley  ·      Julia Louis-Dreyfus, 63, Actor; Host, Wiser Than Me Podcast   ·      Anna Wintour, 74, Global Chief Content Officer, Conde Nast; Editor-in-Chief, Vogue ·      Danielle Steel, 76, Author ·      Patti Smith, 77,  Author, Artist ·      Val Ackerman, 64,  Commissioner, Big East Conference  ·      Akiko Iwasaki, 53, Professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute ·      Marlena Fejzo, 56, scientist, University of Southern California; Chief Scientific Officer, Harmonia Health ·      LaTosha Brown, 53, Cofounder, Black Voters Matter Brzezinski said one of the biggest lessons young women can learn from this year’s honorees is that they have time to figure out what they want to do in life. “Living longer, living better and having success later in life, it’s the long runway,” said Brzezinski. So younger women can calm down, take a couple of detours in life, do some different things. It is OK. there’s not rush anymore.”  Check out the full list here."
Trump gave another reason why he’s too old to run for president,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-too-old-president-age-harris-nabj-rcna164613,"In a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken after the presidential debate in June, 86% of Americans said President Joe Biden was too old to serve a second term. This survey and similar findings played an essential role in Biden’s decision to depart the presidential race, directly rebutting the president’s contention that only donors and media elites wanted him not to run. Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum since entering the race, while running on a platform almost identical to Biden’s, has only confirmed the depth of voters’ concerns about the president’s age. And yet since Biden dropped out, it has been largely forgotten that many voters are also rightly concerned about Donald Trump’s age. In the same Post/ABC poll, 60% of Americans, including 65% of independents, said Trump is too old for another term. But apart from a few initial articles and some jabs on social media, the question of Trump’s age has largely been forgotten. To be sure, Harris’ campaign is busy introducing her to voters. And in the wake of Trump’s naming JD Vance as his running mate, Democrats have delighted in pointing out that the MAGA movement’s leaders are somewhere between weird and straight-up creepy. But there’s still nearly 100 days left until Election Day — plenty of time to return to the issue. Even if some media outlets seem curiously incurious about age since Biden stepped aside, Trump’s age remains a serious issue. Should the 78-year-old Trump win in November, he would be older upon taking office than Biden was when he took office in 2021. Trump has a history of heart disease yet habitually releases medical records lacking any useful details. His personal physician when he first ran for president later admitted Trump outright dictated the memo declaring that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” In 2020, he and his team hid the seriousness of his Covid infection from the public. His assurances of his cognitive and physical health amount to “trust me.” Four years in the White House did not age Trump as much as other presidents — perhaps because he spent less scheduled time working than any other president. But time comes for everyone, and Trump is no exception. Even a cursory contrast between Trump’s first and third runs for the presidency shows him clearly diminished from his initial campaign. His tendency to ramble has only grown, and the confident bluster of 2016 has given way to exhaustion. He loses track of his thoughts mid-sentence or even mid-word. He asks his supporters to vote 24 hours after asking them not to vote. He mixes up names with increasing frequency, confusing Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley and Biden with Barack Obama. He even struggled to keep his eyes open at his Manhattan criminal trial this year. And Trump’s own staff knows his struggles. Just as Biden’s staff increasingly limited the president’s media and public appearances until June’s debate left it with no choice, so has Trump’s staff largely kept him confined to friendly venues. In his first two runs for the presidency, Trump frequently sat down with a wide range of media. This time around, he has stuck largely to Fox News and other such outlets. Trump’s disastrous appearance Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention showed exactly why his staff has built that bubble. Afterwards, at a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., Trump tried a new way to parse the issue. “81 is not old,” he insisted. “But [Biden] is a bad 81.” (In the same rally, he referred to Senate candidate Dave McCormick as Pennsylvania’s “future governor.”) The former president’s new excuse is further confirmation that voters’ concerns about Trump’s age should not be forgotten. Yes, if Democrats bring it up, they will be accused of being hypocrites after having long rejected calls for Biden to step aside. But in the end, they acceded to voters’ wishes — and reality. The concern about Trump’s age is no less legitimate. The presidency is an incredibly difficult job, requiring long hours, quick decisions and extraordinary focus. Those requirements have not changed since Biden dropped out."
JD Vance’s policies for parents are even more sinister beneath the surface,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vances-childless-cat-lady-comment-isnt-even-worst-rcna164288,"If Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, were merely a “pro-family” politician, no one would bat an eye. Helping parents with the difficult and important work of raising children is a bipartisan goal, even if Democrats and Republicans may disagree on how best to do it. But as usual, Donald Trump’s running mate couldn’t help himself. By now most people have heard about Vance’s attack on “childless cat ladies.” It wasn’t a stray remark; Vance has repeatedly expressed his disdain for those “childless sociopaths,” whom he argues “don’t have a direct stake” in our country. But it isn’t just rhetoric: Vance has proposed sweeping policy changes to the political and economic status of parents and nonparents. Taken together, they reveal a particularly selfish perspective on politics, as though we all view policy choices only through our narrow self-interest. Begin with taxes. “If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year,” Vance said in a 2021 interview, “and you’ve got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don’t have any kids. It’s that simple.” The first problem here is that households with children already pay lower taxes than people without them. For instance, look at the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income workers. In 2023, a married couple with no children could only get a credit if their income was lower than $24,210. A couple with two children was eligible if their income was up to $59,478. The credit itself was worth only $600 to childless couples, but up to $6,600 for those with three children — a full 11 times as much. That’s just one tax credit; parents also get personal exemptions for children, the child tax credit, deductions for child care and many more. If Vance wants to enhance those features of the tax code, he’ll get lots of agreement from Democrats, who are also eager to expand the affordability of child care, give kids free lunch in schools and pass many other pro-family policies. This week, in fact, Senate Democrats are moving ahead with a House bill — backed by nearly 170 Republicans — that would expand the child tax credit. But rather than prove his pro-family bona fides, Vance is expected to skip the vote. The trouble is that Vance presents more tax breaks for parents not as a way to help people who need it, but a moral judgment in favor of the very act of becoming a parent — and a punishment for those who can’t have children, haven’t had them yet, or have decided not to. We should “reward the things that we think are good,” he said in that 2021 interview, and “punish the things that we think are bad.” His views on taxes are just one indication of Vance’s perspective. “When you go to the polls in this country, you should have more power — more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic — than people who don’t have kids,” he said in a 2021 speech. “If you don’t have much of an investment in the future of this country, then maybe you shouldn’t get nearly the same voice.” This idea is not just an affront to one-person-one-vote democracy, it’s a remarkably selfish conception of what democracy actually entails. When we vote on which direction our nation should go, we aren’t just trying to maximize returns on our “investment.” We’re citizens, which means we deliberate and act together to obtain prosperity, peace, justice, and all the other values we want to pursue. We ask not just “What kind of country is good for me?” but “What kind of country is good?” Similarly, when it comes to the taxes we pay, we aren’t homo economicus, only pursuing our individual self-interest. There are tens of millions of taxpayers — both those without children and those whose children have grown — who pay property taxes knowing that they support local schools, despite not having children enrolled in them. People who don’t have cars pay taxes that are used to build roads and bridges — and those who use cars pay taxes to support public transit. Young people pay payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare for their elders. We fund research to find cures for diseases most of us will never contract, to aid suffering people in foreign countries, and to provide broadband to communities where we’ll never live.  Despite what people like Vance would have us believe, we all understand intuitively that we do this because we value each other and the future, whether we have children or not. When you learn that Dolly Parton has given away over 200 million books to kids, you don’t say, “What’s wrong with her? She doesn’t have any children, why should she care about anybody else’s?”  If you said that, you’d be some kind of weirdo. Or maybe the next vice president."
Why Trump’s ‘incident’ at Arlington National Cemetery matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 6:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-incident-arlington-national-cemetery-matters-rcna168577,"In modern American politics, the vast majority of officials in both parties have taken care to treat the military, service members and veterans with respect. Donald Trump, for reasons that defy comprehension, has chosen a radically different path. Over the last decade or so, the Republican has reportedly denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers.” (He denies doing so.) Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, reportedly disparaged wounded veterans, blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, downplayed the importance of traumatic brain injuries suffered by soldiers, feuded with Gold Star families, downplayed the significance of the Medal of Honor, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, “I like people that weren’t captured, okay?” But a different aspect of his disrespect for those who wear the uniform was on display this week. Despite his record, the former president, seeing a possible campaign opportunity, appeared eager on Monday to exploit the third anniversary of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghans. This included attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, quickly followed by a thumbs-up photo-op at a gravestone in Section 60 of the cemetery, where many service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. If we were to stop the story here, it would already be the basis for a legitimate controversy. Indeed, Esquire published a memorable headline alongside a Charles P. Pierce column this week: “How The Hell Was Trump Allowed To Use Arlington National Cemetery As A Campaign Prop?” But that was before the story managed to get even worse. NBC News reported: The details of what transpired are still coming together. NPR reported, for example, that a source familiar said two members of Trump’s campaign staff “had a verbal and physical altercation” with an official at Arlington National Cemetery, but that hasn't been independently confirmed by MSNBC or NBC News. Other relevant details, however, are clear. “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,” the statement added. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.” I’m mindful of the fact that multiple reports emphasized that Trump was at the cemetery at the invitation of some family members who lost loved ones in Afghanistan three years ago. That’s apparently true. But while those family members deserve respect and sympathy, politicians still aren’t supposed to exploit Arlington to advance their personal ambitions. For its part, Trump communications director Steven Cheung denied any wrongdoing and accused an Arlington National Cemetery official of “suffering from a mental health episode” during the incident. Cheung didn’t deny that the former president was accompanied by a photographer at Section 60, but he insisted the photographer was allowed to be there. Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita added that the cemetery official was “despicable.” I don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this story, but as it progresses, it’s hard not to wonder what the political world’s reaction might be if a Democratic candidate were caught up in a similar controversy. How many GOP officeholders would call for him or her to quit the race?"
Jack Smith’s targeted indictment faces a bigger test than immunity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 6:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-trump-superseding-indictment-supreme-court-immunity-rcna168567,"We may never learn if special counsel Jack Smith’s new indictment passes the Supreme Court’s immunity test. If Donald Trump wins a second term in November, he’ll be empowered to end the prosecution that accuses him of breaking the law in trying to overthrow the last election. The superseding indictment filed Tuesday more closely conforms to the Republican-appointed majority’s broad grant of presidential immunity last month, which didn’t exist when the special counsel initially brought the case last year. But while the new indictment puts Smith in a better position to take Trump to trial, the biggest obstacle the government faces isn’t a legal one but the political question of whether Trump will take office again, which would put him in position to thwart the case. But even if Trump loses, the Supreme Court could still decide that Smith’s new indictment doesn’t meet its recently created test. The next major step is for U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to apply the vague immunity test to the new indictment. It’s unclear what precise form that analysis will take — including whether there will be a hearing in addition to written arguments, or what such a hearing would entail. Before the superseding indictment issued Tuesday, Chutkan had set a Friday deadline to hear from the parties about how they want to proceed, and she had set a Sept. 5 status conference to discuss the case. A court filing from Smith accompanying the new indictment said that “the Government will confer with the defense and make a joint proposal, to the extent possible, regarding pretrial litigation in the status report due Friday.” Like any defendant, Trump needs to be arraigned on the superseding indictment, though whenever that happens, he would not necessarily have to appear in court for it. (He has, of course, pleaded not guilty, which is why the case is still proceeding.)  But even if Chutkan rules on the immunity test’s application to Trump’s new indictment before November — a complex task, to be sure — the Supreme Court can still have the last word on whether it thinks the trial judge correctly applied its vague test. The justices weren’t in a rush to decide the initial immunity appeal; don’t expect them to speed up any review as the election nears.  The new indictment can’t overshadow the reality that a Trump victory in November could moot the issue, legally. If elected, Trump could try a legally untested self-pardon or just order his newly installed attorney general to dismantle the case. The Justice Department also has a policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. (Presidents can’t pardon or dismiss state cases, however.) It’s an open question whether the Supreme Court would agree that Smith’s more-targeted indictment passes its immunity precedent, as well as the high court’s other recent Jan. 6 decision, Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants. Trump still faces the same four charges in the new indictment, including two obstruction-related counts. In a footnote in the immunity ruling, which came out after Fischer, Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion said, referring to the relevant obstruction statute: “If necessary, the District Court should determine in the first instance whether the Section 1512(c)(2) charges may proceed in light of our decision in Fischer.”  But we’ll only learn the answer to that question if Trump loses.

"Trump claims he’s agreed to debate Harris, but there’s a catch",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 5:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-agreed-debate-kamala-harris-election-campaign-2024-rcna168568,"Following a mind-numbing process, featuring multiple reversals, Donald Trump issued an unexpected announcement by way of his social media platform: The on-again, off-again ABC News debate against Vice President Kamala Harris is back on again. “I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a Debate with Comrade Kamala Harris,” the Republican wrote in his predictably juvenile and whiny style. “It will be Broadcast Live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.” In the same online missive, the former president claimed that “the Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate” — I’ll never know why he capitalizes random words — suggesting the candidates’ microphones will be muted except when they’re answering questions, just as the Republican's team had hoped. So, all’s well that ends well? Not exactly. As is too often the case, when it comes to his own candidacy, Trump is an unreliable narrator. The New York Times reported: A Harris campaign official also confirmed with NBC News that negotiations are still underway over microphone rules. In other words, the GOP nominee told the public that the debate over the debates had been resolved, which came as something of a surprise to members of Team Harris, who knew better. For those who might benefit from a refresher, Trump initially agreed to a debate schedule three months ago, which included a Sept. 10 event on ABC News. That, of course, was when the former president assumed his opponent would be President Joe Biden. After the Democratic incumbent passed the torch to Harris, Trump abandoned his “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping and took a variety of clumsy steps to back out of his earlier debate commitments. In fact, three weeks ago, Team Trump made what appeared to be a categorical announcement: The GOP candidate would not participate in ABC News’ Sept. 10 presidential debate. Seven days after backing out of the debate, however, Trump reversed course and re-accepted the invitation. Around the same time, the former president held a Mar-a-Lago press conference in which he also announced the dates of other upcoming debates that hadn’t been negotiated and therefore might not occur. Two days later, on Aug. 11, Trump published a middle-of-the-night missive to his social media platform, further alerting the public to a made-up debate schedule, pointing to events that no one had agreed to. Earlier this week, the former president took all of this in an even weirder direction, signaling his newfound reluctance to participate in the Sept. 10 debate. As members of his campaign team worked behind the scenes to keep microphones muted during the event, the Republican candidate himself said he didn’t much care either way, necessarily undermining his own team in public. He added that he believed ABC News should be “shut out” of the process. Two days later, Trump agreed to the terms of the ABC News event — but he did so in a way that wasn’t altogether true. All of which is to say, the first Harris-Trump debate could be two weeks away, or it might not happen at all. The GOP nominee told the public that the underlying disputes had been resolved, but he apparently made that up, and negotiations over the relevant details are still ongoing. I’m reluctant to guess whether the event will actually happen, though one thing seems obvious: The former president was desperate to share a stage with Biden, and he appears genuinely afraid of Harris. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Kamala Harris is right to not make her race and gender a rallying cry,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-policy-identity-trump-attacks-rcna168255,"Vice President Kamala Harris has embraced a variety of vibes during her still nascent 2024 campaign, but one area where she restrains herself is discussing her race and gender. She doesn’t mention it much on the campaign trail. During her nomination speech at the Democratic National Convention, she declined to call attention to those identities outside the typical introduction politicians give when describing where they come from. In recent campaign ads, Harris is described as the middle-class “daughter of a working mom.” The class description renders her ordinary, and there is no attempt to pique interest over the historic implications of her candidacy as a woman of color. Harris’ reluctance to draw extra attention to her womanhood or her Black and South Asian ancestry has stood in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. At the Democratic National Convention that year, a video screen displayed a montage of all past presidents, and then Clinton emerged to the sound of shattering glass. “I can’t believe we have just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet!” she said in the video, prompting the crowd to erupt into roars. During her nomination acceptance speech, she wore a white pantsuit in a nod to the suffragettes, and she trumpeted how her nomination marked a “milestone” for women. Clinton’s most memorable campaign slogan, “I’m With Her,” highlighted her gender — and nothing else. Harris’ choice to go a different path is wise — and she should stay the course. The uniqueness of her identity as a presidential candidate is self-evident, and she should continue to let Republicans, who’ve come up with a preposterous new birther theory, hang themselves with their own rope with their bigoted fixation on her gender and racial background. But beyond tactical questions, Harris’ lack of interest in drawing attention to the “historic” nature of her candidacy is substantively appropriate, too. Harris’ victory wouldn’t in and of itself usher in widespread change for people from marginalized backgrounds. Only policies can do that. This isn’t an argument that Harris should conceal or whitewash her identity. Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, should feel free to discuss and cherish any aspect of her background, just as any citizen in our multicultural democracy should feel free to. And if the context calls for it, it makes sense for her to elucidate how her identity helps explain her ideological outlook. Harris did this artfully in her DNC speech by recounting how her mother, a “5-foot-tall brown woman with an accent,” was sometimes mistreated but “never lost her cool” and taught Harris to “never complain about injustice but do something about it.” Her recollection of another lesson from her mother hints at her own “show, don’t tell” attitude toward discussing her identity: “‘Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are.’”      "
Trump’s golf club honoring the villains of Jan. 6 is on brand — but no less disgusting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/j6-awards-gala-trump-golf-club-rcna168530,"Next week, the private golf club that former President Donald Trump owns in club in Bedminster, New Jersey, is scheduled to host a “J6 Awards Gala” to celebrate not the people who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but the people who attacked it. Trump isn’t expected to attend, according to reports, even though the Stand in the Gap Foundation, the organization that’s behind the event, boasts that it’s invited him to speak. But Trump doesn’t have to speak for us to link him to this event. It’s being held at a property he owns, and he has been very vocal in his support of the people who brutally attacked police officers in an assault on the Capitol. Last year, he spoke at a fundraiser held at the same golf course in support of the insurrectionists, and he’s hailed the attackers as “patriots” and vowed to pardon them, including those “who assaulted officers.” And even if he isn’t there Sept. 5,  the event’s website promises speaking appearances from Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and former adviser Peter Navarro, who served three months in jail for refusing to comply with the House Jan. 6 committee’s investigation. According to the event’s website, “the J6 Awards Gala … will honor and celebrate the twenty defendants who contributed to the powerful ‘Justice For All’ song” and celebrate “all J6 defendants who have shown incredible courage and sacrifice.” A presidential candidate letting his property be used to host an event where a mob attack on police officers will be celebrated as heroic is blood-boiling. As for the “Justice for All” song, which Trump has his supporters stand for at his rallies, we know the identities of many of the singers from a May 2023 Washington Post report: Texan Ryan Nichols, according to the Department of Justice, drove to the Capitol based on the “belief that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.” Nichols, who pleaded guilty to two felonies, including assaulting law enforcement officers, was wearing body armor as he “delivered two streams” of pepper spray “hitting multiple law enforcement officers.” Nichols also urged his fellow attackers to enter the Capitol with him, and yelled, “If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!” He was sentenced to five years in prison. Before he traveled from Texas to the Capitol, Shane Jenkins, another Texan, posted, “I have some sog tomahawks and tactical blades can I take those?” on social media. He was convicted at trial of eight felony charges and sentenced to seven years. Prosecutors say he pulled a “Sog” brand metal tomahawk axe out of his bag during the siege and used it to break windows. He then “riled up the crowd, telling other rioters, “Bro, we’re going in that f--- building one way or another” and “We paid for it; it’s our f--- building.” Prosecutors say he “hurled nine different objects at the officers” protecting Congress that day. Officer Brian Sicknick was one of the people pepper-sprayed by Julian Khater, another one of the singers of the “Justice for All” song. Khater pleaded guilty to “assaulting law enforcement officers with pepper spray, causing bodily injury to the officers.” Sicknick died the next day. Sarah McAbee, the organizer of this J6 awards gala, is married to Ronald Colton McAbee, a former Tennessee sheriff’s deputy who was sentenced to nearly six years in prison for assaulting police officers with “reinforced knuckle gloves.” Even more despicably, McAbee held down a police officer who’d been “knocked to the ground, kicked and stripped of his baton by other rioters,” enabling the crowd to viciously beat him. Not only are these the people Trump has promised to pardon and the people whose rendition of the national anthem he thinks deserves applause, they’re the people who’ll be celebrated and valorized at Trump National Golf Club. The Jan. 6 attack — as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves said when he testified before Congress in January — was “likely the largest single-day, mass assault of law enforcement officers in our nation’s history.” Graves made it clear that many more than the 140 officers originally reported suffered physical injuries that day — which, as he added, does not even include the scores more who suffered mental trauma. And we’ve horrifically seen several officers die of suicide in connection with what they endured on Jan 6. What Trump is doing and has done is not “treason,” at least not according to the letter of the law. But he has repeatedly provided “aid and comfort” to those who waged the first violent attack on our Capitol since the war of 1812, when the British set it on fire. Trump doesn’t belong back in the White House; he belongs in a prison cell just like the people who will be celebrated next week at the awful Jan 6 gala at his country club. "
The prosecutor populism of Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 4:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-campaign-proposals-prosecutor-rcna168232,"Vice President Kamala Harris is leaning on her decades as a local and state prosecutor to signal her toughness in the presidential race. But that professional experience also shapes her approach to tackling the country's problems. Consider inflation, which has been one of the Biden administration's thorniest political problems. In a speech this month, Harris proposed going after grocery chains that she claimed are using inflation as a pretext to price-gouge consumers. In one line in the speech, she outlined an approach that you might call prosecutorial populism: target the rule-breakers. “Most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case,” she said. You can see echoes of this approach in Harris' Democratic National Convention acceptance speech and other policy announcements: In each case, Harris clearly identified villains and proposed, essentially, prosecuting the cases against them. The benefits of this approach are that it's easy to explain to voters and it forces the political opposition to defend some pretty indefensible behavior. There's a reason defense attorneys have such bad reputations, after all. The populist approach would be to go after the large conglomerates in unflinching language — “every billionaire is a policy failure,” for example — but this prosecutor’s populism is narrower. The large companies breaking the rules are the target, and the solution is to go after them and leave the rest alone. There are limits to this approach. Sometimes a problem doesn't have a clear villain. Sometimes focusing on the people explicitly breaking the rules overlooks the broader problem that the rules created in the first place. Sure, scammy for-profit colleges are bad, but they aren’t the major reason student debt has become such a crippling problem. The prosecutor's mindset can also lead to a focus on easy wins. Being a prosecutor is an inherently political job, but it has much different set of incentives from other positions such as governor or senator. At the local and state levels, prosecutors are typically elected, and many look at their win-loss ratios in court as the best way to persuade voters to re-elect them. That can make them risk-averse, looking for cases with overwhelming evidence or seeking plea deals to avoid the uncertainty of going to trial. That could be a problem for Harris in the White House, where presidents often have to make snap decisions with incomplete information, such as when Barack Obama approved the late-night mission to kill Osama bin Laden. America has had presidents who were prosecutors before. Both James K. Polk and William McKinley got their starts as local prosecutors, and Bill Clinton was Arkansas attorney general before serving as governor. But Harris' experience is much deeper: She was a deputy district attorney, district attorney and California attorney general for 27 years, while she has been a senator and vice president for only seven years. Other presidents have been shaped by their past careers. Ronald Reagan approached the presidency like another acting gig and viewed political problems through the lens of Hollywood screenplays. Obama sometimes sounded like he was still a constitutional law professor, debating with himself whether the president has the power to mint a trillion-dollar coin. And former President Donald Trump still thinks like a real estate developer, promising to build walls and airports and statuary gardens. Harris has leaned heavily on her past as a prosecutor, promising to make the case against Trump, using “for the people” as her campaign slogan and talking about her handling of difficult cases to signal toughness to voters. It has also been used against her, as when some on the left criticized her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign with the meme ""Kamala is a cop."" But based on her policy announcements so far, it's clear that being a prosecutor is more than just a credential for Harris. It's also a mindset that she'll carry with her into the White House."
‘It Ends With Us’ was already problematic. Blake Lively’s press tour made it worse.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/colleen-hoover-blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-booktok-rcna168452,"When Colleen Hoover self-published her first young adult novel, “Slammed,” in early 2012, she was living in a single-wide trailer with her husband and three sons. She made $30 in royalties and was thrilled: It was enough to pay the water bill. Hoover didn’t have a publisher, an agent or a sweeping media tour. She didn’t have rave reviews from book critics at The New York Times or The Atlantic (and she still doesn’t). But less than a year later, “Slammed” made it to the New York Times bestseller list. Since then, Hoover has published 26 novels, outselling James Patterson and John Grisham combined. Hoover’s success is partially due to a literary industry now dominated by women — women readers, women publishers and women authors. According to a 2023 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, women publish more than half of all novels today, and they sell more books than the average male author. This is a relatively new phenomenon, of course. In conjunction with access to the birth control pill, safe abortion and higher education, women’s book publishing exploded in the 1970s. The rest of Hoover’s success is due to passionately loyal fans who evangelize for her on book-centric corners of the internet, including BookTok and Bookstagram. In 2022, well over a million viewers watched TikTok user Eloise Hampson’s tearful time-lapsed videos chronicling her emotional reactions to reading “It Ends With Us” — clutching the purple-and-white cover of the novel. Posts on CoHo, Hoover’s internet nickname and corresponding hashtag, will often involve tears. CoHo continually holds a spot as BookTok’s top read. It’s a chicken-and-egg question: BookTokers know CoHo content will generate likes, views and maybe even a viral payday. Whether or not they actually like her books comes secondary. “It Ends With Us,” Hoover’s top-selling and most literary novel, centers on a florist named Lily Bloom who finds herself at the center of a complicated love triangle between her protective first love and her abusive husband. It starts like a classic romance novel — chance encounter, slow-burn flirtation, passionate sex scene — and shifts to a serious look at abuse. “It Ends With Us” grapples with domestic violence with an intimate partner, generational cycles of abuse, identity, family and love. But many people reading this will know that already. The movie adaption, starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, premiered in early August and quickly exposed a dilemma. As massive as Hoover’s online cult following has become, BookTok culture and fandom did not translate well to a mainstream audience. The book’s Hollywood treatment began with side-eye from Hoover’s BookTok legion for casting choices — particularly for Lively. The media tour was marred by controversy: Questions swirled over a possible cast dispute between Lively and Baldoni, and Lively was lambasted for the way she answered media questions regarding the sensitive topics the movie addresses, namely domestic violence. One particularly damning TikTok on the movie’s promotional page shows Lively, in full glam makeup and wearing a Dauphinette skirt set and chainmail top, cheerfully advising fans to “grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.” Hoover is perched beside Lively in a purple floral Tommy Hilfiger dress appearing to endorse Lively’s tone-deaf messaging. Other choices have irked Hoover’s fan base. Last year, in the lead-up to the film, Hoover announced the release of a coloring book based on the character of Lily Bloom. After immense backlash, Hoover, and her publisher, Atria Books, canceled the publication. The movie drove new potential readers, who aren’t swayed by the powers of BookTok, to pick up their own copy of “It Ends With Us.” The result was an onslaught of fresh criticism for the novel. Readers slammed it as anti-feminist, misogynistic and glamorizing domestic violence. Particularly detrimental is the way the novel romanticizes the cliché dangerous-but-charismatic leading man and its blatant disregard of red flags that, off the page, often mean the difference between life and death for people in abusive relationships. Hoover’s books, for all of their wide-reaching success, are largely critically panned. Hoover’s writing style is juvenile and unpolished, and her dialogue is neither realistic nor particularly creative. But what Hoover does masterfully deliver again and again is emotional intensity, satisfying climactic moments — and lots of sex. Hoover’s writing reads like fan fiction. Although the genre existed well before the advent of the internet, its popularity exploded on chatrooms, message boards and literary subculture websites in the early aughts. Fanfic, a genre unto itself, is generally defined as amateur writers exploring different stories from the original source material (see: every iteration of ""Harry Potter"" romance imaginable on reading platform Wattpad), but now, fanfic as an adjective is synonymous with easy to read, hyperemotional, shallow and crass. There is a long history of disregarding literature written by women for women as vapid and inherently nonliterary. Last season on the ""Velshi Banned Book Club"" podcast, I wrote and produced an episode dedicated to defending so-called chick lit. If a woman enjoys a book, that is justification enough. “It Ends With Us” certainly exists in that space, and the literary merit of the book comes well below the book’s cultural relevancy. Hoover’s books aren’t popular because the writing is so good or the characters are so interesting or the dialogue is so engaging; they’re popular because of internet inertia. The rise of women readership, the normalization of fanfic and the command of BookTok has made for the perfect wet and dark environment for CoHo to thrive. Culturally, for a certain, growing demographic of women, Hoover has become a touchstone, a shared part of society, that is all but required for internet fluency and in-the-know conversation. Hoover proves, with her books and soon-to-be fleet of movie adaptions, that virality, buzz and internet adoration doesn’t equal quality (or taste). Hoover’s problematic writing and behavior still bear a cultural impact. Will this ultimately negatively affect Hoover’s overall success or following? When it comes to BookTok, online lit culture and book sales, definitely not."

Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, a grouping of top stories from the past week found at the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Former President Barack Obama’s cutting, suggestive joke about Donald Trump’s obsession with … crowd … size seems to have been the most widely shared clip from his rousing speech last week at the Democratic National Convention. I certainly found it funny. But I don’t think that should overshadow his critical comments about social media and the provocateurs in the political sphere — like Trump — who use such platforms to sow division and enrich themselves. Hearing that, it was hard for me not to also think of Big Tech powerbrokers like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg; people who’ve either deliberately used their platforms to benefit Trump or whose platforms have been used by bad actors to try to help him. And knowing the role that social media played in Obama’s political rise, I always find it interesting to hear him speaking critically of the types of platforms he once used to reach the masses. Here’s the line: Trump’s tour of the bro-ey podcast circuit continued over the past week, as his campaign tries to woo (chronically online) young men.

Jack Smith files new indictment in Trump election subversion case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 1:29 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 27, 2024, 3:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-jack-smith-superceding-indictment-jan-6-election-case-rcna168502,"Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump in the federal Jan. 6-related prosecution on Tuesday. The superseding indictment presents the same four charges, albeit in a shorter indictment, against the former president. Smith explained in an accompanying filing that the superseding indictment was presented to a new grand jury that hadn’t previously heard evidence in the case and that it “reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States,” referring to the July 1 immunity ruling. In that ruling, the Republican-appointed majority said that Trump is absolutely immune for “core” constitutional acts, presumptively immune for all official acts but not immune for unofficial ones. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the trial court to determine what in the indictment survives the immunity ruling, a process that still needs to get underway. The latest indictment attempts to get ahead of that process by slimming down details from the initial indictment last year that the government thinks could have been objectionable under the immunity ruling. For example, in describing the alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, the superseding indictment emphasizes that Trump’s alleged co-conspirators weren’t government officials at the time and were acting in their private capacity. That emphasis wasn’t included in the initial indictment. Likewise, the special counsel's office removed from its list of unindicted co-conspirators an unnamed Justice Department official — believed to be Jeffrey Clark — whom the initial indictment said “worked on civil matters and who, with the Defendant, attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.” A joint status report detailing how the parties want to proceed is due Friday to the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan; Chutkan gave the Friday deadline before the superseding indictment was issued. Chutkan had extended the deadline after Smith asked for more time to formulate the government's position — time the Justice Department apparently spent getting this superseding indictment. While the new indictment may put the government in a better position to survive the immunity test, the Supreme Court will likely have the last word on the degree to which this superseding indictment can go forward to trial. That final determination won’t likely occur before November, and if Trump wins the presidency, he will be empowered to get rid of the case completely.

"In a critical year, we can't sleep on the GOP's state-level chaos",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-party-chaos-swing-state-election-rcna168488,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 26 episode of ""The Rachel Maddow Show."" In a presidential election year, all eyes, understandably, are often on the two major-party presidential campaigns. But in an election year like this, with just two months to go until the big day, may I also suggest that you do not sleep on what is happening in the states — because sometimes what’s happening in the states seems like it can’t possibly actually be happening.  Take what happened this past weekend in Michigan. On Saturday, former Michigan Republican Party chair Kristina Karamo was escorted out of the state GOP convention by police. As The Detroit News reports: Karamo was elected in 2023 and removed in January of this year. However, she refused to go. In February, a court ruled that she had been removed in accordance with party bylaws, but, as of this summer, she was still trying to get courts to reinstate her as Michigan party chairman. Did I mention that this is one of the most important states in the country for the presidential race?  We pay so much attention to how the two parties’ presidential campaigns compete against each other in various swing state polls, but it’s also worth noticing when things are absolutely bananas with one of the parties in those states. Not long after the Michigan Republican Party went to war with itself, a version of the same thing happened in Florida. Right after Michigan threw out their state Republican Party chair, Florida fired theirs too — following news reports that he was being investigated by police for allegations of rape. Police also said they were investigating Christian Ziegler for video voyeurism charges for allegedly illegally recording a sexual encounter without consent. They later cleared Ziegler of charges in both investigations. Then, right on the heels of that, Republicans in Arizona lost their state party chair after GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake released secretly recorded tapes of Jeff DeWit in which she said he was trying to bribe her. She also reportedly threatened to release more tapes of him. Then the national Republican Party lost its chair. Ronna McDaniel was pushed out — or resigned — apparently to make room for Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. Lara Trump’s experience for the job included ... being a singer. Additionally, she’s married to one of Trump’s sons — the blonde one. So that seems like a totally legit, noncontroversial, meritocratic choice for the leadership of the national Republican Party. This has all happened this year, in 2024: Michigan, Florida, Arizona and the national Republican Party all lost their leadership under embarrassing, if not terrible, circumstances, all in an election year.  Now it’s happened again, this time in Colorado. On Saturday, Colorado Republican Party members met to vote out the state chairman, Dave Williams, who they said was destroying the party. Williams is now refusing to recognize the validity of the vote to remove him — because of course. He called the meeting on Saturday “illegitimate.” As of Sunday, the day after they voted to fire him, Williams at least still had custody of the Colorado Republican Party letterhead, on which he released a statement that said his firing was a sham and he was still in charge. So you have one person who says she’s still the chair of the Republican Party in Michigan, who was escorted out of the state convention by cops this weekend, while fists flew. And you have another person, who says he’s still the chair of the Republican Party in Colorado, even after he was voted out by other Republicans.  Doesn’t it seem like a great idea to put these folks in charge of the whole country?

Jack Smith hits back at Judge Cannon's nonsensical ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-judge-aileen-cannon-classifed-documents-donald-trump-rcna168473,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 26 episode of ""The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell."" On Monday, federal prosecutors filed a brief urging an appeals court to reverse Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case against Donald Trump. Last month, Cannon, a Trump appointee, tossed out the case and ruled that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded.  Now, some things in the law are open to debate and reasonable disagreement and others are not. Every method of interpretation of the law — whether it’s text, history or precedent — is devastating to Cannon’s decision. Smith could go into the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back and he would still win this every day of every week. Smith acknowledged as much in Monday’s brief, using words like nonsensical, misguided, strained and erroneous to describe Cannon’s ruling. I’d pay good money to read the first draft of that brief because he probably used some words that weren’t quite so restrained.  The truth is, a first-year law student could dismantle Cannon’s opinion — frankly, even a pre-law student. You don’t have to go to law school to see the clear faults in her argument.  Just for starters, and this is a point Smith emphasized in his brief, in 1974 the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in the Watergate case. In that ruling, the judges took the very laws that Attorney General Merrick Garland cited for the appointment of Smith and agreed it gave the AG power to appoint a special counsel.  Cannon has argued the Supreme Court’s review of special counsel authority in that case was merely “dicta,” or a passing remark in the ruling that wasn’t necessary to the holding of the case. To put it mildly, that conclusion is nuts.  Cannon claims the special counsel was appointed illegally and therefore Smith has no authority to issue an indictment. Well, the same thing was true in the Richard Nixon case. Nixon argued the special prosecutor subpoena should be quashed — that it was outside the bounds of the law. But the Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that there are specific statutes that authorize the appointment of the special counsel, so the subpoena could not be quashed.  That’s just one of the many faults in Cannon’s ruling. With Smith’s brief now filed, I expect the 11th Circuit to reject her nonsensical opinion and get this case back on track. "

A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charges the former president with the same four counts he faced in the original indictment returned last August: conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.” * Consumer confidence: American consumers felt more confident in August as their outlook for the future improved. The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 103.3 in August from 101.9 in July. The index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.” * Difficult diplomacy: “President Joe Biden’s top Middle East adviser on Tuesday held talks in Doha with senior Qatari leaders on the efforts to complete a cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas as well as Qatar’s prime minister meeting this week with Iran’s president, according to a U.S. official.” * In related news: “Israeli forces rescued an Arab citizen of Israel during an operation in southern Gaza, the Israeli military said on Tuesday, more than 10 months after he was abducted alongside about 250 others during the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7.” * The latest Jan. 6 sentence: “The very first rioter to breach the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack was sentenced to more than four years in federal prison on Tuesday after telling a judge that he still believes Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election ‘to this day.’” * Zelensky’s plan: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that this month’s lightning-fast incursion into Russia — where almost 600 Russian soldiers have been captured so far — is part of a larger plan to end the war in his country.” * Once this case was assigned to a Trump-appointed judge in Texas, the lawyers probably should’ve just started preparing the appeal: “A federal judge in the Eastern District of Texas on Monday temporarily blocked a Biden administration program that allowed undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to apply for green cards without leaving the U.S.” * All is not well in Florida: “For years, L.G.B.T.Q. people planning a trip to Florida could turn to the official website for Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing organization, for resources on where to go, what to eat and where to stay. ... But sometime in the past few months, Visit Florida — a private-public, nonprofit partnership created by the Florida Legislature in 1996 — quietly took down pages with information for L.G.B.T.Q. travelers.” See you tomorrow."
Trump allies indicted in Arizona fake electors scheme get a 2026 trial date,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 1:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arizona-fake-electors-2020-election-trump-allies-rcna168466,"A judge in Arizona has set a Jan. 5, 2026, trial date for allies of Donald Trump who have been charged for their roles as fake electors in a scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. At a hearing Monday, Arizona Superior Court Judge Bruce Cohen scheduled the criminal trial to begin just one day shy of the fifth anniversary of the Capitol riots, though he called the 2026 date a “moving target.” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, in April announced the indictment of 18 Trump allies over their efforts to subvert the election results in the former president's favor. One of the defendants pleaded guilty this month, and another, lawyer Jenna Ellis, has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. The remaining 16 defendants who face criminal charges include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; Trump's former legal adviser John Eastman; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who is currently spearheading the Republican National Committee's ""election integrity"" efforts. All of them have pleaded not guilty. The Arizona case is so far the only state-level criminal prosecution related to efforts to steal the 2020 election that has set a trial date. Trump is identified as a co-conspirator in the Arizona case, but he has not been indicted. Defendants on Monday also tried to argue for dismissal of the charges by claiming that they infringed on their First Amendment rights, a defense that cites the state's anti-SLAPP law. Cohen has indicated that he is open to the defense, Politico reported. As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out, the GOP has consistently rewarded alleged fake electors in several states, elevating them to prominent positions within the party. Some have been renominated as Republican presidential electors in the November election, and others — including several Arizona defendants — were picked as delegates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July."

Why do Republicans keep forgetting who was president in 2020?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-keep-forgetting-was-president-2020-rcna168496,"Given Russia’s efforts to interfere in the United States’ 2016 presidential election, officials were on high alert during the 2020 race for similar tactics. With this in mind, when The New York Post published a notorious report on Hunter Biden’s laptop during the race four years ago, U.S. agencies suspected it was Russian misinformation. So did social media giants, which temporarily limited access to the story. Facebook was among the tech companies that acted, and Mark Zuckerberg has long said he wished his company had handled the matter differently. The CEO reiterated that point in correspondence this week with Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. Donald Trump apparently found all of this significant anew and published this missive to his own social media platform. For readers interested in punctuation and grammatical rules, I’d note that the former president’s rant started with quotation marks, but there was no end-quote. I’ve long since stopped trying to understand his idiosyncratic approach to the language. Nevertheless, as is often the case, Trump probably saw a headline or two, failed to grasp the relevant facts, and published some online hysterics that didn’t really make any sense. But of particular interest was a pertinent detail the GOP candidate overlooked: He was president in 2020, not Joe Biden. Look at the rant again: To hear Trump tell it, “the White House” was responsible for trying to suppress a controversial report, which in his mind, necessarily meant that the 2020 election was “rigged.” But in light of the fact that we’re talking about events that unfolded in 2020, he was referring to his own White House. It’s striking how often this comes up with Republicans. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia last year blamed the Biden administration’s policies for a Michigan woman whose sons died in 2020 — when Biden was a private citizen and Trump was president. Months later, Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas blamed Biden for “paying people to stay home” in 2020, referring to a law that Trump signed into law. The same week, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado blamed the Democratic president for Covid-related school closures in 2020 — which, again, was a year that Biden spent campaigning, not in the Oval Office. It also wasn’t too long ago when former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pointed to crime data from 2020 to blame Biden for the U.S. murder rate, apparently unaware that it was her former boss who was president at the time. More recently, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody took aim at the Biden administration’s approach to criminal justice protests in 2020 — when there was no Biden administration. Evidently, Trump is equally forgetful. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Judge halts Biden program that protects undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 12:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/judge-halts-biden-program-undocumented-spouses-immigration-rcna168387,"A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked a new Biden administration program that allows undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens to remain in the country with their families while applying for green cards. In the ruling Monday, U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker sided with 16 states that had sued the administration, writing that their claims against the program, called Keeping Families Together, “are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date.” The states all have a Republican attorney general. Undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens typically have to leave the country to apply for a green card, but the “parole in place” program allows them to remain in the U.S. during the process. The plan, touted as a key part of President Joe Biden’s pledge to “promote family unity” in the immigration system, was announced in June, shortly after the president signed a widely criticized executive order to limit the number of asylum-seekers entering the country when border crossings reach a certain threshold. The green card program was hailed as a bold approach that is more in line with his promise of a more humane approach to immigration policy. It was also seen as a potentially transformative move that could affect the November election. According to the White House, an estimated 500,000 people were eligible for the program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had begun accepting applications on Aug. 19. The 16 red states, led by Texas, sued the Biden administration Friday, arguing that the executive branch had no authority to grant such sweeping parole to undocumented immigrants and claiming that it “incentivizes illegal immigration and will irreparably harm” their residents. Notably, Barker wrote in his ruling that the stay applies only to federal agencies’ ability to grant parole in place. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will continue accepting applications for the program but that it will not be approving requests while the stay is in place."
Border-wall politics trips up Trump’s 2024 campaign (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 12:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-wall-politics-trips-trumps-2024-campaign-rcna168472,"A few months ago, Donald Trump boasted that during his term, he “built 571 miles” of border wall. The former president added that he was poised to add another 200 miles within a few weeks, concluding, “I built much more wall than I said I was going to build.” All of this was spectacularly untrue. In fact, every element of the Republican’s claims turned reality on its head, badly distorting the facts about an issue he appears to consider one of his top priorities. It was emblematic of the GOP’s broader problem with the debate over border policy: Reality keeps getting in the way of their campaign rhetoric. The Washington Post, for example, recently published an analysis of the party’s advertising, highlighting dozens of ads that criticize the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the border, “while showing chaotic scenes that were filmed in 2018 under the Trump administration.” One commercial in particular showed footage of Central American migrants in Tijuana rushing the southern border. The voice-over and text blamed Democrats for the unrest, which actually unfolded during Trump’s presidency. It was against this backdrop that the former president traveled to Arizona last week for a border-wall photo-op, though Team Trump apparently forgot to care about the details. The Post reported: There was a dramatic problem with the rhetoric: As the Post’s article explained, “This section of 20-foot steel slats was actually built during the administration of President Barack Obama.” In case this isn’t obvious, Democrats have never said border barriers are entirely unnecessary between the Pacific Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. There are high-traffic areas, party officials have long said, in which it makes sense to have structures to prevent illegal crossings. Throughout Obama’s term, it was not uncommon to build and repair barriers along these parts of the border. As of last week, Trump tried to take credit for some of the Obama administration’s work, either (a) hoping the public wouldn’t know the difference, or (b) cluelessly unaware of reality. Whatever the explanation, the Republican keeps trying to make a border wall the centerpiece of his bid for a second term, and he keeps tripping over it."
"Despite commitment, Trump hedges on scheduled debate with Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 27, 2024, 12:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-hedges-presidential-debate-kamala-harris-election-2024-rcna168170,"UPDATE (Aug. 27, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET): Donald Trump on Tuesday, after calling for ABC News to be ""shut out"" of the presidential debates a day earlier, said he will participate in the network's Sept. 10 debate with Kamala Harris. UPDATE (Aug. 26, 2024, 1:24 p.m. ET): This story has been updated to include Donald Trump's comments to NBC News on Monday, saying he believes ABC News should be “shut out” of the debates and stating he would be OK with keeping microphones unmuted. Keeping up with Donald Trump’s positions on presidential debates has been like watching a misshaped ball bounce in unpredictable directions. As the post-convention general election phase begins in earnest, the problem actually seems to be getting worse. The Washington Post reported: Before delving into the Republican’s latest online tantrum, let’s review how we arrived at this point. In mid-May, Trump agreed to a debate schedule, including a Sept. 10 event on ABC News, when the former president assumed his opponent would be President Joe Biden. After the Democratic incumbent passed the torch to Harris, Trump abandoned his “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping and took a variety of clumsy steps to back out of his earlier debate commitments. In fact, three weeks ago, Team Trump made what appeared to be a categorical announcement: The GOP candidate would not participate in ABC News’ Sept. 10 presidential debate. And then things got even weirder. Seven days after backing out of the debate, Trump reversed course and re-accepted the invitation. Around the same time, the former president held a Mar-a-Lago press conference in which he also announced the dates of other upcoming debates that hadn’t been negotiated and therefore might not occur. Two days later, on Aug. 11, Trump published a middle-of-the-night missive to his social media platform, further alerting the public to a made-up debate schedule, pointing to events that no one had agreed to. By and large, much of the political world simply ignored the Republican’s odd rambling and remained focused on the Sept. 10 debate that both campaigns had agreed to — that is, until Trump published a new rant that put the future of that event in doubt. “I watched ABC FAKE NEWS this morning, both lightweight reporter Jonathan Carl’s(K?) ridiculous and biased interview of Tom Cotton (who was fantastic!), and their so-called Panel of Trump Haters, and I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?” the former president wrote. Trump went on to suggest Donna Brazile (whose name he misspelled) might secretly give Harris the debate questions; the vice president's “best friend” leads ABC News (I don’t know whom Trump was referring to); before concluding, in reference to George Stephanopoulos, “Where is Liddle’ George Slopadopolus hanging out now?” Obviously, making predictions based on Trump’s juvenile rhetoric is folly, but his screeds did not sound like a candidate eager to appear on a debate stage. Complicating matters further, Politico reported that the Harris and Trump campaigns are still negotiating the terms of the scheduled Sept. 10 debate, and one of the sticking points is whether the candidates’ microphones “will be muted when it isn’t their turn to speak.” According to the reporting, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, members of Team Harris want the microphones to stay on — in keeping with modern practices — because they assume Trump won’t be able to keep his composure for 90 minutes. “We have told ABC and other networks seeking to host a possible October debate that we believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast,” Brian Fallon, a senior adviser on the Harris campaign, told Politico. “Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. We suspect Trump’s team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit they don’t think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.” Where does this leave us? With a great deal of uncertainty about whether Trump and Harris will ever share a stage. In case this weren't already complicated, Trump denounced ABC News again on Monday morning, telling NBC News that ABC should be ""shut out"" of the debates. The Republican, as part of the same comments, said he doesn't care about the microphones issue — contradicting his own team — adding that his focus is on the networks. “I’d much rather do it on NBC,"" he said. ""I’d much rather do it on CBS. Frankly, I think CBS is very unfair, but the best of the group, and certainly I'd do it on Fox. I’d even do it on CNN; I thought CNN treated us very fairly the last time.” Trump went on to say that Harris ""doesn’t want to debate,” which was amusing given the circumstances."

Lawsuit against Georgia Election Board seeks to 'prevent chaos’ in November,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 11:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/georgia-election-board-rules-lawsuit-rcna168427,"In one of the latest legal fights brewing ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Democrats in Georgia have filed a lawsuit to prevent chaos and confusion in the battleground state. The petition against the State Election Board was sparked by two rules passed by the Republican-majority board regarding election certification, a process that should be straightforward but that the GOP has sought to complicate. The petition for relief, filed Monday in Fulton County Superior Court, seeks a court declaration that the rules are invalid, laying out the issue this way: The petition explains that under these two new rules, election officials in the state would have to (1) conduct a “reasonable inquiry” prior to certification and (2) allow individual county board members “to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.” One problem with the rules is that they suggest that certifying the election results is a discretionary process. But it’s a mandatory one, and any fraud or misconduct allegations are meant to be resolved in court through legal challenges, not by county boards during the counting process.   “To the extent either rule does allow election officials to delay certification or not certify — as the rules’ drafters avowedly intend — it is invalid,” the petition argues, seeking to “prevent chaos in November” by clarifying the issue now. Certifying election results shouldn’t be a contentious issue. But Republicans backed by Donald Trump have made it one recently, most notably culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol following the 2020 election that Trump lost to Joe Biden. Whatever the results of the coming election, a court order that makes clear the uncontroversial process of counting ballots should make it a less chaotic one.

Police endorsement for Gallego adds to Kari Lake's woes in Arizona Senate race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 11:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/ruben-gallego-kari-lake-arizona-senate-police-endorsement-rcna168435,"As far as endorsements are concerned, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is running up the score in his U.S. Senate race against Republican nominee Kari Lake.  Gallego has already flexed some of his bipartisan appeal in this race by touting dozens of endorsements he's received from Republicans, including sitting officials. Lake has tried to counter by promoting some Democrats who say they support her — though her group has lacked the local gravitas (i.e., name recognition) of Gallego's group. So Gallego’s endorsement from the conservative Arizona Police Association on Thursday adds to the pile-on. The organization, an advocacy group for law enforcement officers, has endorsed Trump in this election (a disturbing development, in my view) but apparently preferred to give Lake the cold shoulder in favor of her opponent, despite her fealty to Trump’s agenda. The organization touted Gallego's ability to secure funding for law enforcement nationwide and in Arizona specifically in the press release announcing their endorsement. ""As a Marine combat veteran, we know Congressman Gallego understands the complexities of modern policing in American society today, while at the same time recognizing the public's expectations,"" APA President Justin Harris wrote. (Harris is the guy you might have seen Trump urging offstage midspeech during a campaign stop in Arizona last week.) Of course, endorsements aren’t everything in a campaign. Neither are pre-election polls, which have generally shown Gallego with a pretty substantial lead in the weeks before early voting begins. Obviously, a win for Lake certainly remains a possibility. But the endorsements and the polls do measure ... vibes: They can tell us valuable things about how a candidate is being perceived or how well their strategy seems to be working. And in that sense, this latest APA endorsement seems like another indicator that Lake’s decision to mimic Trump’s tics and lines of attack aren't working for her. For example, as part of her election denialism, she’s attacked mail-in voting, which is used by a majority of Arizonans. She’s insulted fellow Republicans — including late Arizona Sen. John McCain — just as Trump has. And much like Trump, she’s often seemed more focused on promoting her personal brand and elevating her profile than on campaigning — so much so that earlier this year, even Trump reportedly expressed concern about how often she's at Mar-a-Lago. Other swing state GOP candidates for Senate have had to reckon with this reality, too, from failed Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz to former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler. And like them, it doesn’t appear to be a winning formula for Lake. When a Republican is so extreme or inauthentic that they turn off the Arizona Police Association, that’s a clear sign that it's time for a new strategy."
"Trump targets Harris, Walz with entirely made-up claims",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 11:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-targets-kamala-harris-tim-walz-claims-election-2024-rcna168458,"At a campaign event in Arizona late last week, Donald Trump spent a predictable amount of time targeting Vice President Kamala Harris, specifically telling his supporters, “Nobody lies like her. She is a liar. She makes up crap.” The Republican’s rhetoric was rather ironic. After all, the former president is not only the most prolific liar in recent memory, he makes stuff up on a daily basis. Indeed, minutes after insisting that the Democratic nominee “makes up crap,” Trump told the same audience that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “approved a bill to give tampons in every young man’s bathroom.” In reality, Walz did no such thing. In a speech in which the GOP candidate complained about campaign dishonesty, he peddled campaign dishonesty. Two days later, Team Trump released a campaign ad that insisted the Biden/Harris administration has “literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips.” As a Washington Post fact-check report explained, that didn’t happen. Note, this wasn’t an off-hand and unscripted comment at a rally; the Trump campaign carefully included this specific phrasing in a paid television ad. The Republican operation almost certainly knew the claim was baseless, but the former president and his 2024 team pushed it anyway. A day later, Trump spoke at the National Guard Association’s conference and took care to blame Harris for America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago, despite the fact that (a) it wasn’t Harris’ call, (b) Trump’s the one who negotiated the withdrawal agreement, and (c) his own White House national security adviser said Trump bears some responsibility for what transpired. All of which leaves the political world with an awkward question: If Harris and Walz are as awful as Republicans claim, shouldn’t Trump be able to make a compelling case against them without making stuff up? Shouldn’t it be easy for the GOP nominee and his allies to stick to reality-based critiques? Doesn't the fact that the former president has to rely so heavily on dishonesty reinforce the idea that maybe Harris and Walz aren’t so bad after all?"
Texas is the latest battleground in Trump's war against voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 9:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-ken-paxton-lulac-doj-rcna168224,"For years, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has easily ranked among the most destructively partisan and self-servingly venal elected officials in the country. And last week, he turned his sights on suppressing the votes of Texan Latinos this fall in the name of “election integrity.” On Wednesday, Paxton’s office announced that it had carried out an undisclosed number of search warrants in several counties, including the one that houses San Antonio. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America’s oldest Latino civil rights groups, says the raids targeted several of its members. In doing so, Paxton has tipped his hand about his determination to undercut voting rights this fall — and potentially made an enemy of the very people the GOP needs to win. Republicans have twisted the phrase “election integrity” since well before President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Rather than a dedication to ensuring that every vote is counted, the GOP has coopted it as a justification for suppressing legal votes while claiming to prevent election fraud. We’ve seen efforts in other GOP-led states set up by election security offices that have brought few charges and failed to prove widespread fraud exists. Paxton’s latest stunt goes further, though, indicating a newfound focus on suppressing the work of an organization rather than disparate individuals. His office’s statement last week asserted that the searches were the result of a two-year investigation of supposed “allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting” in the 2022 election but did not specify the targets of the raids or why specific homes were raided. The GOP wound up winning all of the counties where the claim that was sent to Paxton originated, but they are also in south Texas, a region that showed mixed results overall in the midterms. The second of the two potential crimes that Paxton is investigating — “vote harvesting” — is a particularly glaring sign that there’s most likely very little substance to these allegations. In using the term, the GOP tries to evoke the incredibly rare act of someone fraudulently collecting other people’s absentee ballots and casting those votes without their awareness. But in practice, Republicans are usually referring to two entirely legal practices: establishing secure ballot drop boxes or organizations’ working to ensure that senior citizens who are unable to make it to polling places have access to mail-in ballots. The latter practice appears to be Paxton’s target, based on details reported Monday in The New York Times. Lidia Martinez, an 87-year-old living in San Antonio, who was one of the people whose homes were searched, has worked for decades helping older Latino voters register to vote. She told the Times that the officers who turned up at her house in the early morning last week were looking for voter cards that Latino residents had filled out. Finding none in their ransacking of her home, they took her laptop, her phone and other items, but not before questioning her about other LULAC members, including others whose homes had been searched. In a news conference outside Paxton’s office Monday, LULAC’s national president accused the attorney general of seeking to “harass and intimidate Latino nonprofit organizations, Latino leaders and LULAC members” with an aim to “suppress the Latino vote.” The Latino vote in Texas has become a major driving force in determining which way the seemingly deep red state swings. Most recently, growing and increasingly diverse populations in Texas’ major cities have cut into the GOP’s dominance in statewide elections, providing narrower margins of victory in those races. At the same time, Texas has underscored that Latinos as a group are nowhere near monolithic. Democrats’ share of Latino voters in South Texas counties near the border has dwindled in recent presidential elections, making their votes more highly sought-after. While that may seem to be contradictory with Trump’s racist policies and statements against immigrants from Central and South America, there’s no denying that his rhetoric about border security has resonated with voters there. That’s also increasingly the case in those same major cities that have been recently been seen as Democratic strongholds. Which leads us to Paxton’s motivations in drawing the ire of LULAC with these raids. The group had never formally backed a political candidate in its 95-year history — until this month, when it endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Paxton hasn’t exactly been a subtle operator in the past. If his office hadn’t blocked mail-in applications ahead of the 2020 election, Paxton claimed on former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s podcast in 2021, “we would’ve been one of those battleground states that they were counting votes in Harris County for three days and Donald Trump would’ve lost the election.” He also most likely feels emboldened to take bigger swings after the state Senate acquitted him of corruption charges in an impeachment trial last year. Paxton also has the comfort of knowing that he’s carrying out the will of the national GOP and its presidential nominee. Trump has instructed the Republican National Committee to devote more resources to election integrity than traditional fieldwork ahead of this election. Just last week, he insisted at a rally in North Carolina that the GOP’s “primary focus is not to get out the vote, it is to make sure [Democrats] don’t cheat.” But for the Republican plans to challenge election results in court to succeed, there needs to be a convincing case that there’s more than partisan politics at work. In targeting such a specific group and its members, Paxton may have undermined those efforts. Already, LULAC is asking the Justice Department to investigate Paxton’s efforts as a potential violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Even with years of conservatives’ narrowing the Voting Rights Act’s scope, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division can flex plenty of muscle if it believes a state has moved to suppress a minority group’s vote. Paxton may have thought that LULAC would be easy pickings or that the searches he authorized would subdue its efforts to get Latinos to the voting booth this fall. But given the response so far, I don’t think this is the fight that Paxton wanted — or one that he has much of a chance of winning."
"Hundreds of former Bush, McCain and Romney staffers back Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 9:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hundreds-former-bush-mccain-romney-staffers-back-harris-rcna168430,"Late last week, the two major-party presidential nominees traded notable endorsements. On the one hand, Donald Trump picked up support from independent conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which didn’t seem to bother Democrats at all. Around the same time, Kamala Harris and her team said they would see the RFK Jr. endorsement and raise Team Trump with a dozen Republican White House lawyers who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, each of whom are now supporting the Democratic nominee. This week, something similar happened. Trump picked up backing from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, at which point members of Team Harris again said they’d see the former congresswoman’s endorsement and raise Trump a whole lot more of bipartisan support. USA Today reported: If this sounds at all familiar, President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign received similar backing from former Bush, McCain, and Romney staffers four years ago. The difference is, the number is even larger now. “We reunite today, joined by new George H.W. Bush alumni, to reinforce our 2020 statements and, for the first time, jointly declare that we’re voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz this November,” the letter reads. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.” These new endorsements, eagerly touted by the Democratic nominee’s campaign, came on the heels of Harris also picking up a variety of other Republican endorsements and Democrats including some GOP speakers at the party’s convention in Chicago. To be sure, there’s room for debate about the electoral impact of announcements like these, but don’t be too quick to overlook the broader context. Trump continues to insist, on a daily basis, that the vice president is a radical communist hellbent on destroying the American way of life. It’s against that backdrop that hundreds of Republicans, who’ve held public office and/or served in GOP administrations, keep coming forward to effectively remind the electorate just how wrong the former president’s attacks are."

Ruben Gallego picked up an endorsement this week from the Arizona Police Association. The same law enforcement association endorsed Donald Trump last week. * At his latest campaign stop in Michigan, Trump claimed Rep. John James secretly won the 2020 U.S. Senate race that James, in reality, actually lost. * Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign is over, Cornel West’s independent presidential campaign is apparently making appeals to anti-vaccine voters. * On a related note, the Trump campaign has confirmed that RFK Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have been added to the Republican’s 2024 transition team. * And in Maryland, the latest AARP poll found Harris trouncing Trump by 32 points, but the same survey found Republican Larry Hogan and Democrat Angela Alsobrooks tied in the state’s U.S. Senate race, 46% to 46%.
