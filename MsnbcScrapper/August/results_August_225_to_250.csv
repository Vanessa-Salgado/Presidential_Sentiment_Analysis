The Harris-Walz campaign announces a big social media push,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 1:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-walz-campaign-whatsapp-latinos-social-media-rcna167439,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, a round-up of the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. The Harris-Walz campaign announced the launch of a WhatsApp channel, expanding its social media outreach to the messaging app that’s immensely popular in some Latino communities. The move can also be seen partly as an effort to combat the spread of right-wing misinformation on the platform: A Nielsen report in 2021 found Latinos were more likely than other groups to receive, consume and share misinformation, and it cited WhatsApp as a hub where much of that misinformation was exchanged.

Kennedy Jr. claims he falls for A.I.-generated misinformation ""all the time,"" which is actually not all that surprising to hear from a known conspiracy theorist. But also, not ideal coming from someone running to be president of the United States. Read more at Mother Jones. The U.S. intelligence community is alleging Iran is responsible for hacking attempts targeting both Vice President Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s presidential campaigns (at the moment, only the Trump campaign has said it was hacked). Iran denies the claim, and while several news outlets say they have received campaign materials from a source identifying itself only as ""Robert,"" none of those outlets have shared what they've received. As my colleague Steve Benen wrote, this is in line with what Trump’s campaign has demanded of the press, even though he took completely the opposite approach when Hillary Clinton’s campaign was hacked by Russia in 2016.

Singer Chappell Roan's TikTok exposes the distressing impact of stan-dom,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 1:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chappell-roan-tiktok-fans-stalking-harassment-rcna167382,"Singer Chappell Roan has spoken openly about feeling overwhelmed by the fame that followed her stratospheric rise to pop stardom over the past year. And on Monday, she elaborated on those feelings, expressing frustration with entitled fans and saying people have been harassing her and stalking her family. ""If you saw a random woman on the street, would you yell at her from the car window? Would you harass her in public?"" she asked in a video on TikTok. ""Would you go up to a random lady and say, 'Can I get a photo with you?' And she's like, 'No, what the f---,' and then you get mad at this random lady? Would you be offended if she says no to your time because she has her own time?"" Roan said in a subsequent video that she didn't care if such behavior from fans was par for the course for public figures: The 26-year-old pop star, who has been making music since her teenage years, became a massive commercial phenomenon in the past year after she opened for Olivia Rodrigo’s world tour and released her single “Good Luck, Babe!” in April. Roan has talked about her disdain for fans who feel entitled to her time and affection in the past. Her rejection of being on the receiving end of parasocial relationships — that is, a one-sided emotional bond someone creates with a person they don't actually know — is not uncommon among celebrities, though Roan is more outspoken about it than most. The downsides to ""stan culture"" are also well-documented; artists have alluded to the lack of privacy and demand for access into every aspect of their lives, and some celebrities have been accused of sanctioning their fans' bad behavior toward other public figures.  In a podcast interview last month, Roan said that fans have been tracking her movements and unearthing details about her family. She said she previously told herself she would consider quitting music if fans' behavior crossed the line. ""We're there,"" she said, adding: ""I've like pumped the brakes on honestly anything to make me more known."""
AOC once electrified the left. Now she electrifies the party establishment.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 1:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aoc-speech-dnc-gaza-left-rcna167346,"At the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., got 90 seconds to speak. Ocasio-Cortez was then a freshman lawmaker who’d toppled a 10-term Democratic incumbent with a left-wing campaign that shocked the party and the country. Her speech, delivered on the second night of that convention, was about rallying progressives and seconding the presidential nomination of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. It was a symbolic move because he had lost his presidential campaign, his second one, in the primaries. She spoke about her loyalty to a “mass people’s movement,” which she said was needed to address the “brutality” of the economy, recognize “colonialism” and propose “deep systemic solutions.” She was speaking at a convention for the party, but her remarks were aimed at the party’s shortcomings. Ocasio-Cortez’s speech Monday night couldn’t have been more different.  She was given seven minutes during a prime-time slot on opening night. She introduced herself as a former waitress but made no mention of her background as a left-wing political organizer. She wasn’t sounding a dissenting note about a failed insurgency; instead, she was firing up the crowd for the nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Gone was the talk about a mass movement; Ocasio-Cortez focused on the health and the future of the Democratic Party, including winning not just the White House, but majorities in both chambers of Congress. While Ocasio-Cortez spoke about class divisions, the rhetoric was dialed down, more in line with the party establishment’s generic conception of the wealthy versus the rest. Ocasio-Cortez's praise for Harris for being “for the middle class because she is from the middle class” made her sound more like a centrist Democrat than a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Monday night's Ocasio-Cortez had grown into a creature of the establishment, both for better and for worse. The contrast between her two DNC appearances illustrates Ocasio-Cortez’s swift ascendance within the party. Ocasio-Cortez remains the leading voice of “the Squad,” the most progressive bloc of lawmakers in the House. But her collaboration with President Joe Biden during his time in office — during which he governed further to the left on social spending and climate policy than anyone expected — has resulted in her evolution from gadfly to strategic progressive partner for the party. She serves as an advocate and surrogate for certain sectors of the left within the party, but simultaneously maintains increasingly strong ties with the upper echelons of the party. She did not play hardball with Biden with defections from his bills as he compromised on progressive legislation to win over conservatives in the party. And in the most striking display of her change to date, Ocasio-Cortez, alongside Sanders, argued for Biden to remain the party’s presidential nominee even as the party establishment turned on him after his fateful June debate performance against former President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez’s rationale for that may have been based primarily on the strategic belief that Biden was more reliable than any potential establishment successor as a friend of the left. But still, her sticking vociferously by his side despite his extreme unpopularity reflected a strategic calculus removed from her background of channeling grassroots energy. Becoming an operator means more input into consequential policy. But it often also means becoming a more pliant politician. The most striking — and disappointing — moment of Ocasio-Cortez’s speech came when she praised Harris for “working tirelessly to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.” It was a stunning dodge on the biggest issue for the American movement left today. The Biden administration has long stated that it desires a cease-fire; the real problem is the administration’s failure to take any punitive steps against Israel, which has shown stunning disregard for civilian life in Gaza while contemplating radical solutions at odds with international law and dragging its feet. Ocasio-Cortez could’ve called for the party to focus on the plight of Palestinian civilians there, or reverse its wicked policy of defunding the UNRWA that makes it harder to get life-saving supplies distributed throughout the territory. She could’ve issued a subtle challenge to Harris to take a position on conditioning aid to Israel. She could’ve supported some of the protesters raging outside the convention as calling for overdue moral clarity. Instead, she used her influence as the most prominent progressive in Congress to give Harris a green light without Harris having really done anything to earn it. And, thus, Ocasio-Cortez summed up the vexing eternal trade-offs of gaining power: The closer one gets to the center of power, the less capable one is of fundamentally challenging it."
Why the DNC already has Republicans scared,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 12:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-dnc-republicans-patriotism-trump-harris-rcna167393,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 20 episode of ""Morning Joe."" You look at the first night of the Democratic National Convention and you just can’t calculate that. You can’t fake that level of joy. People are either enjoying themselves and are happy or they’re not.  As for the Republican ticket, you have two candidates — who at least publicly — project misery. They’re not happy. They’re always looking for retribution. They’re looking for people to blame. They’re looking for a reason to be upset. They’re looking for a reason to resent.  It couldn’t be more different for the Democrats. I swear, I never thought I would see this in my lifetime. As a Republican, I thought it was just too easy to beat Democrats because they’re afraid to have a good time. They’re afraid to be joyful. But what Republicans watching at home feared the most Monday night was not just the joy radiating from the crowd, but also their chants of “USA, USA, USA.” Why did that message ring true at the DNC? Because the Republican Party has sold itself to a man who lies about America. A man who says we’re a nation in decline, a nation of losers, that we’re on the verge of collapse. That is not true. The data doesn’t bear it out, economically, militarily, culturally, socially — in every way.  This is a great country. That’s why the Democratic Party is cheering and those cheers give them a hell of a contrast with the presidential candidate on the Republican side who talks down about America every day on the stump."
The most powerful moment of the DNC so far was also the most sickening,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 12:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-speaker-hadley-duvall-abortion-amanda-zurawski-rcna167413,"From a rousing, passing-of-the-torch speech from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to a career-defining address from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it was women — both the child-free and the moms — who mostly defined Day 1 of the Democratic National Convention.  President Joe Biden’s keynote notwithstanding, it wasn’t a seasoned politician, former party leader or Hollywood A-lister who delivered the most moving moment of the evening. Because an hour before the president delivered his address, three ordinary women stole the show with their brave and — incredibly awful — stories of life in a post-Roe world. Amanda Zurawski, Kaitlyn Joshua and Hadley Duvall — three abortion storytellers who shared some of the most harrowing, painful moments of their lives in front of millions — crystalized a sickening reality. Women (and some men) are still being asked to tear themselves open again and again in order to prove we are all worthy of respect, autonomy and basic human rights. Women (and some men) are picking open scabs on live television, reopening intensely personal wounds for public consumption and discussion. I don’t disagree with their inclusion last night. It was smart, and necessary, for the Democratic Party to not only center abortion, but also center abortion stories. The party has been playing a losing game of defense, with many leaders seemingly too scared to even say the word “abortion” out loud. Last night, the people most impacted by abortion bans and anti-abortion restrictions were finally front and center.  This shift is no doubt the result of decades of work from grassroots organizers and abortion advocates, such as Renee Bracey-Sherman and the team at We Testify, an organization dedicated to the leadership and representation of abortion-seekers, as well as Amelia Bonow, co-founder of Shout Your Abortion, a nonprofit dedicated to normalizing abortion. Studies have shown that personal stories are far more memorable, more powerful and more convincing than statistics, and Democrats are finally acting accordingly.  But these stories shouldn’t be necessary. We should not need to hear from a woman like Zurawski — who detailed just how excited she was to become a mom to Willow, only to go into early labor at 18 weeks and nearly die after she was denied a lifesaving abortion.  We should not be forced to relive the journey as Joshua was turned away from not one, but two Louisiana hospitals —  despite her severe pain from a miscarriage — in order to better understand that comprehensive prenatal care must include abortion care, and that states that ban or severely restrict abortion access have higher rates of maternal and infant mortality. And it’s only getting worse. Duvall, who was raped by her stepfather after enduring years of sexual abuse, should not have to recount the moment her pregnancy test flashed positive at age 12 for all of us to unequivocally call anti-abortion laws exactly what they are: inhumane.  “What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?” Duvall asked the crowd, sucking the air out of Chicago’s boisterous United Center. What is so great about a country that has made such a question necessary?  Women revealing their forever-healing scars in a desperate plea to be believed, to be valued, to be treated as equal human beings. This is not a bug, but a feature of this country.  From Black women recalling their near-death experiences in order to highlight Black maternal mortality inequality and demand equitable prenatal care, to Indigenous women sharing their devastating experiences of sexual abuse to underscore the fact that an estimated 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in their lifetimes, to a woman detailing one terrifying moment in a department store changing room to prove a former president should never be allowed near the White House again, the path to progress has been paved by women’s pain — and their willingness to tell us about it. So while I am forever grateful for Zurawski, Joshua, Duvall and every single abortion storyteller who has bravely made their personal story public, I look forward to the day when I never have to hear another story like theirs told in a basketball stadium again.

Joe Biden couldn't let go of the past in his DNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-speech-dnc-2024-past-harris-election-rcna167325,        
"Gaza, Israel loom large over the DNC, even if the speakers hardly talked about it",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 11:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/gaza-dnc-protests-speeches-sidestep-israel-war-rcna167336,"Amid the show of unity on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, it was impossible to ignore the deep divisions within the party on Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza. As Democrats cheered their old guard passing the torch, those in the crowd who spoke up against the United States’ role in the war were promptly silenced, and the speakers onstage largely sidestepped the issue altogether. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York progressive who has criticized Israel’s conduct in the war and the Biden administration’s weapons shipments to Israel, only mentioned Gaza while praising Vice President Kamala Harris for “working tirelessly to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.” Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia said he wished for “the poor children of Israel and the poor children of Gaza ... to be OK” as part of a broad appeal for unity. The most direct reference came from President Joe Biden, who spoke about his efforts to broker a cease-fire deal and get humanitarian aid into Gaza. “Those protesters out in the street, they have a point,” he said, echoing his past acknowledgment of the suffering in Gaza. “A lot of innocent people are being killed — on both sides.” As Biden spoke, a few people in the arena unfurled a banner that read “Stop Arming Israel” amid the “We ❤️ Joe” signs, and a man nearby quickly tried to snatch it away. A reporter inside the venue said the section’s lighting was turned off and the protesters escorted out. Earlier in the day, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched to the United Center, where the convention is being held. A small group of demonstrators broke through a security fence, clashing with police. The “uncommitted” movement, successful enough to send a number of delegates to the DNC this week, has made clear its intent to pressure Harris, who has expressed sympathy for Palestinians while affirming the U.S.’ military and political support for Israel. Pro-Palestinian activists are hoping that Harris will be more receptive to their demands than Biden. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say, since Israel launched its assault after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that killed about 1,200 people. Democrats did hold a panel on Palestinian human rights ahead of the main programming on Monday night. Attendees listened to a pediatric doctor describe the horrific injuries in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis unfolding there. A longtime Democratic organizer, Hala Hijazi, broke down as she talked about how more than 100 relatives of hers have been killed in the conflict. “My family’s dead, y’all. They’re dead,” she said through tears. “And I feel guilty because for 25 years I’ve been living my American dream while they are struggling.”"
Will Trump keep his promise about releasing his medical records?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 11:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/will-trump-keep-promise-releasing-medical-records-rcna167411,"It’s been more than five weeks since Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, though the former president and his political operation have been less than transparent about the medical care he received and the nature of his injuries. It was against this backdrop that CBS News asked the Republican nominee a good question this week. At that point, the GOP candidate proceeded to talk about his “perfect score” on a cognitive test — a subject he’s long struggled to understand — and his belief that every candidate should take one. Trump did not say, however, why he hasn’t yet released his latest medical records to the public, or how long it will take for him to “very gladly” follow up on his promise. Time will tell whether the Republican keeps his word, and given recent history, there’s reason for great skepticism. Indeed, as regular readers know, he’s long adopted a rather untraditional approach to sharing information about his medical exams. It started before he took office. In late 2015, during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Team Trump released an unintentionally hilarious, four-paragraph letter from the late Dr. Harold Bornstein, asserting that Trump’s “physical strength and stamina are extraordinary” and that his lab tests results were “astonishingly excellent.” The doctor added at the time, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” We learned several months later that Bornstein wrote the letter in five minutes while a limo, dispatched by Trump, waited for the document. In the years that followed, disclosures did not improve. Last fall, Trump released the first updated report on his health in more than three years, but it came by way of a statement issued by one of his golf club customers, and it omitted basic details such as his blood pressure and medications. More recently, the former president and his team also ignored calls for medical details after he was shot in the ear. As of this week, however, the GOP candidate made it sound like he’d be only too pleased to share his medical records with the public. If this actually happens, it’ll be a pleasant change of pace — which is why I’m not holding my breath. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Raphael Warnock gave Democrats a dire warning on Night 1 of the DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 11:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/raphael-warnock-dnc-speech-2024-rcna167389,"There was no shortage of inspiring speeches during the first night of the Democratic National Convention, and Sen. Raphael Warnock's was one of the most rousing. There were many moments in the Georgia Democrat's almost 14-minute speech that stuck out, but his warning about the Republican assault on voting rights resonated with me the most. It was a reminder, to anyone who needed it, that the GOP's election subversion efforts surrounding Jan. 6, 2021, never actually ceased — and that Georgians know this firsthand.  He said: Following Donald Trump’s 2020 loss in Georgia, and his failed pressure campaign seeking to overturn the results, Georgia Republicans have instituted some of the strictest voter suppression measures in the nation. Along with that, as my colleague Lisa Rubin wrote for MaddowBlog on Tuesday, Trump loyalists who make up the majority of the Georgia State Election Board have disturbingly altered the electoral process in ways that will make it easier for right-wing election officials to delay certifying local election results should Trump lose in November. Warnock’s warning sounded similar to things I’ve heard and read from Georgia activists who have cautioned Democrats not to lose sight of the right-wing assault on voting rights and fair elections, even as the palpable vigor surrounding the Harris-Walz campaign and recent polling data have Democrats feeling better about their prospects for winning the state.  Georgia, after all, has become a testing ground for some of the Republican Party’s most illiberal experiments, as they try to grease the skids for Republican victories in November. It’s safe to assume their attacks on democracy will only grow more desperate if polling data continues to show Vice President Kamala Harris with more support than Trump has in the state. And several states have followed in Georgia’s footsteps, passing a host of revanchist voter suppression policies of their own.  So I appreciated the senator’s balanced tone in his speech. He energized listeners with talk about all the things a Harris presidency might be able to achieve, such as expanded health care access, improved child care, reproductive rights and peace for children in Israel and the Gaza Strip. But he reminded them of the obstacles — dubious, right-wing laws — they’ll need to overcome to give Harris a chance. The Harris-Walz campaign seems to understand this, given recent reports that it has been staffing up its legal team to combat any election chicanery Republicans may try. And that's good news. Because, as Warnock alluded, officers indeed quelled a violent insurrection Jan. 6, 2021. But the right-wing assault on democracy hasn’t died down since then. "
What Kamala Harris needs to say about Gaza at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 10:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-gaza-dnc-biden-rcna166752,"When it comes to the suffering in Gaza, Vice President Kamala Harris is not President Joe Biden. The people Biden angered with his words, his policies and his “bear hug” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already get that. In fact, the leaders of Michigan’s “uncommitted” movement, who in February convinced more than 100,000 voters to not support Biden in the state’s presidential primary election, have made that very point. In 2020, nearly an estimated 69% of Arab or Muslim voters supported Biden. As Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the uncommitted movement, said at a recent news conference, “There are early indications that there is an openness to engaging with our movement that feels like a shift from how our requests were being treated previously.” Layla Elabed, another co-founder, counted it a positive sign that Harris’ comments after meeting with Netanyahu in July included mention of the horrific suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Harris pointed to “the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time … We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.” Then, she added powerfully, “And I will not be silent.” But the leaders of this movement, which also includes large numbers in other swing states, note that for Harris to truly inspire people, she needs to do more than change tone. She must articulate a new way forward. And the perfect place to do that is at this week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. On the upside, the movement is already seeing results with the Democratic National Committee, on Day One of the convention, holding the first official panel to discuss Palestinian human rights. Panelists included Elabed, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and former Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich. In advance, the uncommitted movement called the panel “an important step toward recognizing the rightful place of human rights advocates for Palestinian rights within the Democratic Party.” And to Harris’ credit, she broke from Biden on his Gaza policy in early March, long before she became her party’s presidential nominee. At the annual commemoration of “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Alabama, she became the most senior member of the Biden administration to publicly call for a cease-fire in the Gaza war. She spoke then of the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and said, “What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed, women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration.” She poignantly added, “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” While Harris reiterated the Biden administration’s “unwavering” commitment to Israel’s security, at the same time, she criticized Netanyahu for imposing restrictions on humanitarian relief and said there can be “no excuses” for not allowing food, water and other supplies into Gaza. Harris’ remarks were a far cry from Biden’s comments weeks after Hamas’ horrific Oct. 7 terrorist attack and Netanyahu’s brutal response that has killed thousands of civilians and collectively punished the more than 2 million people of Gaza. When he was asked then to respond to reports that nearly 2,700 Palestinian children had been killed by Israeli military action, Biden said coldly, “I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed.” Then he added, “I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war.” Since then, Biden has expressed far more compassion for Palestinian suffering, most notably at the State of the Union address where he spoke of the “heartbreaking” killing of “thousands and thousands” of “innocent women and children” and he has worked for a cease-fire. However, to many, Biden’s pivot comes across as less of an organic shift and more like a response to the political pressure. Not only was the uncommitted movement exerting such pressure, but polling from around that time showed that only 36 percent of Democrats approved of Netanyahu’s military actions in Gaza. Add to that, Biden was being vocally pressed to change course in Gaza by Black leaders who represented a core part of his base. But Harris represents something unique for the 80 percent of Democrats who have long supported a cease-fire in Gaza. She is a person of color. For many in the Arab and Muslim community, she looks like family. Both of her parents, as she notes in her book, “The Truths We Hold,” grew up under British colonial rule: her father in Jamaica and her mother in India. And it was her parents’ activism, especially her mother’s participation in the U.S. civil rights movement, that inspired her to become active in politics. Harris’ family history enables her — in a way that Biden cannot — to viscerally understand the pain of a people, in this case the Palestinians, seeking self-determination and equal rights.  I have heard an openness to voting for Harris from many in the Arab and Muslim community — some of whom had vocally opposed Biden because of his Gaza policy. They applaud her words, but policy matters far more. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn, Michigan, made that point on NPR after praising Harris’ criticism of Netanyahu. “What we want is more than just someone who is tough on rhetoric,” he said. “We want somebody who is tough on policy.” The Democratic convention is the perfect platform for Harris to address this. She needs to use this moment to share a policy-based vision for going forward. She needs to expound upon the comments she made after meeting Netanyahu last month, when she spoke of ensuring that “the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.” Consistent with that, she could condition aid to Israel based on committing to a two-state solution. Harris could also vow to enforce the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which requires that any security assistance or military equipment provided to another country by the United States be used in accordance with internationally recognized human rights. This is the very law that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other Democrats want enforced against Netanyahu’s administration. And the list goes on of possible policy prescriptions Harris could announce to show a commitment beyond words, including a potential arms embargo if Netanyahu refuses to use U.S.-supplied weapons in accordance with international law, or she could promise to no longer protect Netanyahu and his administration before the U.N. Security Council by vetoing resolutions that target his government. She could also vow to impose additional U.S. sanctions on extreme settlers engaged in violence directed at Palestinians in the West Bank — where my relatives live. We all get that former President Donald Trump would be far worse for the Palestinian people and for our communities here in the United States. As president, Trump delivered all the right-wing wishes of Netanyahu, including moving the U.S.embassy to Jerusalem, no longer viewing Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal — despite international law to the contrary — and cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to agencies that provide vitally needed assistance to Palestinian refugees. And during his 2024 campaign, Trump has not only cheered on Netanyahu’s war in Gaza but has used the term “Palestinian” as a slur to describe Biden and even Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Few in the uncommitted camp — if any — will vote for Trump. But inspiring the hundreds of thousands of Arabs and Muslims and our allies in swing states from Michigan to Georgia to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania will take more than good vibes from Harris. It will take a well-articulated policy."
2024 electoral map gets a jolt: How many red states are in play?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-electoral-map-gets-jolt-many-red-states-are-play-rcna167378,"With roughly 76 days remaining before Election Day 2024, plenty of voters are eyeing electoral maps, gaming out which states the candidates and parties will need to prevail. The list of battleground states is familiar: Democrats have long believed that success in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan will be essential to a 2024 victory, while Republicans hope to reclaim Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. But what if the map is expanding in unexpected ways? Around this time a month ago, that’s precisely what Republicans were counting on. The Wall Street Journal highlighted a polling report from Blue Rose Research, a Democratic firm, that found President Joe Biden not only losing every battleground state, but also struggling in New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia, Maine and even New Jersey — states he won with relative ease four years ago. A month later, Biden’s re-election effort has ended; Vice President Kamala Harris has picked up the Democratic torch; and the conversation about traditional blue states turning red has effectively run its course. It’s been replaced by a very different kind of discussion — about traditional red states possibly turning blue. Rolling Stone reported: The article, which hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, quoted one GOP operative who said, in reference to the party’s internal data, “They’re looking worse than they should.” This dovetailed with a New York Times report that noted, “Two private polls conducted in Ohio recently by Republican pollsters — which Mr. Trump carried in 2020 with 53 percent of the vote — showed him receiving less than 50 percent of the vote against Ms. Harris in the state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the data.” As for the Sunshine State, USA Today reported last week, “The red wave that washed over Florida in recent years might not be as large as it once seemed, if a new presidential survey is any indication. Vice President Kamala Harris is within ‘striking distance’ of former President Donald Trump in Florida, according to the pollster behind a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University/WSVN-TV survey of 500 likely voters released Tuesday.” While that poll found the GOP nominee ahead in his adopted home state by five points, a Florida Atlantic University poll released around the same time found Trump’s leads over Harris at just three points. (As is always the case, click the links for information on the surveys’ methodologies and margins of error.) To be sure, Democrats continue to see states like Ohio and Florida as aspirational electoral goals, and when the Harris campaign announced its latest round of investments, neither Florida nor Ohio were among the states where the Democratic ticket will be spending limited resources, at least not yet. But (a) that could change in the coming weeks; and (b) North Carolina was among the states Harris is targeting, despite its recent history of backing GOP candidates. In fact, Democrats appear cautiously optimistic about North Carolina — a state Trump won four years ago by just 1 percentage point — and recent polling has bolstered the party's attitudes. In mid-July, the electoral map was expanding in ways that excited Republicans. In mid-August, there’s still some fluidity to the map, but the GOP’s excitement has turned to anxiety."
Disney drops its 'surreal' claim to keep a wrongful death suit out of court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 2:37 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 20, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/disney-plus-lawsuit-wrongful-death-subscription-rcna166618,"UPDATE (Aug. 20, 12:53 p.m.): Disney is now dropping its bid to keep a wrongful death lawsuit out of court based on the plaintiff having signed up for its streaming service, with the company saying that it strives “to put humanity above all other considerations.” Not many people read all (or any) of the fine print when they sign up for a Disney+ account (or any account, for that matter). Perhaps even fewer people would think that such a routine action would block their subsequent wrongful death lawsuit on their spouse’s behalf from being heard in court. Yet that’s essentially what Walt Disney Parks and Resorts lawyers have argued in their push to force such a case into arbitration. They raised the claim in response to the wrongful death suit in Florida state court from Jeffrey Piccolo, who said that his wife, Kanokporn Tangsuan, died from an allergic reaction after eating at a restaurant at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World. Disney’s lawyers argued that the matter should go to arbitration, citing terms they said Piccolo agreed to in creating a Disney+ account and in using a Disney website to purchase tickets to Epcot. In a lengthy court filing this month, Piccolo's lawyer disagreed with Disney's stance, calling it “preposterous” that Piccolo somehow bound the then-nonexistent estate of his wife “to an arbitration agreement buried within certain terms and conditions.” The implications of the company’s position, he went on, are that: He argued that logic “borders on the surreal.” It’s difficult to disagree, though the law can take on a surrealistic quality when someone is suing a large company. Whether this case remains surreal will become more apparent after a court hearing previously set for Oct. 2.

Even some Republicans are skeptical of Comer’s new 2024 crusades,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 8:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/even-republicans-are-skeptical-comers-new-2024-crusades-rcna167353,"By every metric, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer’s impeachment crusade against President Joe Biden was a humiliating failure. The Kentucky Republican set out to uncover evidence of wrongdoing and undermine the Democrats’ 2024 nominee, and the GOP congressman ended up finding nothing and watching the incumbent retire. Even many members of Comer’s own party concluded that his efforts were a fiasco. It’s against this backdrop that the hapless chairman apparently has a new plan: Comer’s crusade against the original Democratic ticket was a flop, so he’s trying again with the new Democratic ticket. Politico reported last week, for example, that the Oversight Committee chair is launching an election-season investigation into Vice President Kamala Harris’ work regarding the southern border. As last week neared its end, Comer announced his panel would also investigate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s ties with China. The obvious problem with the Republican congressman’s antics is that he apparently believes the House Oversight Committee is little more than a partisan super PAC. The less obvious problem is that even some of Comer’s intraparty allies — the ones who were frustrated by his failed anti-Biden scheme — think he’s still off-track. Axios reported: The same GOP member went on to tell Axios, “We have an election to win. Don’t make these people [Harris and Walz] martyrs.” Democrats are even less pleased. The same report quoted Rep. Dan Goldman saying, “I don’t think any rational person would see this as anything other than continuing to use official congressional authority, improperly, to help Donald Trump’s electoral goals.” The New York Democrat added that Walz and Harris haven’t “done anything that merits an investigation other than [being] on the Democratic ticket.” In all likelihood, Comer will ignore the latest round of criticisms. Indeed, his anti-Biden gambit was seen by both parties as a debacle quite a while ago, and he nevertheless kept it going for a year and a half, indifferent to the toll it was taking on his credibility and reputation. With this recent history in mind, the Kentuckian will likely shrug his shoulders and keep going after Harris and Walz, despite the abundant evidence that he has engaged in an election-season stunt. That said, if Comer is hoping to see anyone take his latest efforts seriously, the Republican is likely to be disappointed."
The GOP’s offensive against Tim Walz takes a decidedly weird turn,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 7:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-offensive-tim-walz-takes-decidedly-weird-turn-rcna167343,"In March 2021, The New York Times described Sen. Ron Johnson as “the Republican Party’s foremost amplifier of conspiracy theories and disinformation.” It’s been discouraging to see the Wisconsin senator spend the three years that followed proving the criticism true. A month ago, for example, Johnson appeared on Fox News to talk about the assassination attempt that targeted Donald Trump. “I’ve seen some pretty interesting video on the internet by experts that certainly calls into question what the FBI is telling us about a single shooter,” the GOP lawmaker said, apparently indifferent to the fact that those discredited videos were spread by fringe conspiracy theorists. A month later, Johnson again spoke to Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo, and as The Independent noted, the Wisconsin Republican shared some similarly weird thoughts. No, seriously. Johnson — a man Senate Republicans put in charge of the Senate Homeland Security Committee for six years — told a national television audience with a straight face, “It’s very strange. [Walz] got married on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square. He’s gone to China. He’s taught in China. He’s got deep connections to China.” Hours later, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer appeared on Fox News and suggested that it’s “very possible” that China has been “grooming” Walz for decades. Chris Lehmann’s latest piece for The Nation made the case that too many Republicans “have a bad case of Walz Derangement Syndrome,” and lawmakers like Johnson and Comer are helping prove the point. I am, of course, mindful of the broader circumstances. After Vice President Kamala Harris tapped the Minnesota governor for the Democrats’ 2024 ticket, the race was on in GOP circles to define a man who was largely unknown to a national audience. But Republican efforts have become so utterly ridiculous that they’re literally unbelievable. The smear of Walz’ military service was ugly and wrong; the Somali flag story was idiotic; the tampons story was worse; and practically every other line of attack the GOP has come up with has proved to be false or exaggerated. And that apparently led Johnson and Comer to start pushing weird rhetoric about the governor and China. The question for voters is straightforward: If the Democratic vice presidential nominee is so awful, why are his Republican critics stuck peddling nonsense?"
The Georgia election board is rewriting election law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/georgia-election-board-grubbs-rule-rcna167241,"While much of the news media is focused this week on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, I've got Georgia on my mind. Why? Because the Georgia State Election Board, during its meeting Monday, considered even more rules and amendments to existing rules governing the state's elections. Over the last two weeks, as I and others have documented, the board — composed of a Republican chair, three Donald Trump loyalists praised by the former president as “pit bulls,” and a lone Democrat — pushed ahead with two new concerning actions. First, it approved a new rule that allows county election boards to delay certifying their results while conducting “reasonable inquiries."" Then, it voted to direct Georgia's attorney general to investigate an already-settled complaint about Fulton County's 2020 ballot tabulation errors. (The state's AG, Chris Carr, advised the board before its vote that reopening a complaint would be unlawful and released a formal written opinion Monday stating the board has no right to direct him to conduct any such investigation.) Both steps taken by the election board have been roundly criticized as wolves in sheep's clothing, election administration edition: They are seemingly neutral processes, implemented in Georgia counties. In reality, they're intended to prevent the certification of some counties' or even statewide results. Yet, the Georgia Election Board was hardly content to stop there. At Monday's meeting, it approved an amendment to an existing rule proposed by Cobb County GOP Chair Salleigh Grubbs. As laid out in Grubbs' petition, the amendment requires county boards to conduct a precinct-by-precinct “reconciliation” of votes in which they must “compare the total number of ballots cast to the total number of unique voter ID numbers.” It further requires that if there is any discrepancy between the two, no matter how small or non-outcome-determinative, an investigation must be launched. “No votes shall be counted from that precinct” until the results of that investigation are presented to a county board, the petition states. But that's not all. The so-called Grubbs Rule also empowers county-level election commissioners to “examine all election-related documentation created during the conduct of elections prior to certification of results.” That lesser-known feature of the rule has been flagged to me by voting rights lawyers and activists as not just a way to delay or withhold certification, but more significantly, a potential means to collect ""evidence"" to perpetuate another “big lie” should Vice President Kamala Harris win the presidential election in Georgia.  Throughout the public comments during Monday's meeting, Georgia election workers from counties all over the state, interested residents and civil rights advocates all raised concerns that the Grubbs Rule would prevent counties from reporting results by the time required by state law. Instead, the rule ""would set 159 counties up for failure,"" as one election worker noted. Nevertheless, proponents of the rule suggested that all they are doing is ensuring compliance with existing Georgia code. Former Homeland Security official and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli even tried to distance the reconciliation proposal from the 2020 election interference scheme, suggesting ""the other side was complaining in 2016 ... and it's whoever loses complains."" Sadly for Cuccinelli, however, the ultraconservative ""voter fraud conspiracy"" group True the Vote, which has been focused lately on challenging voter registrations in multiple states, dropped the ruse. In a celebratory tweet, the group praised the Georgia election board for establishing ""a common sense audit trail"" in passing the Grubbs Rule. That there will be a need for an audit in any specific Georgia county, much less all of them, is simply assumed. And so, Georgians barrel toward a November election where their election board has approved a series of arcane, but dangerous, procedures aimed at avoiding county-level certification and fueling tales of fraud and woe. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has been stripped of his role on the board, and short of certifying the state's results without wayward counties, may be unable to do much. It's not clear Carr or Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp can stop the board either (although Kemp has received a complaint from the former Fulton County Election Board chair asking him to remove three board members for their unlawful conduct). Will Georgia's courts ultimately be the state's best hope for timely and fair elections? Watch this space."
Officials confirm: Iranian hackers breached Trump’s 2024 campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/officials-confirm-iranian-hackers-breached-trumps-2024-campaign-rcna167333,"It was 10 days ago when Donald Trump’s campaign said that it had been hacked by an Iranian group in June. As it turns out, the claims were apparently true. NBC News reported: “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” the agencies said in the statement. The fact that the joint statement referenced the “campaigns” was notable in part because Team Trump apparently wasn’t the only target. NBC News’ report added, “The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked.” Iran, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing. To date, news organizations have not published any of the information obtained from Trump’s political operation, which is certainly in line with the Republican campaign’s appeals. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process,” Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement when the allegations first reached the public. Team Trump added, “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” At first blush, that statement seemed largely unremarkable. In fact, what Cheung claimed turned out to be true: Team Trump was breached; documents were obtained illegally; the thieves were apparently foreign adversaries; and their goal was to interfere in an American presidential election. There is, however, a disconnect between the message and the messenger. As Robert Schlesinger explained in a piece for The New Republic: Quite right. In 2016, when it was Russia targeting the U.S. presidential election and exposing materials stolen from Democratic computers, Trump celebrated WikiLeaks, cheered on his benefactors in Moscow and publicly urged Americans to embrace the hack and its ill-gotten gains. At the time, it was Democrats who issued statements such as, “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” And it was Trump who effectively said, “I don’t care.” As far as the Republican is concerned, documents obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to sow chaos throughout our democratic process, must be rejected — unless they benefit his quest for power."
The feud continues: John Kelly rejects Trump’s Medal of Honor line,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/feud-john-kelly-rejects-donald-trump-medal-honor-election-2024-rcna167321,"Donald Trump’s lengthy record of disparaging military service took a turn for the worse last week when the former president said the Presidential Medal of Freedom was “much better” than the Medal of Honor because those who receive the nation’s highest military honor are often wounded or dead. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, among others, condemned the rhetoric as “asinine.” In an interview with an NBC affiliate in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, which aired on Sunday night, the Republican tried to clarify his position, though he effectively just reiterated the comments that sparked the original controversy. Trump’s former White House chief of staff saw his former boss’ comments and apparently felt compelled to condemn what he heard. CNN reported: “Think of Normandy, Iwo Jima, Vietnam or Fallujah,” Kelly told CNN. “The Medal of Honor is earned, not won, by incredibly brave actions on the battlefield under fire typically by very young men who joined when others did not to defend their country. Their oath to the nation is essentially the oath the president and members of Congress take, that federal judges take, that political appointees also take and includes ‘...that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties...’ “To the service member, the oath is sacred and taken with the understanding that one could be seriously wounded, captured or killed in living up to the words. No president, member of Congress, judge or political appointee — and certainly no recipient of the Presidential Medal — will ever be asked to give life or limb to protect the Constitution. The two awards cannot be compared in any way. Not even close.” In terms of accuracy and propriety, there can be no doubt that the retired four-star Marine general has the facts on his side. But stepping back, it’s also worth emphasizing the fact that it’s remarkable to see the former president and his former White House chief of staff repeatedly clashing as the election season progresses. As recently as late June, Trump, unprompted, lashed out at Kelly as “dumb” and a “lost soul.” Months earlier, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” There was no great mystery as to the motivation for the offensive. After all, Kelly is the one who confirmed on the record that Trump really did denigrate American servicemembers as “suckers and losers.” “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly told CNN in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of, among other things, “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues,” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. The fact that the Republican nominee is publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Joe Biden didn’t just pass the torch at the DNC — he paid tribute to the future,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-dnc-speech-kamala-harris-rcna167174,"President Joe Biden wiped away tears as he stepped out onto the Democratic National Convention stage on Monday night. His daughter Ashley had just given him a tremendous introduction, following on the heels of her mother, first lady Jill Biden, who had herself followed a line of speakers who thanked Biden for his leadership and strength. Monday night was all about giving Biden his flowers, with signs reading “We ❤️ Joe” waving in the crowd as he composed himself to deliver his speech. The night’s program ran long, so Biden didn’t take the stage until more than a half-hour after he was scheduled to. But he was also early, as he had originally expected to address the crowd in Chicago on Thursday night as the party’s 2024 nominee. But there was no sign of the reported anger or bitterness that Biden felt over this decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, as his successor in the White House. Instead, the president was in the pocket for this speech, fired up in a way he hadn’t been in months, blowing the doors off his State of the Union address this year. This was Biden in his element, unleashed and ready both to brag a little about his accomplishments and channel righteous anger at the ways former President Donald Trump and his movement have hurt, and will hurt, the country. Recounting why he decided to run in 2020, he once again told the story of seeing the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, the night before 2017’s “Unite the Right” rally. “They didn’t even bother to wear their hoods,"" Biden said. “Hate was on the march in America. Old ghosts, in new garments.” He looked back at the successes of his administration, the legislation that’s been passed, how far we’ve come since the depths of the pandemic when he was first elected. It’s a laundry list of accomplishments that Biden had expected to run on himself. Instead, it will be the foundation of Harris’ campaign, as she calls for continuing — and expanding upon — the work of the last four years. But Democrats made sure to give credit where credit is due, with most speakers taking time to shout out Biden’s wins. “Thank you, Joe” rang out from the crowd again and again, including as he spoke. “Thank you, Kamala, too,” Biden told them in response. It was a reverse call-and-response that played out again later into his address, highlighting how Biden has once more embraced this familiar role: acting as a booster and supporter for the person at the top of the ticket. This wasn’t where Biden expected to be two months ago, but he left no doubts that he is all in for his successor and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “I love this job, but I love my country more,” Biden told the crowd, vowing to “be the best volunteer Harris and Walz’s camp have ever seen.” As he worked his way to a close — having surpassed the length of his acceptance speeches in 2008, 2012 and 2020 — he reached back to the early days of his career. “I’m more optimistic about the future now than I was when I was elected a 29-year-old senator,” he told the crowd. He smiled and promised that he meant it; I’m willing to believe it. As Biden concluded, surrounded by family and joined by Harris and her husband, it left me with a feeling that I’d just watched a page turn in America’s history. This was a moment of passing the torch with grace and care in a way that few leaders would have managed when faced with such a decision. What Biden pulled off on Monday night was in its own way as presidential as any official act he’d taken while, as he put it, a kid with a stutter who grew up to sit behind the Resolute Desk."
Why Judge Merchan shouldn’t delay Trump’s New York sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-sentencing-delay-merchan-alvin-bragg-manhattan-rcna167236,"Former President Donald Trump’s effort to dodge accountability for his crimes is still going strong. It’s not just his unhinged campaign for president, which represents an attempt to avoid prison. He has also continued pushing for delays in all four criminal cases against him, most recently demanding his criminal sentencing in Manhattan be delayed until after the election. Because there is no basis for this latest delay under the law and Trump’s political purposes are so obvious, the court should reject this out of hand. Trump was convicted back in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, all to cover up interfering in the 2016 presidential election by paying hush money to an adult film actress to hide their affair. Having already successfully postponed his sentencing from July 11 to Sept. 18, Trump’s attorneys recently asked Judge Juan Merchan to further postpone it until after Election Day. In response, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office on Monday deferred to the judge’s discretion but noted “there are strong reasons” that Trump’s position should be rejected.  Under New York sentencing law, the test Merchan must apply is whether the delay is “reasonable.” It is anything but. For starters, Trump’s motion for delay cites the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. U.S., which provides at least presumptive immunity for official acts. On Sept. 16, two days before the current sentencing date, Merchan will rule on Trump’s motion to vacate his conviction on the basis of that immunity ruling. Trump’s lawyers claim that he cannot be sentenced until after any appeals of the Sept. 16 decision are fully and finally resolved.  Huh? Whatever may be said about the mix of official and unofficial acts at issue in the 2020 attempted coup, which was the subject of the Supreme Court’s decision, the Manhattan case clearly concerns unofficial conduct. As the DA’s office explained in a separate and meticulously detailed filing last month, a presidential candidate conspiring to interfere in an election by paying hush money to a porn star and then falsifying business records to cover it up simply does not describe the commission of official presidential acts.  Moreover, although Trump complains about the admission at trial of evidence relating to events that happened in the White House (such as a conversation Trump had with an official adviser in 2018), this evidence was actually about non-presidential conduct, as I have explained elsewhere. Trump and his lawyers repeatedly commit the fallacy that any time he does something, that makes it official conduct. But that is not what the Supreme Court ruled, and in fact at the Manhattan trial prosecutors adeptly limited the questioning to unofficial conduct.  As Bragg’s office stated in responding to Trump’s request to delay his sentencing, it “is correct that the denial of immunity from prosecution is immediately appealable” — i.e., it would be appealable before trial. “But here, in contrast to defendant’s criminal case in D.C., the question of defendant’s immunity from prosecution is not presented.” That’s because the dispute ultimately concerns the admission of evidence about events during Trump’s presidency, and the DA’s office explained that the “Supreme Court’s recent decision did not consider whether a trial court’s ruling on that distinct evidentiary question is immediately appealable, and there are strong reasons why it should not be.” Criminal appeals are generally decided after defendants are sentenced. There is no reason here to divert from that well-established practice that ensures the prompt and orderly administration of justice. No other defendant would be allowed this pause. Neither should Trump be if we are to live up to the American principle that no one is above the law. Trump’s other arguments fare no better. He also says that the sentencing should be delayed until after the election to “prospectively mitigate the asserted conflicts and appearances of impropriety” that it alleges would infect any sentencing hearing held before the election. But the defense’s repeated claims that Merchan is biased have been consistently rejected by all authorities that have reviewed them, including the New York Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which previously concluded that “the judge’s impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.” In fact, delaying the sentencing until after the election might serve to increase appearances of impropriety. For example, if Trump is elected and then not sentenced to a period of incarceration (although I have argued incarceration would be appropriate given his crimes), the public might think he unfairly received a lighter sentence because he was elected president.  Trump also asserts that the sentencing should be delayed until after the election because doing so would supposedly prevent prosecutors “from filing a sentencing submission,” which would argue what sentence Merchan should impose, before the judge rules on Trump’s motion to vacate his conviction. The defense contends that such a submission would be “personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the Presidency.” But any such submission would not be public. Besides, Trump should not receive preferential treatment merely because he is a presidential candidate. Many criminal defendants are sentenced every day while they might be applying for jobs, yet they are not permitted to postpone their sentencing hearings until after they have completed all rounds of their job interviews. That this applicant is seeking the presidency of the United States does not change a thing.  The purposes of sentencing, whether retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence or incapacitation, are all frustrated when that sentencing is delayed. Given that Trump was convicted of feloniously interfering in the 2016 presidential election and charged federally and in Georgia with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the court should specifically deter him from committing more election crimes in 2024 by handing down its sentence without additional delay, even if the imposition of that sentence is ultimately delayed pending his appeals. A sentence of incarceration, which I have argued is otherwise merited, could protect American voters from imminent election crimes. Moreover, the sentencing hearing is likely to provide valuable information about not only the crimes of which Trump was convicted but also other aspects of his background. It will also allow voters to learn what the judge who oversaw his trial thinks about the seriousness of his crimes. American voters deserve to have that information before they decide whether to vote for defendant Trump in November. Trump should be denied the special treatment he seeks to delay his sentence simply because he is a presidential candidate. To avoid undermining public faith in the rule of law and fairness of the criminal justice system, Trump’s sentencing should go ahead as scheduled."
How Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are charting new territory in normcore,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-doritos-tim-walz-normal-trump-weird-rcna167193,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz single-handedly launched “weird” as the Democrats’ go-to insult for the MAGA crowd this summer. Now he and Vice President Kamala Harris, who has chosen Walz as the running mate in her presidential campaign, are fleshing out for voters the other side of the equation: what it looks like to be “normal.” And it’s going surprisingly well. In short videos shared over social media in recent days, Harris’ presidential campaign has generated a series of viral clips that capture private conversations between Harris and Walz that come across as intimate and improvised. The videos are warm in tone and often funny, and they show the candidates discussing mundane, apolitical topics like food and music.  Over the weekend, Walz posted a video on X showing the two of them searching for snacks at a rest stop during their “Road to Chicago” bus tour. Harris peruses one aisle alongside her husband while asking Walz, “Do you see corn nuts over there, Tim?” Walz then emerges from another with another snack: a big bag of Doritos. Harris gratefully grabs the bag, exclaiming “ah, yeah,” and then immediately continues to hunt for other snacks. The clip lasts just 10 seconds, but it’s strangely arresting. It showcases a scene instantly recognizable to just about any American: hungry road-trippers looking for and discussing their favorite snacks, a familiar blend of tedium and small delights. Whether the scene was in any way orchestrated, the pair come off as relatable humans, and they comport themselves in a way one rarely sees politicians do. Walz’s snack suggestion also incidentally doubles as a reference to Harris’ recent confession that she binged on a “family-sized bag of nacho Doritos” after President Donald Trump won the White House — another recent piece of normcore rhetoric. Harris’ campaign also released video last week of Harris and Walz getting to know each other filled with some genuinely funny moments. In a one-on-one exchange, Walz discloses his affection for “white guy tacos” — that is, tacos without spice — to the consternation of Harris, who reminds him she grew chili peppers at the vice president’s residence. In another moment, the two exchange their favorite music (Harris talks about her mother’s Aretha Franklin super fandom; Walz describes his love for Bruce Springsteen). They also released video of Harris’ first attempt to call Walz to officially ask him to be her running mate, which Walz accidentally missed. It’s impossible to know how much, if any, of these exchanges may have been discussed in advance. But it’s obvious that the conversations are heavily improvised. They’re politicians, not actors, and their laughter, jokes and commentary radiate the warmth of two people with conversational chemistry and a discernible interest in the world outside of politics. Even some of the videos capturing Harris and Walz’s campaign activities have a conspicuously casual tone, showing Harris petting dogs and campaigning once again in Converse Chuck Taylors. And Walz is a normcore warrior on the campaign trail, slamming Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance for faking kinship with the working class he scorns using references to food. Harris’ campaign has struck upon a fresh and surprisingly engaging communication strategy. All politicians want to appear as ordinary citizens who understand the way other ordinary citizens live. But achieving that often involves awkward contrivances, such as stuffing corn dogs into their mouths in front of hordes of journalists at a county fair. Harris’ campaign has avoided hokey press spectacles and instead leveraged smart video production and social media to brandish its normie credentials. Beyond being clever, Harris and Walz’s normcore aesthetic buttresses the emerging populist themes of Harris’ campaign as she goes about unveiling progressive economic policies on housing, medical debt and the child tax credit. And it marks a concerted attempt to contest the claim that far too many have bought: that Trump speaks on behalf of so-called real America. (It is difficult to imagine imperious billionaire Trump and his awkward, chameleon of a running mate, Vance, ever chatting it up so naturally anywhere, but especially not at a rest stop.) Harris cannot win an election based purely on impressive social media optics and normie vibes. Nor should she. But if she can make a substantive case for how she can make America and the world more just for the masses through progressive policies, then channeling the everywoman and everyman vibes will be more than just a convincing shtick."
Why this Florida school literally threw LGBTQ-friendly books into a dumpster,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 5:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/florida-new-college-book-ban-lgbtq-gender-studies-rcna166845,"On a quiet Tuesday afternoon in August, just a week before students were due to return to campus, the administration of New College of Florida emptied the library of the college’s Gender and Diversity Center by putting those books in a dumpster. They were joined shortly afterward by books from the main library, most on topics related to religion and LGBTQ+ issues.  According to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, New College claimed that by law it couldn’t donate or sell the books, but that’s false — it could have sold or transferred the property, so long as any sale was open to the public. In the past, if space needed to be made and old books removed, students were notified and many of books were claimed. But that didn’t happen here. The book purge happened in the summer, before anyone returned to campus — and as the Herald-Tribune reported, students said they weren’t notified — and before long the vast majority were carted off to the landfill. The books included ""When I Knew,"" a collection of essays about queer self-discovery; an intermediate Hebrew language workbook; and a classic work of medieval European history, John Boswell’s ""Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe."" Christopher Rufo, a right-wing culture warrior appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis as a trustee of New College, has espoused a vision for the college as a “public university, open to all, in which exceptional students of any background can participate in the great tradition of the West.” As part of that new mission, Rufo and the rest of the trustees spearheaded the removal of the program in gender studies at New College, claiming that the discipline was “ideological activism” and that it didn’t fit with the mission of a university. Students and faculty — the ones most affected by this decision — strenuously objected, but were ignored. The dumpster full of books completes this mission that began in August 2023. Rufo posted on X, “We abolished the gender studies program. Now we’re throwing out the trash.” So much for the university’s protestations of innocence.  Although it may seem paradoxical, Rufo’s evocation of “western civilization” sits squarely within a tradition of authoritarians controlling access to knowledge, taking books away from people “for their own good.” There’s lots of history of right-wing takeovers of universities during the 20th century, including the destruction of books about gender and sexuality in 1930s Germany, but as medievalists we see comparisons that stretch further back — much further back. In 1240, King Louis IX of France (also known as St. Louis) decided, without consulting the Jewish community, that the Talmud — the primary text of Jewish law — was “dangerous.” He decided that, in fact, this sacred book that had been used for nearly a millennium was heretical and that the Jews had strayed from “Biblical Judaism” and into error with their newfangled medieval Rabbinic Jewish practice. Louis IX, he told himself, was just the guy to help them out. The Talmud was put on trial, the book literally prosecuted by the chancellor of the University of Paris, the bishop of Paris, the archbishop of Sens and other Christian clerics, with the “case” presided over by Louis’ mother. But the outcome was predetermined. Even as the Jewish community protested, the king seized all the manuscript copies of the Talmud he could lay his hands on. Then, in June 1241, in a square in Paris just across the river from Notre-Dame, he burned those cartloads of books.  In the 13th century, Louis didn’t really care about the Jews nor the Talmud; he was worried about the state of his Christian kingdom, about getting right with God by punishing non-Christians, so that he could literally launch another crusade to the Holy Land. But Louis wasn’t content with controlling what the Jews read; he attempted to convert them by force and threatened to expel any Jews who kept their own copies of the banned books. In 1268, he ordered all the Jews of France to be arrested and have their assets seized. But there was another path. In the 13th century, just across the River Seine from the pyre of burning books, students at the University of Paris (including luminaries like St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas Aquinas) were studying Jewish and Islamic philosophy with such relish that they were dismissed by outsiders as ideologues. History doesn’t repeat, but sometimes it echoes.  The desecration at New College wasn’t the first time and won’t be the last time that ideology trumps the pursuit of knowledge. But if the American right wants to talk about western civilization, then let’s tell the whole story.  Would-be tyrants have been destroying books for centuries, and once you start destroying books, it’s usually not long until you treat groups of people the same way. Purging books according to one’s personal ideology goes against everything that the university stands for.  Here in the 21st century, the leaders of New College who are and dumping books “in the great tradition of the West” don’t really care about their students any more than their fellow travelers from the Middle Ages, who cared more about their own crusades than the free and open pursuit of an education."
Biden’s right that we need new innovations in cancer care. Here’s what we need more.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-cancer-moonshot-first-step-faces-challenges-rcna166604,"At New Orleans’ Tulane University last week, President Joe Biden announced the awarding of $150 million for cancer research through Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), another accomplishment of his “Cancer Moonshot.” The award will go to eight teams around the country for projects that aim to improve the methods by which surgeons remove cancerous tumors. In his remarks, Biden stated that the fund has “set its sights on a big idea: calling on researchers and innovators to pioneer new techniques and technologies to make cancer removal more precise, accurate, successful.” “Imagine cancer surgery that removes all the tumor, the first time, without harming healthy cells,” he said. This announcement marks a goalpost in the Cancer Moonshot work Biden led as vice president, first announced in 2016, the year after his 46-year-old son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. The original Moonshot promised to “make a decade’s worth of advances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, in five years” and “end cancer as we know it.” President Biden re-emphasized this commitment in 2022, including the more specific goal of reducing the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years.  The term “moonshot” used to refer to something that was highly unlikely. However, after we actually landed on the moon, it came to mean something difficult but achievable. Indeed, cancer experts have said the ambitious goals of Biden’s Cancer Moonshot can be achieved. Cancer has been the second most common cause of death in the U.S. for nearly 90 years. It’s the leading cause of death for those under the age of 85. Last year, more than 613,000 people died of cancer, similar to the population of Memphis, Tennessee. More than half of U.S. families have been affected by cancer; 40% of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in our lifetimes. President Biden is among those Americans. Not only did he lose his son Beau to brain cancer, but the president and first lady Jill Biden have had cancerous skin lesions identified and successfully removed. There aren’t that many Americans who think we’ve spent too much money trying to solve cancer; a third or more think we spend too little. However, Biden’s latest announcement regarding increased funding for cancer treatment innovations comes at a time when overall federal funding for scientific agencies is down. That’s why an announcement of this kind is a golden retriever of health causes: it’s widely endearing, politically popular and it has traditionally been bipartisan. Even so, this Moonshot faces significant challenges. First, cancer is a bit of a whack-a-mole; its occurrence changes as our environment and population change. The role of specific cancer risks, including factors like obesity and environmental exposures to poor air and toxic waste, shift over time and across geographic locations. Climate-related events influence people’s exposure to cancer risks and access to cancer care. Our population is aging, and, thus, is more vulnerable to cancer. At the same time, increases in cancer among middle-aged and younger people reflect the impact of evolving risk factors.  Second, though the projects Biden announced funding for last week will employ cool cutting-edge techniques for treatment of cancers, it’s important to remember that solving cancer involves both the front end (prevention and early detection) and the tail end (treatment). “We cannot treat our way out of the rising cancer caseload. The only solution is a full-scale defense, so that nobody suffers the disease in the first place,” Madeline Drexler, editor of Harvard Public Health has written. This year’s data from the American Cancer Society details declines in cancer mortality achieved largely from reductions in lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death, driven by reductions in smoking. Treatment innovations, including immunotherapy, have led to improved survival rates for certain types of cancer. However, several of the most common cancers, including those in the breast, pancreas, liver, kidney and prostate, are increasing in incidence, and need a huge boost in prevention efforts.  Further, a striking emphasis within the ACS data is how much progress is impeded by persistent racial and ethnic health disparities in prevention, access to care and survival rates. For example, rates of uterine corpus cancer, the fourth most common type of cancer among women, have been increasing by about 1% per year overall, but is increasing by more than 2% per year among Black, Hispanic, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women. Alarmingly, survival rates are going down, and within that finding are breathtaking racial disparities: The five-year survival rate for Black women is 63%, but 84% for white women; Black women have more provider visits preceding diagnosis and are less likely to receive appropriate testing; once diagnosed, they are less likely to receive appropriate treatment. As a result, Black women have lower survival rates at every stage of diagnosis. Although this stage of the Moonshot is about funding scientific discoveries, the fight against cancer cannot be just about discoveries. Dazzling scientific successes don’t mean much if we can’t consistently apply them and if we can’t address the systematic and structural barriers that keep a significant proportion of the population from accessing those discoveries. “If all innovation ended today and we could just get people access to the innovations that we know about right now, we think we could reduce cancer mortality by another 20 to 30%,” Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, has said. To be fair, the full agenda of the Cancer Moonshot addresses issues of access, prevention, screening, access to care and health inequities, as well as scientific advances. The treatment innovations themselves should demonstrate that they are consciously designed for a heterogenous population, that studies are performed across a broadly representative population and that outcomes are strong across populations defined by race, ethnicity, rurality, income and location. Further, innovation funding should demonstrate an awareness of how the disparities we see in care are reflected in research commitments, too. One study demonstrated that prostate cancer received an average of $1,821,000 per person-years of life lost. Uterine cancer? Just $57,000.  “Imagine clinical trials that bring innovation to all communities,” said Biden, in his remarks at Tulane. The Cancer Moonshot is like building a rocket; we just need to make sure it can reach every American who needs it."
"In effort to woo women voters, Trump employs blatant racism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-racism-truth-social-post-women-voters-rcna167264,"Here’s a quick follow-up of sorts to a post from last week, when I wrote about Donald Trump’s campaign relying on racist and xenophobic claims that resemble campaign materials from the early 20th century. Trump gave us another example Sunday, when he reshared a social media post with footage of dark-skinned people walking in line. The accompanying text said: “If you’re a woman you can either vote for Trump or wait until one of these monsters goes after you or your daughter.” Trump’s campaign is maniacally focused on anti-immigrant fearmongering, so, much like with that post, the message here seems clear enough, no? In essence: “Women, fear the dark-skinned people” — and not the old white men who want to wield control over your body (and your daughter’s) and keep you in abusive marriages. This was straight-up “Birth of a Nation”-style racism being promoted by the standard-bearer of the Republican Party. And though I don’t plan to report on every racist thing Trump does or says — in part because neither you nor I have the time — I do want to make three observations:"
