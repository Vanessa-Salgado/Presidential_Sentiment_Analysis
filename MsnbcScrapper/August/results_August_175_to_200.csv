DNC video highlights what the election means for holding people accountable for Jan. 6,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 10:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/dnc-january-6-video-trump-election-interference-rcna167787,"Donald Trump’s legal exposure is partly tied to his political success: Winning the presidential election is his best legal strategy for fighting his criminal cases. A haunting video shown at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Wednesday night was a stark reminder of what that means when it comes to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, both for Trump’s own criminal case and Jan. 6 defendants more broadly. The video, which spotlights the Trump-inspired violence of that day, runs just under four minutes and is worth watching: More than serving as a reminder (important in its own right), the video underscores how Trump, if elected, will be empowered not only to crush his own federal election interference case but to pardon the rioters he inspired to storm the Capitol. Specifically, it enumerated the four counts the GOP presidential nominee is charged with in his Washington, D.C., indictment: conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy against rights, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding. (Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrong-doing.) Now, I began this post by noting that Trump’s legal exposure is partly tied to his political success, because the Supreme Court has already given him a head start. In Trump v. United States last month, the Republican-appointed majority rendered at least some of Trump’s conduct immune from prosecution; the extent of that immunity is still being litigated and won’t likely be fully resolved before the election. In another Jan. 6–related ruling this past term, Fischer v. United States, the court narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants, which could affect the obstruction-related counts against Trump, too. As with the immunity issue, the extent to which it does so remains to be seen. So if Trump loses in November, it’s still an open question what will be left of his Jan. 6–related indictment. If he wins, we may never know the answer. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

I worked for Kamala Harris. Here’s the biggest difference between her and Trump.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-california-attorney-general-katie-porter-rcna167229,"What kind of president would Kamala Harris be? That’s a question many Americans are rightly asking themselves since the vice president became our presumptive Democratic nominee. As the only member of Congress who’s worked for Kamala Harris, I can provide some insight. We’ve already seen Donald Trump’s record as president. He let the ultrawealthy off the hook for paying their fair share in taxes. He weakened our international alliances. He proposed cuts to Social Security. In a second Trump term, he would do all this again. The Biden-Harris administration has cracked down on tax cheats, restored our global standing and protected Social Security. Vice President Harris would continue this work, while bringing her own leadership style. We can look to her record of public service — a record I have observed up close — to see how she works for the people. Kamala Harris took office as California’s attorney general in 2011, during the long, painful aftermath of the Great Recession. At the time, attorneys general from 49 states were negotiating with the nation’s largest banks, demanding that these institutions take responsibility for their role in the foreclosure crisis. Kamala spent months pushing for a better deal, channeling the pain she’d heard from families on the campaign trail. When the banks refused to do enough, she pulled out of the talks, which threatened to derail the compromise because of California’s size. This angered the bankers. It annoyed other attorneys general, some of whom had been in office for decades. But it was the right thing for her constituents — and it worked. She got the banks to promise more than quadruple what they initially offered to help Californians. That’s someone who can’t be bought or bullied. Now, think about Kamala bringing this tenacity to a high-level international meeting like the G7. She won’t go along to get along; she’ll do what’s right for Americans and for a safer, more peaceful world. Kamala knows that respect is not something one can petulantly demand, as Trump does. Respect comes from the moral authority of doing what’s right and speaking truth to power. Kamala was savvy to press the big banks to do more, but her most remarkable insight guided her next move. She understood that the settlement depended on the banks’ promises to change their unlawful practices — and that given their illegal conduct, it wasn’t enough just to hope that they shaped up. For Kamala, the victory wasn’t the words on the pages of the National Mortgage Settlement or the press conference announcing the deal. Families were counting on government to deliver actual help that improved their lives. Over objections from the big banks, Kamala appointed me as an independent watchdog for the settlement. She empowered me to hold the banks’ feet to the fire and to get results for Californians. I had no formal legal authority, but I had Kamala’s force of will behind me. With her backing, we halted hundreds of foreclosures and forced the banks to consider families for loan modifications. We were able to get one family a six-figure compensation check from one major bank for its flawed processes. We caught another major bank forcing consumers to sign away their right to sue for legal violations —breaking a promise it had made in the settlement — and we forced it to send out hundreds of thousands of correction letters. We successfully pressed the banks to work more to reach the hardest-hit communities, and we held workshops for service members and seniors. We changed lives on the ground. That’s how Kamala is: She sees things through, not stopping until people get help, because she cares about our families. When she called me to offer me the job as California monitor, I had a 2-month-old. Like many working moms, I had to bring my infant to work because she had nowhere else to go. I remember being embarrassed on the call, worrying if Betsy would cry or fuss while I was talking to the attorney general. I nervously confessed that I had my baby with me. Kamala didn’t hesitate. She asked how my baby and I were doing and how her siblings were adjusting. She wasn’t making small talk; she genuinely wanted to know. And then she continued to tell me about how important it was that Californians have a watchdog and a place to report any continued bank misconduct. I had a newborn, two other kids and a full-time job as a college professor. Kamala did not even blink; she expressed confidence in me to do the job and emphasized the importance of the work. This is how I know, very personally, that Americans can count on Kamala to fill her administration with the best, most qualified leaders from all walks of life to advocate for everyday Americans. There couldn’t be a clearer contrast with Donald Trump. As I exposed in congressional hearings, his appointees included a housing secretary who didn’t know basic real estate terms and a postmaster general who didn’t know how much it costs to mail a postcard. I can assure Americans from personal experience: Kamala Harris’ vision for moving America forward will not just be words on a convention stage or at a press conference. Nor will it be the empty promises and lip service that we hear from too many politicians who pose as leaders. Kamala will do what’s right and go to the mat to get it done."
Trump pushes unconstitutional punishment for flag-burning at DNC protests,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-punishment-dnc-protests-rcna167749,"While Democrats seek to reclaim the mantle of “freedom” from Republicans this election season, the GOP’s presidential nominee pushed for an unconstitutional punishment for those who exercise their freedom in a way he dislikes — that is, by burning the American flag.  Citing such behavior by protesters outside the Israeli consulate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, Donald Trump called for Congress to pass a law mandating a year in jail for anyone who protests in that manner.  The legal problem with that proposal is that it violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court addressed the issue in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson, when conservative icon Antonin Scalia joined the high court majority in deciding that a conviction for burning the flag was unconstitutional. This isn’t the first time that the former president has advocated for such an unconstitutional punishment. Just last month, Trump did so after people burned flags while protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Washington, D.C., congressional address. And in 2016, as president-elect, he suggested that flag-burners be stripped of their citizenship. It’s unsurprising that the man who flouted his constitutional oath the first time around should lack the understanding, appreciation or both of the law and the freedoms it secures.

Trump targets Shapiro as a ‘highly overrated Jewish Governor’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:14 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-shapiro-highly-overrated-jewish-governor-rcna167780,"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention were very well received, though Donald Trump was apparently unimpressed. The Wall Street Journal reported: Even for Trump, who peddles antisemitic tropes as a matter of course, this was bizarre. In a middle-of-the-night tirade, the GOP candidate began by arguing, “The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech.” Whether Trump understands this or not, the fact that he emphasized the governor’s faith was itself emblematic of his prejudice: When the former president lashes out at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he doesn’t call him a “highly overrated Lutheran governor.” When Trump whines about House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, he doesn’t call her a “highly overrated Catholic congresswoman.” But when targeting Shapiro, the Republican apparently finds it necessary to call out the governor’s religion — which says quite a bit about Trump, and none of it’s good. In the same online missive, Trump added, “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close.” In other words, as far as the GOP candidate is concerned, in the history of Israel, no other human being — in the United States or abroad — has ever done more for the country than him, which is unintentionally hilarious. In case that weren’t quite enough, the former president went on to say that Vice President Kamala Harris “hates Israel and will do nothing but make its journey through the complexities of survival as difficult as possible, hoping in the end that it will fail.” To the extent that reality still has any meaning, there’s literally no evidence of the Democratic presidential hopeful “hating” Israel, but this sentence stood out for me for an entirely different reason: While Trump habitually publishes angry screeds to his social media platform in the middle of the night, it’s difficult to believe that it was his hands that wrote that Israel is making “its journey through the complexities of survival.” In other words, Trump didn’t just peddle offensive nonsense, he also might’ve had some help putting this one together. For a politician who’s a little too eager to falsely accuse his opponents of antisemitism, this was ridiculous. Indeed, Trump's rhetoric was so ugly that a White House spokesperson condemned his missive, saying, “It is Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” Shapiro himself wasn't impressed with Trump's nonsense, either. “I mean, first off, I think it’s clear over the last few years, Donald Trump is obsessed with me and obsessed with continuing to spew hate and division in our politics,"" the governor said. ""He’s someone who has routinely peddled antisemitic tropes like this. Look, remember, he’s the guy who wanted Doug Mastriano to have his job. He’s the guy who has been repeatedly rejected by the voters of Pennsylvania. He himself lost in 2020, all of his handpicked candidates have lost, and I think he’s heading for another loss — this time to Kamala Harris. ""I think you all heard me talk last night at the DNC — the exact polar opposite of what Donald Trump is talking about. I’m talking about real freedom, bringing people together, accepting folks no matter what they look like, where they come from, who they love, who they pray to and saying, 'This is a place for you.' That’s diametrically opposed to everything Donald Trump believes, and it’s clear that he’s going to continue to be the hateful, divisive person that he’s always been in this campaign. And I think given his track record, it’s clear he’s setting himself up for another defeat.”"
"Why Trump pointed to a made-up meeting between Harris, Putin",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 7:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pointed-made-meeting-harris-putin-rcna167762,"Almost immediately after Russia’s Vladimir Putin launched an invasion into Ukraine, Donald Trump has tried to blame the war on the Biden administration. The line has never made sense — even John Bolton, Trump’s former White House national security advisor, didn’t buy it — but the former president has peddled the line in recent years anyway. In a speech in North Carolina devoted to national security, however, the Republican added a new chapter to his weird story. This was the anecdote the GOP candidate shared with supporters: At that point, Trump turned to retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and asked, “Did you know that, general?” Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Cameras didn’t capture Kellogg’s response, but I have a hunch he wasn’t familiar the story about the Harris-Putin meeting — because it only happened in Trump’s overactive imagination. Let’s briefly review a handful of pertinent details. First, Trump still doesn’t pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris’ name correctly. Second, Harris didn’t meet with Putin ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Trump, whose relationship with reality is often fractured, appears to have simply made this up. Third, the Democratic vice president, shortly before the war began, did attend the 2022 Munich Security Conference, representing the Biden administration. Trump would apparently have people believe that the vice president’s efforts were somehow a failure, but reality suggests otherwise: Harris met with officials from U.S. allies — not with Russia’s authoritarian leader — and helped solidify the Western alliance, which has been steadfast in its opposition to Moscow’s aggression. And finally, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that if anyone should avoid talking about private and undisclosed chats with Putin, it’s the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Remember this Politico report from June 2019? Months earlier, The Washington Post reported that Trump went to “extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations” with the Russian autocrat — at one point even “taking possession” of his own interpreter’s notes after a conversation with Putin. It’s a dynamic, in other words, in which Trump has to make up an imaginary conversation between Harris and Putin, while Democrats can reference actual conversations between Trump and Putin."
Trump’s odd pitch: ‘Our primary focus is not to get out the vote’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-primary-focus-not-get-out-vote-election-2024-rcna167743,"Election Day 2024 is still 11 weeks away, which might seem like a long while, but early voting in some states will begin in less than a month. Common sense suggests the major party presidential nominees would be laser focused right now on get-out-the-vote strategies and pursuing as many votes as possible. Indeed, it’s how democracies work: The more votes a campaign gets, the greater the chance of success. With this in mind, it’s curious to see Donald Trump consistently downplay the need for votes as part of his Republican candidacy. NBC News reported: “We have all the votes we’ll need,” Trump added, pointing to yard signs as proof of his popularity. As a video excerpt of his remarks made clear, the former president wasn’t kidding. I’ve studied campaigns for quite a while, and I honestly can’t think of another example in which a candidate, less than a month before voters start casting ballots in a competitive race, said out loud, “Our primary focus is not to get out the vote.” If the message sounds familiar, it’s not your imagination. As we discussed roughly a month ago, the GOP candidate peddled the same line on Fox News in late July. “My instruction: We don’t need the votes, I have so many votes,” Trump said. It wasn’t a mistake. The day after June’s presidential debate, for example, the former president held a rally in Virginia and told attendees, “We don’t need votes.” A week earlier, the Republican spoke at a far-right conference and said roughly the same thing. “I tell my people, I don’t need any votes,” said Trump, who added: “We don’t need the votes.” That came on heels of the GOP candidate pushing the same line during an appearance in Detroit. “Listen, we don’t need votes,” Trump said. He added: “We don’t need votes. We have to stop — focus, don’t worry about votes.” In fact, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the former president has been pushing this line since last fall, during his party’s primary process. “You don’t have to vote,” Trump told a New Hampshire audience in October. “Don’t worry about voting. The voting — we got plenty of votes.” As best as I can tell, Trump isn’t literally telling Americans not to cast ballots. He’s instead suggesting that he’s so wildly popular, receiving support from voters will be effortless as Election Day nears. The real challenge, the former president invariably adds, is dealing with cheating and electoral fraud that definitely exist in his weird imagination, despite Trump’s inability to substantiate his conspiracy theories with evidence. In other words, every time the Republican downplays the need for votes, he’s necessarily emphasizing the need for voter intimidation tactics and voting restrictions. Given the volume and repetition of his anti-election rhetoric — Trump asked earlier this week, “Why are we having an election?” — and after his years long antipathy toward democracy, it’s tough not to find the comments unsettling. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Walz, Democrats claim the mantle of ‘freedom’ at convention",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 5:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/walz-democrats-claim-mantle-freedom-convention-rcna167734,"Republicans haven’t exactly been subtle in claiming the idea of “freedom” as their own. When a group of right-wing GOP House members decided to create their own radical faction, for example, they called it the House Freedom Caucus. When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was preparing to launch an ill-fated national campaign, he labeled his state “a citadel of freedom,” “freedom’s linchpin” and “freedom’s vanguard.” He went on to title his memoir “The Courage to Be Free” and called his budget a “Framework for Freedom.” But if “freedom” is a word that Republicans stole from Democrats, the Harris/Walz campaign and its allies are stealing it back. In fact, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted his party’s vice presidential nomination, he explicitly said that “freedom” is “what this election is about.” From the transcript: The Minnesotan was hardly alone. Earlier in the evening, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro emphasized a similar message, explaining Donald Trump “cloaks himself in the blanket of freedom, what he’s offering isn’t freedom at all.” “It’s not freedom to tell our children what books they’re allowed to read,” he added. “And it’s not freedom to tell women what they can do with their bodies. It sure as hell isn’t freedom to say, ‘You can go vote, but he gets to pick the winner.’ That’s not freedom.” Soon after, convention attendees were presented with a new video from the Harris campaign. It’s title: “We believe in freedom.” It dovetails with a convention in which Beyonce’s “Freedom” has been a musical mainstay of the entire event, and as Walz ended his convention remarks, it was Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” that played over the loudspeakers. All of which is to say, Democrats aren’t just trying to change the public conversation, they’re also picking a fight over the mantle of “freedom” itself. As the ongoing convention is helping prove, it’s a fight the party thinks it can win."
Tim Walz’s communal patriotism is a striking contrast to Trump's individualism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 5:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walzs-dnc-speech-was-powerfully-patriotic-sincere-rcna167373,"“We’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason — we love this country,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at the beginning of his convention speech Wednesday night. He clearly means it — it turns out you can be a skilled politician carrying out a strategy to win an election and also be sincere. In his speech, Walz showed why he offers Democrats an opportunity to reclaim patriotism, and perhaps help redefine it along the way.  For as long as I’ve been writing about politics, I’ve argued against the idea that some of us are “real” Americans and the rest of us are something else, or that some American places are more American than others. Those are pernicious ideas in a country as large and varied as ours, and one built on its ability to constantly remake and renew itself. But let’s be honest: If we put a thousand voters in a mind-reading machine and asked them to picture a “patriotic American,” certain kinds of people would come to mind. They’d look more like Walz than Vice President Kamala Harris: rural rather than urban, from the country’s middle rather than the coasts, male rather than female, and yes, probably white.  Problematic as it might be, the fact that Walz “codes” as the kind of person you just know has a flag flying from their porch means that when he talks about patriotism, he might be able to convince some people who haven’t been too open to Democrats to listen. Which is why Walz’s framing of patriotism as community is so important.  The Harris campaign has put the word “freedom” at the heart of its campaign, and Walz even sometimes describes the campaign ethos as “mind your own damn business.” But he also talks frequently about the nation as a web of commitments and obligations of care. “The family down the road — they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do, they may not love like you do, but they’re your neighbors. And you look out for them, just like they do for you,” he said in his speech. “Everybody belongs, and everybody has a responsibility to contribute.” It’s a striking contrast with the Republican ticket, whose understanding of patriotism doesn’t have much to do with neighborliness. Walz’s counterpart, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said in his convention speech that “the source of American greatness” can be found where his family is from in Kentucky, not because it represents American ideals, but because it “is our homeland. People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home.” But Vance doesn’t have much to say about what it means to live in that home. The contrast is even more stark when we consider what Donald Trump has to say about patriotism. He has a schtick he does in which he literally hugs and kisses an American flag, which always gets a laugh from the MAGA faithful. It’s supposed to communicate that he loves his country but his brand of patriotism is utterly hollow. America is our team, we hate all the other teams, and that’s about as deep as it goes. Trump substitutes nationalism for patriotism, insisting that love for America is found in fear and animosity toward the rest of the world.   Think about it this way: What exactly is it about America that Donald Trump loves? Have we ever heard him speak about the extraordinary diversity of our places and people, or our amazing achievements in science and culture, or the majesty of our national parks? Of course not. If you asked him why it is that people across the world dream of coming here, his only answer would be that we have to keep them out.  And when he isn’t in power, he can’t help but describe the country in ways that drip with contempt. As far as Trump’s concerned, this is a land of mayhem and misery, full of losers and suckers who are worthy of nothing but scorn. And he has a particular affection for those who committed treason against America so they could keep other Americans enslaved. That Trump can say the things he does and still claim to be patriotic only reminds liberals of how long they have been targeted with accusations of insufficient patriotism. It was particularly acute in the years following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and into the Iraq War, when anyone who raised questions about the unfolding disaster of American foreign policy was liable to be told they hated America and were siding with “the terrorists.”  Which makes it all the more heartening to see an all-American guy like Tim Walz make a plea for a different kind of patriotism. At the end of his speech, Walz implored Democrats to work hard in the remaining time before the election. “That’s how we make America a place where no child is left hungry,” he said. “Where no community is left behind. Where nobody gets told they don’t belong.” If he and Harris keep emphasizing that this vision of inclusiveness, care and common fate is at the heart of patriotism, they might just convince a few people that it’s about more than whether you hug a flag."
Kamala Harris made me feel seen when no one else looked,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-made-feel-seen-no-one-else-looked-rcna167341,"My wife Diana and I met Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff in the summer of 2015, when Harris and I were both preparing to run for Senate. And by preparing to run, I mean traveling the country fundraising, because the amount of money it takes to run for the U.S. Senate requires you to spend more than a year flying around gathering up cash, like a marathoner accepting little cups of water from strangers. Harris won her Senate race and I got a silver medal in mine, but we stayed in touch and I would visit her sometimes during trips to D.C. We were friends, but not super close, which is common for friendships in politics.  Despite losing that Senate race, my political profile continued to grow and for a time I was among the couple of dozen Democrats preparing to make a 2020 run for the presidency. But in the latter half of 2018, I dropped out of the 2020 presidential mix, and then out of public life for a while, to go to the VA to seek therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. I’d been putting it off since serving in Afghanistan with the Army over a decade earlier, and it caught up to me rather abruptly.  Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Just like that, I went from what the political world cynically calls a “bold faced name” to a vet with no job other than growing a beard, going to therapy, and trying to learn how to be useful around the house. When I first made the announcement, it seemed like everybody I knew, famous or otherwise, reached out. But after a while, most of those calls tapered off as people went on with their lives and I disappeared from their televisions and their social media feeds. Kamala Harris was one in a small group of people in the political world who continued to call. In fact, she checked in on me with some regularity. She would sometimes call just to catch up, or sometimes she had a big speech or meeting coming up with a veterans’ or national security group and I’d be a sounding board. I don’t know how much she actually needed my advice about that stuff when she asked for it, and I don’t know how much I helped, but her asking made me feel valuable at a time when I’d sort of given the world permission to forget about me. And I appreciated that gesture a lot.   I remember answering her call one day while pushing a cart through Costco. This was well after she was headlong into the 2020 campaign, and she had her veterans' policy person on the line because she wanted to run some language by me. Once that was done, she thanked that person and then politely asked that they go ahead and drop off the line so we could catch up.   As usual, she expressed genuine interest in how my mental health was coming along. By that point I was truly into a post-traumatic growth chapter and had moved on to a role as an executive at a national veterans nonprofit. At some point, I mentioned that I was thinking about doing some TV surrogate stuff for the campaign. It was kind of a big-deal decision for me at the time because I’d been out of the mix for almost two years by then.   She was clearly excited for me, because she spent a couple minutes describing in great detail how to set up my home office to make cable hits easy and comfortable. I still use the ring light she suggested.   My point in sharing this admittedly uneventful and humdrum anecdote is that I’m excited about the prospect of a Kamala Harris presidency not just because she’s brilliant and skilled and hardworking and believes in the right things. I’m also excited because, in my experience, she’s a downright decent person who shows people respect and makes sure they feel seen. And I’m not trying to do some humblebrag “I’m friends with the next president” flex here because I’ll be the first to tell you we’re not close friends. At best, we’re friendly acquaintances who used to work in the same field. And that’s my point. She is the type of person who is thoughtful enough to treat a peer like a peer, even when that person has bowed out and is no longer really a peer at all. And that’s the kind of everyday decency I believe she’ll bring to the presidency. "
The Republican attack on Tim Walz over Tiananmen Square is almost unbelievable,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-china-trip-tiananmen-ron-johnson-rcna167552,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s meteoric rise and his aptitude for putting down Republicans is driving the GOP crazy and has it scrambling desperately to find comebacks. By far the funniest attempt to take down Walz has come from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.  In an interview this week with Fox Business, Johnson warned that Walz is a “radical leftist” and made the case by pointing out what he called Walz’s “strange” relationship with China. “He got married on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square. He’s gone to China. He’s taught in China. He’s got deep connections to China,” Johnson said in the interview. I had to listen to the interview twice to make sure I wasn’t mishearing it, because I couldn’t believe Johnson had pointed to Walz’s remembrance of the Tiananmen Square massacre as evidence that he could be some kind of Manchurian candidate. Johnson seems unaware that he scored an own goal. Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Johnson is right about the basic fact: Walz did choose the date of the incident for his marriage. But the 1989 incident, during which Chinese troops opened fire on and killed hundreds — possibly thousands — of peaceful protesters in Beijing who were calling for political reforms, is an event that the Chinese Communist Party loathes anybody mentioning. The government has aggressively sought to suppress information about the protests and the Communist Party’s crackdown in China; even so, the event remains one of the most iconic reference points for human rights criticism of Beijing. Walz has said the date “will always have a lot of bitter memories for the people”; his choice to make it the date of his wedding anniversary is clearly an homage to the victims. Walz’s act of remembrance is an act of rebellion against the Chinese government’s agenda to conceal its murderous repression. In other words, Johnson, a China hawk like most members of his party, ought to be encouraged by Walz’s symbolic gesture, not suspicious of it. Either he’s illiterate about Chinese history or he’s just throwing anything at the wall to see what’ll stick. Maybe it’s both. The GOP has gone all in trying to peddle conspiracy theories that Walz’s many trips to China — first to teach English, and then as a teacher escorting American students on cultural exchange visits — have compromised him somehow. House Republicans are investigating Walz for ties to China, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has hysterically accused Walz of having been covertly co-opted by China, posting on X that Walz is an example of how “Beijing patiently grooms future American leaders.” But, again, the GOP has gotten everything exactly upside down. Walz’s background and record on China are not liabilities but strengths. There’s nothing known about Walz’s trips there that suggest anything unseemly. His comments on the record — many of which were documented in local papers long before he expressed any political ambitions — show that he has consistently expressed affection for the Chinese people and criticism of their government. “If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what [Chinese people] could accomplish,” he told the Alliance Star-Herald in Nebraska in 1990. Walz also speaks Mandarin. This kind of background is not a warning sign. It’s reflective of the kind of cosmopolitan, critically engaged sensibility one wants in a politician who can influence international affairs. As my colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim has pointed out, Walz’s congressional record suggests he’s far from a pushover when it comes to pointing out China’s problems: Walz also opposes China’s expansion in the South China Sea but has expressed optimism about “areas of cooperation that we can work on,” and believes the U.S.-Chinese relationship doesn't necessarily need ""to be an adversarial relationship.” As Paul Musgrave, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, puts it, Walz’s record is “that of a measured critic of the Chinese Communist Party—prone neither to exaggeration nor accommodation.” In Musgrave's assessment, Walz is a moderate who defies the categories of ""hawk"" and ""dove"" on China, and approaches the issue as ""a student and a teacher."" Republicans, frantic to find a vulnerability in Walz’s armor as an affable happy warrior from the Midwest, have decided that his China affiliations are a path to taking him down. But the more one learns about those affiliations, the more one realizes that it’s a good thing that someone with his background could soon become the vice president. "
Oprah Winfrey’s DNC speech was a surprise masterclass in patriotism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/oprah-winfrey-dnc-speech-democratic-convention-rcna167688,"Who better to bring home the meaning of E Pluribus Unum than Oprah? The one-name wonder is her own economic force, a woman who can move company stock prices simply by placing car keys under chairs or mentioning a book title or creating a Christmas list.  At the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, back in her hometown of Chicago, Oprah tried to move the American public toward unity in democracy. She spoke about the people who seek to rule, “who seek to divide and then conquer.” Her advice to us wasn’t the pablum we hear about rugged individualism and raising yourself up by your bootstraps. She told us that we are neighbors — and we don’t ask if our neighbors have citizenship or if they married the way we think they should be or if they are “childless cat ladies.” When the house is on fire, we go ahead and rescue the cat, too. Oprah quoted the late, great Congressman John Lewis — “no matter what ship our ancestors arrived on, we are all in the same boat now.” And she hammered that point home by connecting our power to vote our values, that “democracy and respect are the ballot.” Democrats, Never Trumpers and experts on authoritarianism have tried for the entire Trump era to warn the American people that the entire American experiment is at stake. While polls show Americans are broadly worried about threats to our democracy, democracy as an issue barely appears on lists of voter priorities this election. This is what made Oprah’s surprise DNC appearance so valuable: She has claimed her pride in being American, and in her only-Oprah-can-do-it way, she made the Constitution relatable and real again. Her storytelling, charisma and sense of optimism are her superpowers in her role of healer-in-chief. Her message is simple: The choice in November is to choose loyalty to the Constitution, rather than loyalty to any individual. There is no going back to a time of division and darkness — it is time to choose joy."
Tim Walz’s emotional defense of fertility treatments matters to IVF babies like me,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 6:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-ivf-dnc-daughter-hope-wife-gwen-rcna167590,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s Midwestern dad energy is hard to miss. Memes and social media posts — some silly, some earnest — have proliferated as online progressives celebrate “America’s dad.” Walz reminds me of my dad, too. But in a different way.  Walz has spoken candidly about his family’s experience with assisted reproductive technologies, more commonly known as fertility treatments. Walz and his wife, Gwen, had their daughter, Hope, through intrauterine insemination (IUI) in 2001, after seven years of trying to have children. (Although Walz has sometimes used “IVF” as a catch-all term to refer to the fertility treatments his family went through, IUI is less invasive and less expensive than IVF, and it is often a first option for families struggling to conceive.)  Since 1978, over 10 million children globally are believed to have been born as a result of assisted reproductive technologies, according to the National Institutes of Health. I am one of those 10 million, as is my brother. When my parents got married in 1996, they knew they wanted to start a family. When they had trouble conceiving naturally, they decided to pursue fertility treatments. They started with IUI and then tried IVF. They were devastated when the first treatments failed. But after the second round of IVF, they were pregnant — with twins. My brother and I arrived in August 2000. We wouldn’t exist without IVF. And when I hear Walz speak about the importance of access to fertility treatment, it reminds me of my own parents.  My dad is the most emotive person I know. He’s never been the stoic macho type. In fact, when I called him to check some facts for this essay, he cried. I see the same raw emotion from Walz. “I’m not crying, you’re crying,” Walz said at an Arizona rally after the crowd began chanting his daughter’s name.  My parents describe their IVF experience as deeply trying, even as it led to the ultimate reward. And they’ve always expressed gratitude for the science that gave them their family.  As a teenager, I would joke about being a “test tube baby” and a GMO. But, deep down, I took pride in it, knowing the lengths my parents went to start their family. The method of our conception was never hidden from us — it was a part of our family’s story.  Those who have gone through fertility treatments like IVF share a special connection. Gwen Walz has spoken about the community assistance she received during her fertility process, sharing recently about a neighbor who assisted her with her IUI treatments. When my parents were going through the process, my mom developed a similar community of women at her doctor’s appointments and on an early internet message board. They shared the highs and lows, the ups and downs. And when my mom became pregnant, she gave her unused medicine, worth over $2,000, to another woman struggling to pay for the treatments.   “Having this community of women was a lifeline for me,” my mom told me. “It was so validating to share my feelings and know others were feeling the same way. I didn’t know them well, but I felt like we were really close friends because we were going through such an intense experience together.”  Walz is talking about fertility treatments on the campaign trail for a reason: IVF in particular is under attack by some conservatives. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally considered children, forcing many reproductive clinics to halt treatment in fear of legal challenges. And while most Republicans haven’t publicly endorsed an IVF ban, over 100 Republicans in Congress signed the Life at Conception Act, which claims legal protections for human beings should begin at “the moment of fertilization.” After the Alabama ruling, Walz posted on Facebook: “Gwen and I have two beautiful children because of reproductive health care like IVF. This issue is deeply personal to our family and so many others. Don’t let these guys get away with this by telling you they support IVF when their handpicked judges oppose it. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions are clear. They’re bringing anti-science government into your exam room, bedroom, and classroom.” Walz calls out their hypocrisy for what it is. How can a party that claims to believe in the sanctity of the family deny someone who wants a child? That’s another part of my father that I see in Walz — a sense of righteous anger about what he deems to be unjust and cruel. Walz is reminding voters that reproductive rights are a men’s issue, too, as Faith Hill wrote in The Atlantic. But the way he speaks about this topic matters, too. He’s demonstrating a kind of masculinity that couldn’t be more different from the Trump-Vance machismo brand. Hope Walz and I may not have much in common, life-wise. But we both have parents who went to great lengths to achieve their dream of starting a family. And there are hundreds of thousands of Americans, like Hope and me, born through assisted reproductive technologies. We all see a piece of our own families in Tim Walz. And Walz carries a piece of all of us in his and Kamala Harris’ fight for reproductive rights."
Eric Holder takes MSNBC inside Kamala Harris' VP vetting process,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 4:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/eric-holder-vice-president-barack-obama-tim-walz-rcna167641,"Former Attorney General Eric Holder sat down with MSNBC's Symone Sanders-Townsend for his first interview since he was selected to lead Vice President Kamala Harris' vice presidential vetting process. Wednesday's interview was part of an MSNBC Live event at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Holder joined two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, MSNBC Live co-host and creative director Luke Russert, and co-host of ""The Weekend"" Symone Sanders-Townsend for a conversation focused on voting and the 2024 election. Holder pulled back the curtain on Harris' vetting process and explained how it compared to his previous experience screening running mates for former President Barack Obama in 2008: ""We had about two and a half, three months to do that. This one took 15 days."" Holder said he convened a team of about 70 lawyers from his firm, Covington & Burling, to help with the effort. According to the former attorney general, they worked around the clock, whittling down a list of about 11 candidates to Harris' final pick, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Holder said his team's research involved watching hours of videos of the candidates, telling Sanders-Townsend he looked at more videos than he's ever seen in his life. ""My YouTube hours are off the charts now,"" he said. Holder admitted there were some positives about the accelerated timeline. ""It was daunting, but the time was so short that you didn’t have time to get too anxious about it,"" he said. ""It was only at the conclusion that you said, 'I hope we got everything.' And I think we did."" Holder said it helped that Harris had ""the great ability to pick from a wide range of really qualified people."" When asked why the governor ultimately got the job, Holder explained it came down to Walz's accomplishments and his chemistry with Harris. He said the pair ""just kind of clicked."" As for his experience, Holder ticked through the governor's resume, noting his time in the military, in Congress and his tenure as a teacher. In the end, Holder said he was confident Walz would be ""a great vice president."" During the conversation, Sanders-Townsend also asked the former attorney general about rumors he could join a possible Harris administration as her chief of staff. But Holder quickly shut the speculation down, ""I’ve had a good career in government and I'm pretty satisfied with the things I've done."" He then promised to do everything in his power to ""make sure that, in fact, Kamala Harris will pick a White House chief of staff."""
"RFK Jr. plans to drop bid for president and endorse Trump, sources tell NBC News",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 2:24 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 21, 2024, 3:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-to-drop-presidential-race-trump-rcna167602,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a scion of the Kennedy political dynasty whose independent presidential bid was bankrolled by his running mate and dogged by humiliating personal revelations, will drop out of the race and endorse Donald Trump for president, NBC News reports. Two sources familiar with the plans told NBC News that talks between the two campaigns are underway. Kennedy announced earlier that he will hold a news conference in Phoenix on Friday. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally outside Phoenix the same day. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told NBC News on Wednesday that there has been “a lot of communication back and forth” between Kennedy and the GOP campaign. The end of Kennedy’s bid for president, culminating in an endorsement for Trump, is not entirely unexpected. His running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said in a podcast interview released Tuesday that their campaign was considering exiting the race to help Trump. Later that day, Trump said he would be open to offering Kennedy a role in his administration, though Vance separately suggested that a potential Cabinet position would not be contingent on Kennedy backing the former president. Despite his long odds from the outset, Kennedy had worked hard to be seen as a serious contender. He fought to get his name on state ballots (though his methods have drawn scrutiny) and to appear onstage at the June debate. To voters unhappy with the major-party options, he pitched himself as a leader who would reject corporate influence on politics, a position buttressed by his conspiratorial view of the world. Yet his campaign never really took off. He consistently flailed in the polls and struggled to raise money, relying heavily on Shanahan, a philanthropist and former Silicon Valley lawyer, to fund his campaign. His political agenda also had little impact: As a third-party contender, he put forward a platform that was too haphazard for him to be a movement candidate, and his campaign was too weak for him to be a spoiler. What Kennedy’s candidacy did do was raise his national profile — and deeply damage his already questionable reputation in the public eye. His conspiracy beliefs gained intense scrutiny, and he was publicly snubbed by other Kennedys, with 15 of his family members — including six of his 10 siblings — publicly endorsing Joe Biden before the president dropped out. There were also a series of disturbing disclosures from his past. Kennedy told The New York Times that he had bounced back from the cognitive effects of a parasitic worm eating part of his brain. After a woman who used to babysit his children accused him of sexual assault, saying he had groped her and touched her inappropriately on separate occasions, Kennedy said in response: “I am who I am.” Asked by The Boston Globe whether more women would come forward with sexual misconduct allegations, he said: “We’ll see what happens.” Kennedy also had to deny to Vanity Fair that he once ate a dog and, most recently, revealed that he once dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park as a bizarre joke."
Here’s how Democrats have changed since the Bill Clinton era,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 2:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democratic-party-dnc-bill-clinton-era-changes-rcna166669,"It was a different electorate when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton accepted his party’s nomination on behalf of the forgotten middle class in 1992. There was no Blue Wall. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voted red. Democrats had lost three straight presidential elections. The electorate was 88% white, and there weren’t enough Hispanics voting to even show up in the exit polls. “I am a product of America’s middle class. And when I am your president, you will be forgotten no more,” Clinton said to thunderous applause. He wasn’t expected to win against President George H.W. Bush, a Greatest Generation decorated veteran. America’s love for youth and change carried Clinton and Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee, two baby boomers from the South, to the White House. When Clinton addresses the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, it will be with the expectation that another unlikely standard-bearer will be victorious, because Vice President Kamala Harris represents the America of today and the future just as Clinton did in his time. In the three decades since Clinton was first elected, enormous demographic and culture shifts have taken place that dictate how campaigns are run and where they find their voters.  Still, one thing remains true: “What you stand for really matters,” says Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which helped Clinton hone his message to win back working-class white voters, dubbed Reagan Democrats. The Rev. Jesse Jackson mocked the DLC as “Democrats for the Leisure Class” for defying liberal orthodoxy with a pro-business, trade-friendly agenda and, on cultural issues, promising to “end welfare as we know it” and put 100,000 cops on the streets, policies that addressed the anxieties of the 1980s and ’90s.   When Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020, the electorate was 20 points less white than in the Clinton era. Diverse groups are the core of the party’s support. Yet a central focus of the Harris-Walz ticket is to reach those same white voters without college degrees whom the DLC identified in 1992. Harris needs to win enough of their votes to get close to where Biden was with this group in 2020.  Clinton left office with a 66% approval rating after having created almost 23 million jobs and left a budget surplus that his successor, Bush, blew through with tax cuts for the rich. Clinton’s policies created a dream economy, but not everybody benefited, which led in part to the populist uprising we see today that is fueled by the resentments of those left behind. “It’s hard to make judgments about the validity of policy when you’re assessing it against a reality that’s 30 years later,” From told me. “We set an agenda for the 1990s. It wasn’t an agenda for 2020.” Trade was a big part of Clinton’s message, and it meant taking on the unions. Ross Perot, the populist billionaire from Texas, had warned during the 1992 presidential campaign that free trade would create a “giant sucking sound” as American manufacturing jobs fled across the border to Mexico. And in 1993, Perot and Vice President Al Gore held a joint TV appearance to debate the merits of NAFTA — the free-trade agreement Clinton negotiated. Clinton championed Most Favored Nation trading access for China, comparing its historic significance to President Richard Nixon’s opening of China. The glow faded when China flooded markets with cheap exports, and if there’s one thing that Democrats and Republicans agree on today, it is the threat that China’s trade practices pose to markets and the global economy. “It is a legitimate criticism that the people designing the Clinton program ... we didn’t see how serious the impact would be on non-college workers,” says Robert Shapiro, who was Clinton’s principal economic adviser during the ’92 campaign. Trade wasn’t the only culprit. “Most of the jobs lost were not to trade but technology, but the number of workers fell sharply.”  The ’90s were sharply partisan, with Republican rabble-rouser Newt Gingrich ascending to speaker of the House and cultural issues getting more weaponized. During the 1992 campaign, Clinton had responded “yes” to a question about gays’ serving in the military. The issue took on an energy all its own and consumed much of the early months of his presidency. Opposed were the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sam Nunn, the Democratic senator from Georgia who chaired the powerful Armed Services Committee. Faced with their firepower, Clinton backed down, signing compromise legislation dubbed “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which allowed gay people in the military if they followed a code of silence. It wasn’t something Clinton was proud of, and he would compound his anger and embarrassment when, in 1996, in the middle of his re-election campaign, he reluctantly signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had passed both chambers of Congress with big bipartisan majorities. To signal his displeasure, he signed the bill alone in the White House after midnight on a Friday with no cameras present. Clinton did what he had to as a politician navigating an intensifying conservative climate that would challenge the country. The Senate repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell” in 2010. The Supreme Court struck down DOMA in 2013 in a 5-4 ruling. The cultural issue that today’s Republicans are wielding is transgender rights. So far, Gov. Tim Walz has the best response: “Mind your own damn business.” Clinton might have something to say about that, too. He was, after all, impeached by the Gingrich-led House. The Republican-led Senate couldn’t even muster a majority, much less the two-thirds required to convict Clinton for what most Americans viewed as a personal matter. Five Republicans joined all 45 Democrats to acquit Clinton.  Clinton carried Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 1992 and 1996, elevating them to the Blue Wall status they enjoy today. It was an extraordinary feat at the time, since conventional wisdom held that the GOP had a lock on the Electoral College. “We didn’t break the lock; we picked it,” Clinton strategist James Carville said at the time. The imbalance has only grown, with the candidate who wins the popular vote not assured of prevailing in the Electoral College. Clinton and Gore harnessed the energy of their generation just as Harris and Walz (both technically baby boomers — but just barely) must inspire and motivate the generations that follow to win against these built-in structural odds."

I worked in Trump’s White House. Here’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/former-trump-white-house-staffer-olivia-troye-voting-kamala-harris-rcna167352,"I am a lifelong Republican who worked in the Trump White House, and the truth is that I’d rather be backing a candidate from my own party for president. But, for voters who care about preserving our democracy, our freedoms and opportunities, and our country’s standing around the world, there’s only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.  I left the Trump White House in August 2020 because I saw the danger Donald Trump posed for our country. This year, I joined Republicans for Harris, a coalition that gives voice to the millions of Republicans like me and independent voters who continue to reject the extremism and division of Trump. Trump weakened our standing on the world stage, damaged our institutions at home, and restricted our freedoms. He endangers our allies, says he’d allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to “do whatever the hell” he wants to them, and has threatened to withdraw the United States from NATO.  After losing in 2020, Trump tried to overturn a free and fair election, put his own vice president’s life in danger, and unleashed a violent mob on the U.S. Capitol that left five law enforcement officers dead. And still, the Republican Party stood by him. In the three years since, Trump has become even more unhinged, dangerous and extreme. His entire presidential campaign for 2024 is premised on seeking revenge on his political opponents. Just last week, he attacked the Republican governor of Georgia’s wife and family — who support him — since Gov. Brian Kemp was unwilling to lie about the results of the 2020 election.  Trump wants to be a dictator on day one and his MAGA loyalists are all too willing to let it happen. When a political party bends to the will of a single person and puts them on a pedestal, they’re putting party above country at the expense of the integrity of our institutions and the dignity of our democracy. It’s disgraceful. This is not the Republican Party I know and it’s certainly not a Republican Party I can support.  The good news is, we have another option in this election: someone who values democracy, will uphold the rule of law, and who is prepared to stand with our allies and provide steady leadership to the world.  Vice President Kamala Harris is building a broad coalition that includes everyone because, unlike her opponent, she knows that a president’s job is to serve all Americans, not only those who vote for her.  She will protect our freedoms — including women’s right to make their own health care decisions, while Trump wants to ban access to vital reproductive health care. She will stand by our global partners, from Israel to Ukraine to our NATO allies. She will defend our democracy and ensure we remain a nation in which nobody is above the law. She will work with anyone who’s willing to come to the table, on either side of the aisle, to deliver real results for the American people. It’s why I endorsed Harris, and it’s why I’m a proud member of Republicans for Harris.  To my fellow conservatives: The Republican Party has abandoned you. It’s not too late to reject Trump’s chaos and stand with Kamala Harris, who will defend our democracy and fight for our freedoms.  Harris has a vision for the future of our nation. Trump only wants to drag us back into the past. We have an opportunity to be part of that future, to reshape the Republican Party and to restore America’s leadership. We have a chance to join Republicans for Harris and play a part in protecting America from Trump’s MAGA party. This is the way to reset politics toward principles and end Trump’s dead-end populist movement. Our conservative values guide us to make this choice because our country and democracy depend on it."

If you’re a conservative from the South, I’m sure there’s one word this election cycle that’s stuck out to you: freedom. It’s a word that’s traditionally been used by Republicans, but this time around it’s become central to the Democratic Party’s message. When I see the word “freedom” plastered on signs at the Democratic National Convention, I see the Democratic Party stepping forward — and stepping right through a door that Donald Trump and the United States Supreme Court opened for them with the Dobbs decision. Democrats are telling the American people: No, we’re not going to let the federal government control your body. We’re not going to force women to carry their rapist's babies to term. We’re not going to have state-forced birth for a 10-year-old girl. We’re not going to turn our eyes away from women who are bleeding out outside of emergency rooms. Democrats have taken the idea of freedom away from the Republican Party and the American people are taking notice.  One of the more compelling things I’ve heard from a voter this election cycle came from a self-identified libertarian who said they were concerned about Republicans pushing to take control of people’s bodies and people’s health care.  They asked: If they’re doing it to women this year, what are they going to do to the rest of us next year?"

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Ada Brown set aside the rule nationwide, which had been scheduled to take effect Sept. 4, siding with business interests including the Chamber of Commerce. Brown concluded that the Federal Trade Commission lacked authority to issue the rule and deemed it “arbitrary and capricious because it is unreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation.”  Announcing the rule in April, FTC Chair Lina Khan said that noncompete clauses “keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism” and that the rule “will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.” An FTC spokesperson said after the ruling that the agency was seriously considering appealing and noted that the judge’s decision doesn’t prevent the agency “from addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions.” The government’s prospects on appeal aren’t great, however, given this Supreme Court has been broadly skeptical of agency authority and has struck down Biden administration initiatives. The intermediate federal appeals court covering Texas is the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings have sometimes gone too far right even for the Supreme Court.

Barack Obama’s speech for Kamala Harris shows just how much things have changed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 12:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/obamas-dnc-speech-reminds-us-kamala-harris-share-dont-rcna167612,"During the bitterly divided 2004 presidential election, a Senate candidate from Illinois took the stage and urged Americans to think about their common values instead of their differences. Four years later, then-state Sen. Barack Obama spoke at the convention as the party’s presidential nominee. As a candidate who looked like no past party nominee — referring to himself as a “skinny kid with a funny name” — Obama promised hope and change. These promises had a dual nature: to alter the way of doing politics in Washington and return to common values, while also ushering in a new, bold era for a Democratic Party that had long been in the shadow of Reagan-style Republican ideals. The rhetoric inspired voters, but achieving real change proved to be a much more significant challenge. In his Tuesday address at the Democratic National Convention, the change candidate spoke as a party elder, in a speech that recalled themes from his 2004 address. The former president and former first lady Michelle Obama remain popular, especially among Democrats. And the connection to Vice President Kamala Harris is long-standing, as Obama was a supporter of her candidacies for attorney general and U.S. Senate in California. A lot has changed since he was president; but the old Obama was still there, talking about national reconciliation and asserting that, “none of us wants to live in a country that’s bitter and divided,” and urging patience with others who don’t share all of our views. In a 2009 interview, Gwen Ifill referred to Harris as the “female Barack Obama,” describing a new group of Black politicians who chose public service over a more lucrative private sector career. And, of course, Harris served as the vice president to the politician who was once Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden. At the same time, there are some key differences. Harris isn’t the first Black presidential candidate, but she’s the first after the racial backlash of the 2016 election and the Trump presidency, the 2020 George Floyd protests, and the pushback against teaching the nation’s racial history in some states. Harris is also the child of immigrants at a time when immigration is much more polarized and higher on the public agenda than it was when Obama ran in 2008. She’s not the first woman nominee, but she’s the first to run in a post-Dobbs environment. Before becoming Biden’s vice president, she built her national profile on being adversarial toward Trump and his administration. There will be talk of unity and healing at the DNC, but there’s no denying the political climate has become more intense, and the political significance of identity issues has changed.  Obama’s legacy in the party is complicated. He obviously wanted his presidency to end with the election of his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton. Instead, Donald Trump was elected, along with a Republican-controlled Congress. Scholars of political parties, myself included, have criticized Obama’s party-building efforts and connected them to these political setbacks. His chosen leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schulz, had a tumultuous tenure. Obama didn’t do much to build up parties or progressive networks at the state level, in addition to the losses in Congress at the state level. (Although it wasn’t entirely negative; Obama accomplished some long-standing party goals, including but not limited to the Affordable Care Act and major strides in LGBTQ rights and marriage equality.) The constraints on Obama’s ability to deliver the change he promised weren’t all about the Democratic coalition, either. His was a new era of partisan rancor, driven in large part by a unified and hostile Republican opposition. Congressional Republicans refused to work with the administration, talked about making him a one-term president, and refused to even consider his 2016 Supreme Court nominee. When the GOP won control of the House in the 2010 midterms — a historic midterm-seat loss for the president’s party — the prospect of meaningful legislation largely evaporated.  In 2016, the fissure between the Bernie Sanders and Clinton factions was just taking shape, and led to some uncomfortable moments at the national convention. During the Trump years, the party has changed in a few crucial ways. For one, in the 2018 elections and beyond, record numbers of women, people of color, religious minorities and LGBTQ people have won elected office, reflecting Obama’s legacy of historic political firsts. The progressive wing of the party has asserted itself in national politics and policy with the emergence of the “squad” in the House, and significant attention to the presidential bids of Elizabeth Warren and Sanders.  If Harris wins, it’s far from assured she’ll have Democratic majorities in either house of Congress. But if she does, those majorities will look quite different from how they did in 2009.  Following Michelle Obama’s fiery speech, Barack Obama praised the patriotism and leadership of Biden in his own address. He illustrated Harris’ vision of a bolder Democratic Party, both by talking about policy (housing, labor rights) and also delivering a scathing takedown of Trump and Trumpism. He offered a telling detail about how the Democratic Party has shifted, at one point noting that Harris, as California AG, pushed him on legal action against predatory mortgage lenders. While Obama wove these together by suggesting that his — and the Democrats’ — philosophy is one of “mutual responsibility,” the tension between boldness and reconciliation may be even higher now than it was in 2009 or even 2016. Presidents always balance competing imperatives to lead country and party. And after the presidencies of both Trump and Biden, Harris navigates an environment in which both have changed. In 2008, Obama highlighted his policy differences with his opponent, John McCain, and suggested that Republican ideas had failed, capitalizing on the sour public mood at the end of the George W. Bush presidency. Harris will undoubtedly stress policy differences as well, focusing on Trump’s connections with Project 2025. But it’s hard to imagine Obama calling McCain “weird” as a central line of attack. Obama ran after eight years of a Republican-controlled White House, affording him room to attack and promise reinvention. Harris runs as the sitting vice president, facing a delicate balance between affirming the administration she’s served in while forging her own political identity. But in the changed political environment since 2016, she may prove to be more of a change candidate in the end."
Longtime Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell dies at age 87,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 12:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/longtime-democratic-rep-bill-pascrell-dies-age-87-rcna167611,"It was just last week when longtime Rep. Bill Pascrell checked himself into a hospital because of a high fever, which his staff said may have been caused by a respiratory illness. When he was discharged a day later, there were still some hopes that the 87-year-old New Jersey Democrat would be able run for a 15th term on Capitol Hill. It was not to be. The congressman was readmitted to the hospital Sunday night, and as NBC News reported, he passed away three days later. “As our United States Representative, Bill fought to his last breath to return to the job he cherished and to the people he loved,” the statement said. “Bill lived his entire life in Paterson and had an unwavering love for the city he grew up in and served. He is now at peace after a lifetime devoted to our great nation America.” Pascrell is the fourth member of the 118th Congress who has died, following the passing of Democratic Reps. Donald McEachin of Virginia, Donald Payne, Jr. of New Jersey, and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas. As for the future of his House seat, NBC News’ report added, “Because the vacancy has occurred before an Aug. 27 deadline — 70 days before the general election — Democratic county committee members will be able to handpick a new nominee by Aug. 29, according to state election law.” Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, as well as New Jersey Assembly members Shavonda Sumter and Benjie Wimberly, are apparently among the top contenders. The congressman represented one of New Jersey’s Democratic strongholds, and the party is optimistic about keeping the seat in the fall. But most important today is the work Pascrell did on behalf of his constituents for the past several decades. After serving in the U.S. Army and working as a local educator, he served as the director of public works in Paterson, before later leading the city’s Board of Education. In 1987, he was elected to the state Assembly, and in 1990, he was sworn in as Paterson’s mayor. Six years later, Pascrell made it to Congress, where he earned a reputation as a progressive champion and a policy wonk, especially on matters related to tax policy and infrastructure. In 2019, the New Jersey Democrat even became an honorary member of the liberal faction known as “the Squad.” The congressman also seemed to take special pride in being a thorn in Donald Trump’s side, helping lead the fight to obtain the former president’s hidden tax returns. “In the Congress, Congressman Pascrell has been a relentless champion of America’s working families — fighting for workers’ rights and investments in the education of our children,” House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, wrote via social media. “He was a proud co-chair of the Congressional Italian-American Delegation and took great pride in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey being the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution — and he never let us forget any of it!”"
"Trump campaign co-opts Beyoncé’s ‘Freedom,’ the Harris campaign’s anthem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 11:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-campaign-beyonce-freedom-kamala-harris-rcna167576,"Since launching her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris has used Beyoncé’s “Freedom” as a soundtrack to her candidacy — with the artist’s permission. On Tuesday, a Donald Trump campaign spokesperson appeared to co-opt the song, using it in a video of the former president deplaning in Michigan for a campaign event. “Touchdown in Michigan!!” Steven Cheung wrote in the post on X. He also tagged Trump, who recently returned to the platform. The Trump campaign has used songs without artists’ permission over the years. Several musicians or their estates have asked Trump to stop using their songs at his rallies, and some have threatened legal action. The GOP campaign spokesperson’s use of a song that Harris had established as her anthem of sorts is somewhat ironic. Trump recently accused the Democratic nominee of stealing his proposal to end taxes on tips, a policy she floated earlier this month and one he initially put forward in June. (Though neither candidate has released their full plan, many economists have criticized the idea, saying it would result in workers pressuring customers to tip more and encourage Americans to declare more of their income as tips.) Cheung’s video may prompt legal action from Beyoncé, who is known to be protective over the rights to her music. The singer has not commented publicly on the video. When reached for comment by The Hill, Cheung responded: “Freedom, freedom!”"
What anxious parents of neurodivergent children can learn from Tim and Gwen Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 11:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-children-gus-neurodivergent-rcna166748,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s open acknowledgement that he and his wife used fertility treatments to conceive their two children and his candid discussions about that generated one of the most moving moments during a rally in Glendale, Arizona, when people chanted the name of his firstborn daughter, Hope. The positive reaction to the candidate’s discussion of the topic confirms the thumbs-up that Vice President Kamala Harris got for choosing her running mate from every faction of the Democratic Party — from moderates such as Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va.; progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; and even erstwhile conservative Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., who left the party this year. But Tim and Gwen Walz also deserve positive attention for the way they’ve discussed their son, Gus, who came into the national spotlight thanks to a piece in People magazine, about his nonverbal learning disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. That makes him double-neurodiverse. Simply having a neurodivergent son is not enough reason for him to be praised; indeed, many parents of neurodivergent children have been harmful to their children and peddled harmful ideas, including the idea that vaccines cause autism. Rather, what makes the Walz family’s story so reassuring is that they seem to want to help Gus live a good life rather than change who he is. Follow MSNBC's live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. According to the Child Mind Institute, nonverbal learning disorder, or NVLD, affects nonverbal forms of learning like the ability to notice patterns or learn concepts, including visual and social patterns as well as concepts in language and math. Because of the similar traits, people with NVLD are often confused as being on the autism spectrum and vice versa. Most recently, comedian Chris Rock disclosed that he received a diagnosis after a friend initially thought he might be somewhere on the autism spectrum. But while in the past, much of the focus of society and parents has been on how to ""fix"" people who are neurodivergent, the Walzes, who said they noticed that “it became increasingly clear that he was different from his classmates” and saw that he preferred video games and time to himself, made sure in the People article not to highlight Gus’ deficits. Rather than wring their hands, his parents emphasized that he “is brilliant, hyper-aware of details that many of us pass by, and above all else, he’s an excellent son and brother to his sibling.”  It’s encouraging that the Walzes appear unconcerned with forcing  Gus to be more sociable. That must be a hard temptation to resist for a political family that spends time on the campaign trail. Their focus on what Gus does well is a welcome change from the old days. To cite one infamous example, when a teenage Paris Hilton was diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder, she said she was sent to a residential treatment facility because her parents believed she could be “fixed” with “tough love.” Even today, some children with ADHD have food withheld from them as punishment.  The Walzes’ words and their embrace of their son may seem utterly unremarkable. But that’s the point. Loving your children, celebrating their gifts and embracing them fully ought to be unremarkable whether they’re neurodivergent or neurotypical. Neurodivergent people deserve parents who are dedicated to helping them thrive. They deserve family members who know that the way they love, interact and see the world, while different from their neurotypical counterparts, deserves the same respect.  Walz appears to be doing his part on improving the lives of people with disabilities as governor. As my friend David Perry wrote, he’s worked on phasing out parental fees for children on Medicaid, which would reduce the financial burden for parents of children with disabilities. Similarly, the Walz family is fortunate to live in Minnesota, which has programs like Partners in Policymaking (established in 1987) to help people with disabilities and to help their loved ones become better advocates. An AARP survey ranked Minnesota as the No. 1 state overall for long-term services and supports. As for Harris herself, she was the first presidential candidate to release a disability policy in the 2020 Democratic primary. I still wouldn’t say the Walzes have been perfect in how they discuss their son’s disability. For example, when speaking about his disability, they’ve said that his “condition is not a setback — it’s his secret power.” This statement disregards the real accommodations that Gus will need if he is to go to college or enter the workforce. Similarly, many neurodivergent people chafe at the idea of having a “superpower” because of the implication that their worth is tied to their being superior than their counterparts at some tasks. At the same time, it is still a step forward that the Walz family doesn’t see Gus as deficient and has instead focused on what is possible for him, such as obtaining his driver’s license. Importantly, with the national profile they now have, the Walz family can serve as a model to show parents of children with developmental disabilities the joys that come with embracing, and not mending, their children."
Democrats' crunk-infused roll call featured all your favorite hits,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 10:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/dnc-roll-call-songs-playlist-rcna167529,"Democrats set a new standard with their symbolic roll call votes nominating Kamala Harris for president on Tuesday night. Convention roll calls, in which state delegates huddle together to announce their state party's votes for the presidential nominee, are typically somewhat energizing. (Delegates officially nominated Harris during a virtual roll call earlier this month. Tuesday night’s roll call was ceremonial.) It’s common to see people dressed in state-specific garb, or even to see some celebrities sprinkled among the delegates, showing pride in their home states. But Tuesday’s roll call was an uncommonly lit affair.  Indeed, the celebrities showed out. I spotted director Spike Lee among the New York delegates, ""Desperate Housewives"" actor Eva Longoria stood with delegates from Texas, ""The Wire"" actor Wendell Pierce among the Louisianans, and actor Sean Astin — who starred in the iconic sports film ""Rudy"" — among the delegates from Indiana, just to name a few. But it was the music that set things apart. Led by DJ Cassidy — of “Pass the Mic” fame — this year’s roll call featured state officials awarding their delegates to a playlist of musical salutes for each state.  For example, iconic producer and hip-hop hype man Lil Jon, The King of Crunk, is from Georgia — and after walking out to “Welcome to Atlanta,” he performed a rendition of his songs “Turn Down for What”  and “Get Low” when it was Georgia’s turn to award their delegates to Harris. This resulted in some pretty epic scenes of Lil Jon hyping up a crowd of Georgians that featured Sen. Raphael Warnock and Rep. Nikema Williams.  And although Georgia was the only one with a live performance, virtually every state got their turn. Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” played during that state’s turn to award delegates. Beyonce’s “Texas Hold ’Em” played when the Lone Star State’s delegates announced their support for Harris. New Jersey’s delegates swayed to iconic New Jerseyan Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.” as they awarded their votes. Prince's ""1999"" played when Minnesota announced its delegates. And when Kamala Harris’ home state of California awarded its votes, the soundtrack was a medley of songs by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar. Check out a list of all the songs played below, and reflect on what I think was unquestionably the most turnt-up party convention in United States' history. Alabama “Sweet Home Alabama” — Lynyrd Skynyrd Alaska “Feel It Still” — Portugal. The Man Arizona “Edge of Seventeen” — Stevie Nicks Arkansas “Don’t Stop” — Fleetwood Mac California “Next Episode” — Dr. Dre “California Love” — Tupac “Alright” — Kendrick Lamar “Not Like Us” — Kendrick Lamar Colorado “September” — Earth, Wind & Fire Connecticut “Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I’m Yours)” — Stevie Wonder Democrats Abroad “Love Train” — The O’Jays District of Columbia “Let Me Clear My Throat” — DJ Kool Delaware “Higher Love” — Kygo and Whitney Houston Florida “I Won’t Back Down” — Tom Petty Georgia “Welcome to Atlanta” — Jermaine Dupri “Turn Down for What” — Lil Jon and DJ Snake “Get Low” — Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz Guam “Espresso” — Sabrina Carpenter Hawaii  “24k Magic” — Bruno Mars Idaho “Private Idaho” — The B-52’s Illinois “Sirius” — The Alan Parsons Project Indiana “Don’t Stop 'Til You Get Enough” — Michael Jackson Iowa “Celebration” — Kool & the Gang Kansas  “Carry On Wayward Son” — Kansas Kentucky “First Class” — Jack Harlow Louisiana  “All I Do Is Win” — DJ Khaled Maine “Shut Up and Dance” — Walk the Moon Maryland  “Respect” — Aretha Franklin Massachusetts “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” — Dropkick Murphys Michigan “Lose Yourself” — Eminem Minnesota  “1999” — Prince Mississippi “Twistin’ the Night Away” — Sam Cooke Missouri “Good Luck, Babe!” — Chappell Roan Montana  “American Woman” — Lenny Kravitz Nebraska “Firework” — Katy Perry Nevada  “Mr. Brightside” — The Killers New Hampshire “Don’t Stop Believin’” — Journey New Jersey  “Born in the U.S.A.” — Bruce Springsteen New Mexico “Confident” — Demi Lovato New York “Empire State of Mind” — Jay-Z and Alicia Keys North Carolina “Raise Up” — Petey Pablo North Dakota “Girl on Fire” — Alicia Keys Northern Mariana Islands “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” — Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell Ohio “Green Light” — John Legend Oklahoma “Ain’t Going Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up)” — Garth Brooks Oregon “Float On” — Modest Mouse Pennsylvania “Motownphilly” — Boyz II Men “Black and Yellow” — Wiz Khalifa Puerto Rico “Despacito” — Luis Fonsi Rhode Island “Shake It Off” — Taylor Swift South Carolina “Get Up” — James Brown South Dakota “What I Like About You” — The Romantics Tennessee “9 to 5” — Dolly Parton Texas “Texas Hold 'Em” — Beyoncé Utah “Animal” — Neon Trees Vermont “Stick Season” — Noah Kahan U.S. Virgin Islands “VI to the Bone” — Mic Love Virginia “The Way I Are” — Timbaland Washington “Can’t Hold Us” — Macklemore and Ryan Lewis West Virginia “Take Me Home, Country Roads” — John Denver Wisconsin “Jump Around” — House of Pain Wyoming “I Gotta Feeling” — The Black Eyed Peas"
