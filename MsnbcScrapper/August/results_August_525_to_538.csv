The incumbent congressman’s allies appear concerned about his electoral fate. * Donald Trump really wanted an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union. He didn’t get it: The UAW has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. * It was close, but in Arizona’s most closely watched congressional primary, NBC News projects that Republican Abe Hamadeh has defeated Blake Masters. * The main super PAC supporting Harris’ 2024 candidacy began running a new ad on Wednesday with an interesting tagline: “Let the future begin.” * Traditionally, potential running mates have been cautious not to appear too eager, but given the unprecedented circumstances about the Democratic campaign this year, several leading contenders for Harris’ ticket — Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky — have released campaign-style videos in recent days introducing themselves to voters and praising Harris. * An Economist/YouGov poll conducted roughly two weeks ago found Trump leading President Joe Biden by 2 points. The new Economist/YouGov poll, however, found Harris leading Trump, 46% to 44%. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * At a campaign event in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night, Trump suggested that Republican Senate hopeful David McCormick is running for governor. Later, during the same remarks, the former president repeated the same mistake. * Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who has earned a reputation as a sycophantic Trump ally, declared Wednesday that “the hard truth” is the Trump campaign’s messaging needs “a massive reset.” * And in Utah, the official results in a close Republican primary found incumbent Rep.

"Ahead of sentencing, Jan. 6 defendant leans on ‘Foxmania’ defense",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 8:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ahead-sentencing-jan-6-defendant-leans-foxmania-defense-rcna164683,"A man named David Brian Howard is poised to appear in court tomorrow, where he’ll likely become the latest Jan. 6 defendant to receive a criminal sentence. As part of his legal defense, however, Howard is blaming Fox News for having an unhealthy influence on his perspective. As The New Republic reported: If this sounds at all familiar, it’s probably because Howard isn’t the first Jan. 6 defendant to reference the controversial cable network as part of a legal defense. NBC News also reported on a different Jan. 6 defendant (who pleaded guilty) whose lawyer said ahead of sentencing that his client was infected with “Foxmania” from watching too much Fox News. “He became hooked with what I call ‘Foxitus’ or ‘Foxmania’ and became interested in the political aspect and started believing what was being fed to him,” the defense attorney said. We don’t yet know the extent to which this argument will matter — Antonio’s sentencing is still a few weeks away — and Howard will also soon learn whether the “Foxmania” defense works in his favor. Either way, Fox News executives probably aren’t pleased to see suspected Jan. 6 criminals blaming their network’s coverage for their misguided actions."
Why Trump’s new commitment to pardons for Jan. 6 rioters matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-commitment-pardons-jan-6-rioters-matters-rcna164670,"Donald Trump has spent much of the campaign season lying uncontrollably about the Jan. 6 attack he instigated, and at the former president’s latest rally in Pennsylvania, the Republican kept the assault on reality going. Trump repeated a familiar lie about Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, he lied again about his Jan. 6 crowd size, and he rewrote history by claiming that some of his followers “walked peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol.” As part of the same remarks, Trump also falsely accused members of the Jan. 6 committee of “deleting and destroying” evidence that would’ve made him appear innocent. But as exasperating as these false claims were, the more important rhetoric came a few hours earlier, during Trump’s disastrous appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists. The New York Times reported: As difficult as this might be to believe, ABC News anchor Rachel Scott reminded the Republican of the extensive injuries to police officers during the insurrectionist violence, including an officer who lost an eye. She asked whether the rioters who clashed with those officers are “patriots” who “deserve pardons.”Trump initially responded by ignoring the question and talking about protesters spray-painting limestone at the Capitol last week. So Scott tried again, asking whether he’s prepared to pardon “rioters who assaulted police officers.” The GOP nominee replied, “Oh, absolutely. If they’re innocent, I’d pardon them.” When Scott noted that they were talking about criminals who’ve already been convicted, Trump added that they were “convicted by a very, very tough system” — as if that somehow left open the possibility that the violent rioters, some of whom pleaded guilty, might still be innocent and deserving of presidential pardons.This was, as a Politico report noted, “the most explicit promise Trump has made about the range of defendants he might spring from prison if he takes office — a group that now appears to include some of the most notoriously violent actors that day.” Quite right. As regular readers might recall, it was in mid-March when the former president declared that pardoning “the January 6 Hostages,” whom he said were being “wrongfully imprisoned,” would be among his “first acts” upon returning to the White House. Less than a week later, Trump offered some additional clarity to his plan: Jan. 6 rioters could expect pardons on “the first day” of his second term. According to those on the former president’s team, Jan. 6 pardons would be considered on a case-by-case basis — the idea being that Trump would exercise at least some caution and wouldn’t simply pardon everyone convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol. But the presumptive GOP nominee himself apparently has a different perspective on this. When Trump sat down with Time magazine’s Eric Cortellessa in the spring, the reporter reminded him that more than 800 Jan. 6 participants have been sentenced through our judicial system and most of them pleaded guilty. Others were convicted by juries. “Will you consider pardoning every one of them?” Cortellessa asked. “I would consider that, yes,” Trump replied. Apparently surprised, the Time reporter added, “Really?” to which the Republican said, “Yes, absolutely.” (He went on to share some related and bizarre ideas about the police “ushering” rioters into the Capitol, and a nefarious “they” who “destroyed” evidence that would’ve made him look better.) As an NBC News report added soon after, Trump was referring to Jan. 6 defendants “caught on tape brandishing or using firearms, stun guns, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bike racks, batons, a metal whip, office furniture, pepper spray, bear spray, a tomahawk ax, a hatchet, a hockey stick, knuckle gloves, a baseball bat, a massive ‘Trump’ billboard, ‘Trump’ flags, a pitchfork, pieces of lumber, crutches and even an explosive device during the brutal attack that injured about 140 police officers.”It was two years ago when the Republican first broached this subject, telling a Tennessee audience that he would look “very, very seriously” at pardoning those who were arrested for Jan. 6 crimes. For emphasis, he added, “very, very seriously.” Twenty-five months later, his position on the rioters, whom he’s labeled “J-6 patriots,” is far more radical — to the point that Trump is now the first major-party presidential candidate in the history of American politics to run on a platform that effectively says, “Vote for me and I’ll deliberately release violent criminals back onto the streets.” As we’ve discussed, it’s also important to acknowledge the broader circumstances. In the weeks, months and years that followed the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, federal prosecutors got to work charging rioters, not just because they committed crimes, and not just to hold them accountable, but also to prevent future attacks. The message was intended to be clear: The United States prosecuted these insurrectionists, so those thinking about following in their footsteps should expect to face legal consequences, too. Trump intends to silence that message, undo what’s been done and make clear that criminals who ignore the law in his name need not worry about accountability. There is arguably no greater example of the Republican’s hostility toward the rule of law. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"As JD Vance flounders, Trump does surprisingly little to help",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 6:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-flounders-donald-trump-surprisingly-little-help-election-2024-rcna164655,"The Wall Street Journal asked Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer this week about Donald Trump choosing Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. “Well, it’s too late to rethink it,” the North Dakotan responded. It’s been that kind of rollout for the GOP’s vice-presidential nominee. “I’ll bet President Trump is sitting there scratching his head and wondering, 'why did I pick this guy?'” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CBS News a few days ago. “The choice may be one of the best things he ever did for Democrats.” Just as importantly, quite a few Republicans have also struggled to pretend that they’re satisfied with the former president’s current running mate. The larger question remains, however, what Trump thinks of his choice. As it turns out, Vance was a topic of conversation during the Republican’s disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists’ conference. USA Today reported: The line of inquiry couldn’t have been more straightforward. “When you look at JD Vance, is he ready on Day One?” Faulkner asked. What Trump should have said was, “Of course he is. I wouldn’t have chosen him for my ticket if I wasn’t certain he could assume the presidency in the event of a crisis.” But instead of saying that, Trump instead argued that his running mate just isn’t that important. “Historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” the former president said. “I mean, virtually no impact. ... Virtually never has it mattered.” Remember, the question was whether his running mate would be ready to lead in January. Instead of answering directly, Trump effectively said that his running mate just isn’t that important. As part of the same appearance, he was also asked about Vance’s contempt for American couples without children, and Trump didn’t exactly have compelling answers on this, either. It’s been difficult to keep up with the recent reporting featuring the words “Vance” and “buyers’ remorse,” which helps explain why the Ohio senator begins his national effort with a negative favorability rating — a rarity for any modern running mate. Trump’s latest comments almost certainly won’t help. Trump “has a choice,” Schumer added this past weekend. “Does he keep Vance on the ticket, where he already has a whole lot of baggage ... or does he pick someone new?” Such talk is almost certainly premature, though I have a hunch the New York Democrat won’t be the last prominent political figure to ask such a question."
"At NABJ event, Trump lights his outreach to Black voters on fire",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nabj-event-trump-lights-outreach-black-voters-fire-rcna164640,"It probably seemed like a good idea at the time. The National Association of Black Journalists extended an invitation to Donald Trump to appear at their convention, creating an opportunity for the organization to raise its visibility, and offering NABJ professionals an opportunity to hear directly from a man who might soon become president. The Republican nominee, meanwhile, accepted the invitation, hoping to reach an audience beyond his far-right base. What could possibly go wrong? Before the former president even took the stage, problems emerged. As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones explained, “The organization faced a deluge of denunciations from journalists and activists after it announced it would give a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the free press, spread racist propaganda and repeatedly insulted Black journalists. In fact, NABJ has issued several statements in recent years denouncing Trump’s illiberal behavior and attacks on its members.” But after the GOP nominee actually started speaking, Trump not only made matters far worse, he also validated the concerns of those who warned the NABJ that it was making a mistake by giving him a platform in the first place. NBC News reported: To be sure, Trump’s appearance at the convention was a train wreck for a variety of reasons. His rhetoric about “Black jobs,” for example, was a mess. He similarly went out of his way to be as insulting and condescending as possible to some of the Black women who asked him good and fair questions. As is usually the case, he also lied — a lot — about matters large and small. But it was Trump’s comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity that were jaw-dropping. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic vice president. “And she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the Republican added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded, “Is she Indian or is she Black?” The unscripted comments were obviously racist. They were also sadly predictable given Trump’s lengthy record of overt racism. What's more, as a New York Times analysis added, “The audacity of Mr. Trump, a white man, questioning how much a Black woman truly belongs to Black America was particularly incendiary. ... [I]t evoked an ugly history in this country, in which white America has often declared the racial categories that define citizens, and sought to determine who gets to call themselves what.” The idea that Harris — who is both Indian American and Black — could have a multifaceted racial and ethnic background is apparently intolerable to the Republican candidate. Trump expects voters to believe that the vice president “happened to turn Black,” which is every bit as wrong and offensive as it seems. Team Trump developed a plan to go after the likely Democratic nominee. Having Trump question Harris’ identity, while insisting that she “obviously” doesn’t “respect” her Indian and Black heritage, was not part of that plan. Indeed, it didn’t come as too big of a surprise when the former president’s aides pulled the plug on the appearance and Trump left the stage before the end of his scheduled appearance — though he continued to go after Harris’ identity in the hours that followed the event. In a normal and healthy political environment, in a normal and healthy political party, this was the sort of appearance that might very well end a candidacy. The larger question isn’t whether Trump is relying on racism — again — to advance his quest for power, because the answer is obvious. Rather, the question is why in the world would he put on this racist display while appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention. Let’s not forget that for much of the year, the Republican and his team seemed determined to improve their showing with Black voters. What’s more, there was some polling evidence that suggested those efforts were paying off, and Trump was poised to fare better in communities of color in 2024 than any other modern GOP nominee. But if that was a priority for Team Trump when it was facing President Joe Biden, it’s no longer a priority now. What the public saw at Wednesday’s event was a candidate who had a plan for reaching out to Black voters, and then set that plan on fire. In fact, it’s easy to believe that those in attendance at the NABJ event were not the intended audience at all. As The Washington Post’s Colbert I. King summarized in his latest column, “As offensive as all that was to the Black men and women staring in his direction, Trump knew it was getting a belly laugh with his crowd, who can’t get enough of that stuff.” Common sense suggests Trump did not earn any support on Wednesday from communities of color, but by all appearances, they weren’t the intended audience for his offensive antics."
Brooke Shields on why she is in the most ‘exciting’ stage of her career yet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/brooke-shields-exciting-stage-career-yet-rcna164095,"Actress and model Brooke Shields has been working since she was 11 months old. But at age 59, she says she is in the most “challenging and exciting” stage of her career yet. “I think what’s exciting about it is it’s so unknown,” she told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. Shields was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list, which was revealed on Thursday. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. Shields recently founded Commence, a New York-based hair care company, for women over the age of 40. And earlier this year, Shields was elected president of the Actors Equity Association, a union representing approximately 51,000 actors and stage managers in the United States. Shields said she came up with the idea for Commence during the pandemic when she was having conversations online with women over the age of 40. “I wanted to hear what women my age were really experiencing, what they were feeling … how they felt they were being represented… And inevitably, all of them started saying how upset they were … that there was this feeling that once you hit a certain age, that all of a sudden, you lose all your value,” said Shields. She noted that the marketing is geared to very young women “and then you’re sort of put into this world where you’re in Depends, dentures… There is a whole bracket in the middle.” Commence is still in its early days. According to Forbes, Shields has raised $3.5 million from outside investors to help fund the company’s first three products, which were released in June. But she is on a mission to make women feel extraordinary. “We have experience. We have years, we’ve gone through so much, many of us have raised children… or started companies… There should be no reason why we are discounted,” she said. McGrath recounted a time when Shields was in her 20s and being interviewed by a man who asked her if it ever worried her that her career had peaked already. “I remember actually feeling bad for the person,” Shields recounted. “Because it seemed like such a ridiculous thing to ask … I remember thinking, ‘Oh, that seems like a waste of a question because I’m just beginning…’” McGrath asked how Shields would answer that question today.  “I’m going to forever peak … Why should there be one peak? Why does everything then have to mean you’re going downhill… And yes, the world is set up to want to champion youth …and that is great. I’m not occupying that stage right now, but I am occupying an equally exciting, perhaps more empowered stage because I have excitement, belief, energy, and experience of all things … I now come at things with such a different level of belief in myself and a fight. I’m not knocked over easily anymore. So, I would say that I will keep peaking.”"
How a career pivot at age 32 led Ava DuVernay to become the first Black woman to direct a $100M film,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/career-pivot-age-32-led-ava-duvernay-become-first-black-woman-direct-1-rcna164496,"There’s no doubt that Ava DuVernay has shaken up the film industry. She was the first Black woman to win the directing award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012, to be nominated for Best Director for a Golden Globe, to have her film (“Selma”) nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and to direct a $100-million-grossing movie (“A Wrinkle in Time""). However, DuVernay didn’t pick up a camera until 2005 when she was 32 years old. Until that point, she had been working in public relations. DuVernay, who was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list, said one takeaway from her journey is that it’s never too late to make a change. “You decide when it’s too late,” the 51-year-old told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. “You decide when you don’t want to try anymore and when you’re gonna lean in a little bit… You are the director of your life… You decide how far you can go, no one else does.” DuVernay recounted being a publicist in her 30s promoting films and television shows. She loved it, but while on set started to think about how she would tell the story. “I was wishing that I was directing. And one day I thought, ‘Well, why don’t I try’?” said DuVernay, who quit her job that day. She noted, however that “one of the things that I tell people when they’re looking to make a change or pursue something new is, let it be, do it slowly… I was a weekend warrior. I was writing scripts on weekends… I was taking time, you know, before work, after work, to read, to take classes, and to slowly make my way towards the dream… The best part is the journey.” She also spoke about one of her latest projects, “Origin,” which is streaming on Hulu. The film is based on the life of writer Isabel Wilkerson (played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), who explores how the caste system can help us better understand what Black people experience in America. DuVernay said it was important for her to produce and release the movie before the 2024 election. “I won’t say that I’m looking at have, you know, an impact in terms of the outcome of the election, I just want people to be a lot more rigorous,” she said. “I want to see more rigor in our conversations around the things that matter.” She continued: “I feel a general fatigue, I feel like people are exhausted. With the onslaught of news, with the onslaught of misinformation with kind of the tribalism, you’re on this side, I’m on this side… I think there’s a laziness, sometimes an apathy, folks really feeling very, very singular and kind of closed off in the way that they want to think… So the goal was for the film is to just kind of awaken get us to see one another in a different way. And hopefully that contributes to different conversations and more healthy outcomes.”  "
Legendary basketball coach Dawn Staley: ‘Ask for what you’re worth’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/legendary-basketball-coach-dawn-staley-ask-re-rcna164478,"Some research suggests that women are more likely to shy away from negotiating their salaries in comparison to men. That doesn’t include Dawn Staley. In 2021, Staley became one of the highest-paid coaches in women’s college basketball when she signed a $22.4 million, seven-year contract. During the negotiation process, the 54-year-old head coach of University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball, said she wasn’t afraid to “strike when the iron is hot.” “I probably looked at my male counterpart at the time and saw that his raises were much more than my raises and his success didn’t match our success,” Staley told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath.  “So I thought it was a great opportunity for me to just speak on that… When you bet on yourself, when you utilize the perseverance that it took to get you to that status, it’s the same kind of gall it takes to go in there ask for what you’re worth… You’re asking for what you deserve. Don’t be afraid to go in and do that.” Staley was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list, which was revealed on Thursday. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. Staley, an Olympic gold medalist and Hall of Fame point guard herself, led the South Carolina Gamecocks to NCAA Championship titles in 2022 and 2024. This year, her team was undefeated and the NCAA women’s championship game between Iowa and South Carolina drew in a record 18.7 million viewers. “What I make of the movement of women’s basketball is this. I do believe we’ve been held back for a very long time. And now … we’re trying to get to the top and get as many eyeballs on our game and people are clamoring. They’re clamoring to watch,” said Staley. ""They’re clamoring to be in attendance. They’re buying … record amounts of apparel and clothing. I just think it’s been on the rise for so long. Now, it's uncontrollable. I think we’re in a great place where people are really looking at us as a sport.” McGrath asked Staley if she viewed being over 50 as an advantage or disadvantage in her line of work. “Being over 50 is the most liberating,” said Staley. “Like seriously, I know myself. Like being 50, you’re more lean in life. You know what you like. You know what you don’t like. And I know a lot of people will look at me and say ‘I can’t believe she’s over 50.’ I don’t always act like I’m over 50. I act age-appropriate when necessary, but when I’m with my players, I feel in my 30s.”"
Mika: Kamala Harris is our 'best hope of saving health care for women in America',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/mika-kamala-harris-best-hope-saving-healthcare-women-america-rcna164562,"As we launch ""Know Your Value"" and Forbes’ fourth annual ""50 Over 50"" U.S. list (which may be our most impressive one yet), I think it’s important to note that our headliner for the very first list four years ago was Vice President Kamala Harris. And today, Harris at 59 years old is seen as the young, fresh face of presidential politics. Isn’t life sweet? When I first launched this list, I thought I would be paving the way for women in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and well beyond to validate their place, role and impact in today’s society. What I discovered is that we are catching up with a well-established successful global movement. Women over 50 are thriving, impactful, paving a long runway for the next generation. And now our young “50 Over 50” listee is leading the way for women at a time in U.S. politics when our health is at stake — literally. Vice President Kamala Harris is an internet sensation and has turned the race around breaking fundraising records in just one week. For women, her breakout campaign is just in time.  There is already so much suffering at the hands of Trump Republicans. There are women across the country who need abortion health care to either survive, be able to have babies again, or to save themselves and their families from trauma who are left with no options. Take Samantha Casiano, of East Texas, who found out at her 20-week ultrasound that her baby had a rare and fatal condition that prevented the skull and brain from fully forming. She was told her baby was going to die — but abortion laws in the state forced her to give birth anyway. Four hours after giving birth, Casiano’s daughter, Halo Hope, died in her arms. Or what about Deborah Dobert in Florida, who was forced to carry her son, Milo, to term — even though he had no kidneys and would die soon after birth. Not only did Milo die, doctors told Dobert that her pregnancy put her at high risk of preeclampsia, which can be fatal. And what about Christina Zielke, who was in Ohio when she started to miscarry. Because of the state’s six-week abortion ban, the ER wouldn’t treat her miscarriage even though she was bleeding profusely. Can you imagine “passing blood clots the size of golf balls” and being told by the hospital that it needed proof there was no fetal development and to come back in two days? It is as if we are living in the dark ages. So Kamala Harris is our first best hope of saving health care for women in America. It took just one generation for Harris (the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants) to reach the highest levels of government and to make history in America as the first Black, Asian and female candidate to lead a major party’s ticket. And that, my friends, is what America is all about. The excitement we are seeing and feeling about Harris is because she channels all of our dreams about this country — that literally anything is possible. And it comes at a time when the Republican nominee and his misogynistic running mate are campaigning on what is not possible.  They’re against abortion health care. They’re against a deal on immigration unless it serves them politically. They’re against saving Ukraine — and therefore peace in the world. They are against commonsense, gun safety measures. The list goes on and on. The emergence of Harris on the presidential campaign stage feels like the sun coming out after a long, dark storm. And it is so wonderful to be releasing a list that celebrates women at their most powerful stage in life, where their wisdom and life experience come together as they firmly reject the notion that their best years are behind them. And I simply think it’s absolutely amazing that Harris is the fresh, young face poised to fight for our freedoms and our future."
"Mika: With $15 trillion in spending power and decades of wisdom, women over 50 are THE incredible untapped resource",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/business-culture/mika-15-trillion-spending-power-decades-wisdom-women-50-are-incredible-rcna164072,"In 2021, when Know Your Value partnered with Forbes to publish our first ever ""50 Over 50"" list, Vice President Kamala Harris, television producer and screenwriter Shonda Rhimes, founder Julie Wainwright and investor Cathie Wood headlined the inaugural edition.    To our delight, we discovered that some wannabe listers’ applications were rejected … because they were too young! Imagine that.   Today, Harris is a candidate for president (and is seen as the “younger” contender!) and Forbes and Know Your Value’s ""50 Over 50"" list has since become a global success and a cross-cultural, multigenerational movement.  We know the importance of spotlighting women around the world who are reshaping the image of life and work for women in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond. The lists shatter stereotypes and paves the long runway for the next generation of women leaders, firmly rejecting the notion that our best years are behind us.  Today as we release our fourth annual ""50 Over 50"" U.S. list, we are celebrating groundbreakers in biotech, education, retail, architecture and beyond. And even singers and activists who are releasing new albums in their mid-80s (we’re looking at you, Mavis Staples!) We have arrived — and then some. This year’s list may be our most impressive yet.  It includes actress Brooke Shields, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and basketball coach Dawn Staley — just to name a few. Our oldest honoree, activist and philanthropist Deborah Szekely, is proving it’s never too late to make an impact, even at the age of 102. Another favorite: Hollywood starlet June Squibb, whose acting career took off after the age of 80! At 94, Squibb still performs her own stunts — as we saw in her new film “Thelma”— when she hilariously runs off with an adult scooter at a senior home. She is a shining example of how age does not mean limitation or irrelevance. Also on the list: 67-year-old Valerie Jarrett, who served as senior advisor to President Obama from 2009 to 2017, making her the longest serving senior advisor to a president in history. Jarrett, who is now the CEO of the Obama Foundation, was nominated for our list by her daughter, Laura Jarrett, co-anchor of the Saturday TODAY show.  Women over 50 have made so much headway this year — whether it be in politics, the sciences, arts and entertainment. Female CEOs are now out earning their male counterparts. Women over the age of 50 account for 27 percent of all consumer spending. Forbes calls us “super consumers” because — with more than $15 trillion in purchasing power — we are the wealthiest and most active generation in history. Just look at this year’s Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition, which featured 69-year-old journalist Gayle King. She follows Martha Stewart, who last year at 81 became the oldest woman to appear on the magazine’s iconic cover. Stewart was also featured in this year’s issue, alongside Christie Brinkley, 70; Molly Sims, 51; Roshumba Williams, 55; and Paulina Porizkova, 59 (someone who was also a guest speaker at our inaugural 30/50 Summit!).  Businesses are starting to think more about the consumer segment that is women over the age of 50. QVC recently launched their standout campaign, “The Age of Possibility,” aimed at women over 50. Brooke Shield’s new business, Commence, is specifically building products for women in their 40s, 50s and beyond. Forbes Over 50 alumna Bobbi Brown frequently features women in their 50s and 60s in the advertising for Jones Road Beauty. Women over 50 are not mere observers of life’s rich pageant; we are leading the way. I created the ""50 Over 50"" list in part for women who are in their 20s and 30s, to prove to them they will have more opportunity and more time than they ever imagined. To show them that it’s OK to take your time, to make mistakes, to be comfortable pressing reset, pivot careers, and yes, start over. What I did not expect was this movement’s staggering success. I thought I was creating a place for women to slowly step into.  Instead, we are racing to keep up with the surging numbers of incredibly successful women in this age group. This is  a life-changing message for younger women. They can take that ticking clock that always made them feel like they were falling behind, and smash it into a million pieces. I am profoundly grateful for the women of the ""50 Over 50,"" and the work they are each accomplishing. This year’s list is just more proof that the sky’s the limit for us… And perhaps next year we will see one of our honorees as president of the United States? For now, let’s get ready to meet in New York and then dance together in the desert in Abu Dhabi. See you there!  "
Forbes and Know Your Value reveal 4th annual ‘50 Over 50’ U.S. list,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/forbes-know-value-reveal-4th-annual-50-50-us-list-rcna164075,"Your career runway is long. And the women on this year’s “50 Over 50” U.S. list prove it. On Thursday, Forbes and Know Your Value released its fourth annual list, which spotlights women who have rejected the conventional wisdom that their best years are behind them. The women on this year’s list come from dozens of industries, including biotech, education, retail, architecture and beyond. The honorees achieved their greatest accomplishments and are making their biggest impact after the age of 50. “From filmmaker Ava DuVernay at 51, to former presidential advisor Valerie Jarrett at 67, to Michele Kang, a 65-year-old businesswoman and sports team owner, to actress June Squibb at 94 years young, this year’s list may be our most impressive yet,” said Know Your Value founder and “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski. Whittling down the honorees was a months-long process. Forbes and Know Your Value vetted thousands of nominees. Semifinalists were then reviewed by expert judges – a panel of alumnae that included entrepreneurs Suze Orman and Laura Geller, venture capitalist Theresia Gouw, and AnitaB.org president Brenda Darden Wilkerson – followed by more debate and research. The list is broken up into four categories: Impact, Investment, Innovation and Lifestyle, with 50 women on each list. Entrepreneurship was a major theme this year, noted Maggie McGrath, editor of ForbesWomen. “We have 75 or so women who have either founded or own their company who are on this year’s list. And a lot of them got them the entrepreneurial bug over the age of 50.” That includes 57-year-old Diana Levy, a stay-at-home mom for over 20 years, who founded Undercover Snacks after two of her daughters were diagnosed with Celiac disease. It’s now sold in 25,000 stores across the U.S. and on United Airlines flights. A number of women in politics and policy also made the list. That includes Jarrett, who at 52 years old became advisor to then-President Obama in 2009. She became the longest senior advisor to a president in history. And in October 2020, at the age of 63, Jarrett accepted a new job from Obama as director of the Obama Foundation. The following year, she became CEO. Jarrett first stepped into the White House as an advisor to President Obama in January 2009, she was 52 years old. Known as “the other side of Barack Obama’s brain,” she was the longest-serving senior advisor to a president in history. While in the West Wing, Jarrett oversaw the Offices of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs and chaired the White House Council on Women and Girls. In October 2020, at age 63, Jarrett accepted a new job from Obama as director of the Chicago-based Obama Foundation; the following year, she became CEO.  Also on the list is 70-year-old Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Sen. John McCain. In 2023, she was appointed executive director of the United Nations’ World Food Programme, which provides food to vulnerable populations, including those displaced by war, famine and natural disaster. “She is just an extraordinary humanitarian leader and activist,” said Huma Abedin, an MSNBC contributor and vice-chair of Forbes and Know Your Value’s 30/50 summit. Other notable listmakers included: ·      Dawn Staley, 54, Head Coach, University of South Carolina Women’s Basketball ·      Miriam Rivera, 60, Cofounder, CEO, Ulu Ventures ·      Peggy Johnson, 62, CEO, Agility Robotics ·      Brooke Shields, 59, Actress, Founder, CEO, Commence ·      Cecile Richards, 67,  Cofounder, Charley  ·      Julia Louis-Dreyfus, 63, Actor; Host, Wiser Than Me Podcast   ·      Anna Wintour, 74, Global Chief Content Officer, Conde Nast; Editor-in-Chief, Vogue ·      Danielle Steel, 76, Author ·      Patti Smith, 77,  Author, Artist ·      Val Ackerman, 64,  Commissioner, Big East Conference  ·      Akiko Iwasaki, 53, Professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute ·      Marlena Fejzo, 56, scientist, University of Southern California; Chief Scientific Officer, Harmonia Health ·      LaTosha Brown, 53, Cofounder, Black Voters Matter Brzezinski said one of the biggest lessons young women can learn from this year’s honorees is that they have time to figure out what they want to do in life. “Living longer, living better and having success later in life, it’s the long runway,” said Brzezinski. So younger women can calm down, take a couple of detours in life, do some different things. It is OK. there’s not rush anymore.”  Check out the full list here."
Trump gave another reason why he’s too old to run for president,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-too-old-president-age-harris-nabj-rcna164613,"In a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken after the presidential debate in June, 86% of Americans said President Joe Biden was too old to serve a second term. This survey and similar findings played an essential role in Biden’s decision to depart the presidential race, directly rebutting the president’s contention that only donors and media elites wanted him not to run. Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum since entering the race, while running on a platform almost identical to Biden’s, has only confirmed the depth of voters’ concerns about the president’s age. And yet since Biden dropped out, it has been largely forgotten that many voters are also rightly concerned about Donald Trump’s age. In the same Post/ABC poll, 60% of Americans, including 65% of independents, said Trump is too old for another term. But apart from a few initial articles and some jabs on social media, the question of Trump’s age has largely been forgotten. To be sure, Harris’ campaign is busy introducing her to voters. And in the wake of Trump’s naming JD Vance as his running mate, Democrats have delighted in pointing out that the MAGA movement’s leaders are somewhere between weird and straight-up creepy. But there’s still nearly 100 days left until Election Day — plenty of time to return to the issue. Even if some media outlets seem curiously incurious about age since Biden stepped aside, Trump’s age remains a serious issue. Should the 78-year-old Trump win in November, he would be older upon taking office than Biden was when he took office in 2021. Trump has a history of heart disease yet habitually releases medical records lacking any useful details. His personal physician when he first ran for president later admitted Trump outright dictated the memo declaring that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” In 2020, he and his team hid the seriousness of his Covid infection from the public. His assurances of his cognitive and physical health amount to “trust me.” Four years in the White House did not age Trump as much as other presidents — perhaps because he spent less scheduled time working than any other president. But time comes for everyone, and Trump is no exception. Even a cursory contrast between Trump’s first and third runs for the presidency shows him clearly diminished from his initial campaign. His tendency to ramble has only grown, and the confident bluster of 2016 has given way to exhaustion. He loses track of his thoughts mid-sentence or even mid-word. He asks his supporters to vote 24 hours after asking them not to vote. He mixes up names with increasing frequency, confusing Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley and Biden with Barack Obama. He even struggled to keep his eyes open at his Manhattan criminal trial this year. And Trump’s own staff knows his struggles. Just as Biden’s staff increasingly limited the president’s media and public appearances until June’s debate left it with no choice, so has Trump’s staff largely kept him confined to friendly venues. In his first two runs for the presidency, Trump frequently sat down with a wide range of media. This time around, he has stuck largely to Fox News and other such outlets. Trump’s disastrous appearance Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention showed exactly why his staff has built that bubble. Afterwards, at a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., Trump tried a new way to parse the issue. “81 is not old,” he insisted. “But [Biden] is a bad 81.” (In the same rally, he referred to Senate candidate Dave McCormick as Pennsylvania’s “future governor.”) The former president’s new excuse is further confirmation that voters’ concerns about Trump’s age should not be forgotten. Yes, if Democrats bring it up, they will be accused of being hypocrites after having long rejected calls for Biden to step aside. But in the end, they acceded to voters’ wishes — and reality. The concern about Trump’s age is no less legitimate. The presidency is an incredibly difficult job, requiring long hours, quick decisions and extraordinary focus. Those requirements have not changed since Biden dropped out."
JD Vance’s policies for parents are even more sinister beneath the surface,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vances-childless-cat-lady-comment-isnt-even-worst-rcna164288,"If Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, were merely a “pro-family” politician, no one would bat an eye. Helping parents with the difficult and important work of raising children is a bipartisan goal, even if Democrats and Republicans may disagree on how best to do it. But as usual, Donald Trump’s running mate couldn’t help himself. By now most people have heard about Vance’s attack on “childless cat ladies.” It wasn’t a stray remark; Vance has repeatedly expressed his disdain for those “childless sociopaths,” whom he argues “don’t have a direct stake” in our country. But it isn’t just rhetoric: Vance has proposed sweeping policy changes to the political and economic status of parents and nonparents. Taken together, they reveal a particularly selfish perspective on politics, as though we all view policy choices only through our narrow self-interest. Begin with taxes. “If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year,” Vance said in a 2021 interview, “and you’ve got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don’t have any kids. It’s that simple.” The first problem here is that households with children already pay lower taxes than people without them. For instance, look at the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income workers. In 2023, a married couple with no children could only get a credit if their income was lower than $24,210. A couple with two children was eligible if their income was up to $59,478. The credit itself was worth only $600 to childless couples, but up to $6,600 for those with three children — a full 11 times as much. That’s just one tax credit; parents also get personal exemptions for children, the child tax credit, deductions for child care and many more. If Vance wants to enhance those features of the tax code, he’ll get lots of agreement from Democrats, who are also eager to expand the affordability of child care, give kids free lunch in schools and pass many other pro-family policies. This week, in fact, Senate Democrats are moving ahead with a House bill — backed by nearly 170 Republicans — that would expand the child tax credit. But rather than prove his pro-family bona fides, Vance is expected to skip the vote. The trouble is that Vance presents more tax breaks for parents not as a way to help people who need it, but a moral judgment in favor of the very act of becoming a parent — and a punishment for those who can’t have children, haven’t had them yet, or have decided not to. We should “reward the things that we think are good,” he said in that 2021 interview, and “punish the things that we think are bad.” His views on taxes are just one indication of Vance’s perspective. “When you go to the polls in this country, you should have more power — more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic — than people who don’t have kids,” he said in a 2021 speech. “If you don’t have much of an investment in the future of this country, then maybe you shouldn’t get nearly the same voice.” This idea is not just an affront to one-person-one-vote democracy, it’s a remarkably selfish conception of what democracy actually entails. When we vote on which direction our nation should go, we aren’t just trying to maximize returns on our “investment.” We’re citizens, which means we deliberate and act together to obtain prosperity, peace, justice, and all the other values we want to pursue. We ask not just “What kind of country is good for me?” but “What kind of country is good?” Similarly, when it comes to the taxes we pay, we aren’t homo economicus, only pursuing our individual self-interest. There are tens of millions of taxpayers — both those without children and those whose children have grown — who pay property taxes knowing that they support local schools, despite not having children enrolled in them. People who don’t have cars pay taxes that are used to build roads and bridges — and those who use cars pay taxes to support public transit. Young people pay payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare for their elders. We fund research to find cures for diseases most of us will never contract, to aid suffering people in foreign countries, and to provide broadband to communities where we’ll never live.  Despite what people like Vance would have us believe, we all understand intuitively that we do this because we value each other and the future, whether we have children or not. When you learn that Dolly Parton has given away over 200 million books to kids, you don’t say, “What’s wrong with her? She doesn’t have any children, why should she care about anybody else’s?”  If you said that, you’d be some kind of weirdo. Or maybe the next vice president."
