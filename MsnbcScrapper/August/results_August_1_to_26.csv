Hulu’s ‘Baywatch’ doc is a shallow look back at a shallow TV phenomenon,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 12:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hulus-baywatch-doc-glosses-pamela-anderson-cultural-phenomenon-rcna169001,"How did “Baywatch,” the 1990s television show that made Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra household names, insert a specific vision of the California dream in the world’s imagination, turned the red one-piece into a cultural (and sexual) icon, and made the slow-motion run a staple performance for any hottie on the beach. What did this hugely popular show mean for America, and perhaps the world? A new Hulu docuseries, “After Baywatch,” tries to answer just that. Spoiler: It doesn’t. But it does paint an illuminating picture of a shallow, hollow show made up of a shallow, hollow cast, as embodying some of the worst of '90s pop culture. It also explores how the show set the stage for the rapidly devolving cheap entertainment that would eventually bring us reality TV and social media influencers. The most compelling star of “Baywatch” remains the most compelling person several decades later: Pamela Anderson. Anderson, though, didn’t sit for interviews for this documentary. After a life of tabloid exploitation, she has moved back to her Canadian hometown, where she has traded in her signature pencil-thin brows, smokey heavily lashed eyes and over-lined lips for a bare face. She’s been renovating her house. She runs a skin care brand. She’s an animal rights activist. She likes to hang out with her dogs. Anderson isn’t absent from the documentary — filmmakers use old interviews to piece together her storyline — but the documentary’s treatment of her is flat and insubstantial: She was a compelling Playboy model who turned the magazine into a feeder for “Baywatch” talent; the paparazzi were aggressive; a leaked sex tape almost ruined her career but she got through it and, afterward, sex tapes actually catapulted some B-listers like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian to fame. The only somewhat interesting revelation is that David Hasselhoff initially didn’t want Anderson on the show because he worried everyone would be looking at her and not him. In reality, there is much more to say about Anderson, and how she was a mess of contradictions that parallel so much of '90s life for young women: She was super sexy and sexualized, and with that came the presumption that she had no right to privacy even in her most intimate sexual affairs; she partied and had bad taste in men and was happily a little bit trashy, which seemed to give permission to the public to ignore or even tongue-wag at the fact that she was married to a violent domestic abuser — a fact Anderson herself doesn’t seem to have totally processed or addressed, downplaying husband Tommy Lee’s abuse even decades later. Even now, she seems to both want to leave her past behind while not totally reckoning with it. This is not so unlike the broader public’s relationship to the decade that made Anderson famous and the show that helped define it. Paris Hilton, arguably the Pam Anderson of the next decade — blond, beautiful, widely mocked, widely followed, the victim of her own leaked sex tape (made with a man who would go on to marry and divorce Anderson) told a reporter in the early 2000s, “My boyfriends always tell me I’m not sexual. Sexy, but not sexual.” This ideal, that women be sexually performative for men, but not actually sexual for themselves, was at the heart of both “Baywatch” and turn-of-the-century expectations for female celebrities. As the show went on, the legs of the red Baywatch suits got higher-cut and the necklines dropped lower, but the scripts remained cheesy and even wholesome. Sometimes, there just wasn’t enough actual footage to fill the show’s full run-time, and so it was padded with montages of California sunsets, perky butts on beaches, and of course the notorious slo-mo breast-bouncing runs down the sand. The “Baywatch” docuseries, unfortunately, doesn’t do much to address the way in which the show both reflected and perpetuated the decade’s disparate views on female sexuality. And to be fair, the show’s cast — now Botoxed and fillered into the wide-eyed and duck-lipped aesthetic familiar to anyone who has tuned into a Real Housewives episode — simply does not seem capable of, or at least interested in, even the moderate intellectual inquiry required to offer any real insights about the show’s greater impact or meaning. “We had the gorgeous ones,” Hasselhoff observes about the “Baywatch” actresses. “And we had the real ones. But they’re all real. Because they all went in the water.” (His general diagnosis of the show’s quality? “The show — it wasn’t good. But we made it good.”) Carmen Electra takes a stab at assessing the show’s feminist impact by musing, “I think ‘Baywatch’ was ahead of its time. Because the men were featured. And men looked hot.” Actor after actor observes that being in the show “changed” their life. The docuseries, alas, seems unlikely to change anyone’s life, or even deepen anyone’s understanding of “Baywatch;” by the end of the first installment, one begins to wonder how it was even-stretched into four parts (the answer: significant repetition and, like the show itself, many bouncy montages). Perhaps this is the unintentional lesson. Not every cultural artifact has some deeper meaning. Sometimes, people make dumb things, and the rest of us watch because we’re animals who like boobs and washboard abs and the suggestion of sex. The '90s didn’t invent that impulse, although it was the decade in which it arguably went into overdrive. And now, 30 years later, we have an unending glut of sexy-but-not-sexual drivel from reality TV to TikTok. Not to mention a former president (and perhaps future one) who has joined right in, starring in his own reality TV show and having an affair with a porn star that doesn’t sound like it was particularly enjoyable for her. But we also have new language to talk about this cultural coarsening, and new, better standards for the women whose lives and bodies were so often treated as stand-ins for our collective sexual dysfunctions. Pamela Anderson isn’t just living her best life on a Canadian island; she’s been culturally rehabilitated. The paparazzi-harassed and sexually exploited women who followed in her footsteps — Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and so on — have also seen a more feminist public help them to rewrite their stories. While television has been saturated with cheaply made trash, viewers have also rebelled, opening up space for a TV renaissance. The post-“Baywatch” era brought some of the best television ever made to the viewing public. It’s too bad that this much more interesting stuff was ignored in favor of asinine observations and Jeremy Jackson saying he sniffed his fellow cast members’ bathing suits. But this was, for better or worse, “Baywatch”: empty, appealing to little more than a viewer’s most basic impulses, and flimsy as a little red one-piece."
How one doctor’s cooperation could affect the case against the other in Matthew Perry’s death,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 10:14 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/matthew-perry-doctor-plea-deal-ketamine-overdose-rcna169052,"The cooperation of Dr. Mark Chavez, who has agreed to a plea deal in the criminal case stemming from actor Matthew Perry’s fatal ketamine overdose, could help federal prosecutors in California make their case against Dr. Salvador Plasencia, the other doctor who's been charged. Plasencia is indicted alongside Jasveen Sangha, whom prosecutors say is also known as “the Ketamine Queen.” Both have pleaded not guilty. A total of five people have been charged, including Chavez and two others who have already pleaded guilty: Erik Fleming, who admitted to distributing the ketamine that killed Perry, and Kenneth Iwamasa, the actor’s live-in personal assistant. Fleming admitted that he got the ketamine from Sangha and distributed it to Iwamasa. Prosecutors said that Iwamasa conspired with Sangha, Fleming and Plasencia to obtain ketamine illegally and provide it to Perry, and that Iwamasa admitted to repeatedly injecting Perry with the powerful anesthetic without medical training, including multiple times on Oct. 28, 2023, the day the “Friends” actor died. In his plea agreement, Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Plasencia, and prosecutors say he obtained more of the drug for Plasencia by making false representations to a wholesale ketamine distributor and by submitting a fraudulent prescription in the name of a former patient without that patient’s knowledge or consent. A review of the indictment shows how prosecutors might use Chavez to help make their case against Plasencia. One of the more damning allegations refers to text messages between Chavez and Plasencia in which Plasencia discussed how much to charge Perry for ketamine, stating: “I wonder how much this moron will pay” and “Lets find out.” While such evidence speaks for itself and can easily turn a jury against a defendant, having Chavez on the stand to narrate their conversation and speak to the broader alleged conspiracy could strengthen the government’s hand at trial. The indictment references multiple communications and actions between the two doctors, for which Chavez could set the scene and fill in any details.  NBC News reported that a federal judge on Friday accepted Chavez's plea agreement, and that his lawyer said he has already entered into an interim suspension of his medical license that sets up a surrender of it later. “My client wants to do the right thing,” the lawyer, Matthew Binninger, reportedly said. “He’ll be cooperating going forward.” If that cooperation includes trial testimony, defense lawyers would have fodder for cross-examination, as happens in any case with cooperating witnesses. In addition to the incentives that Chavez has to help the government, that he engaged in not only criminal behavior but fraudulent behavior is something else that the defense could focus on. However, to the extent that Chavez’s testimony would be corroborated by other evidence, such as text messages, there may be only so much that defense lawyers could do.  To be sure, it’s early yet in the recently charged case, and the remaining defendants could plead guilty as well. Relatively few cases go to trial. Their lawyers would at least discuss the possibility with them, especially in the face of such potentially damning evidence in a high-profile case.

"Trump headlines Moms for Liberty summit, despite trying to distance himself from Project 2025",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 9:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-moms-for-liberty-heritage-foundation-project-2025-rcna169087,"At the Moms for Liberty annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Donald Trump aired grievances about his political rivals and leaned into culture war issues. In his ""fireside chat,"" he attacked President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and he disparaged trans people and migrants crossing the U.S. border. But aside from his ramblings — which The Guardian described as ""long, zigzagging and at times incoherent"" — the Republican presidential nominee's appearance at the event also underscored his connection to the Heritage Foundation, the architects behind the Project 2025 plan that Trump has taken pains to distance himself from. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization that has served as a personnel pipeline to GOP administrations and crafted policy proposals that have been picked up by Republican officials, has ties to the far-right Moms for Liberty, which has been labeled an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 2022, the organization awarded Moms for Liberty its Salvatori Prize for Citizenship, which came with a $25,000 cash award, according to its tax filing that year. The Heritage Foundation is also one of 10 sponsors of the Moms for Liberty summit this year, as The Washington Post reported. And Moms for Liberty is listed as a “coalition partner” for Project 2025, an action plan for Trump’s second term that was drafted by the Heritage Foundation. Amid public backlash to Project 2025, Trump has tried to separate himself from the document, despite a number of allies and former Trump administration officials' involvement in drafting it. He has disavowed the project and claimed ignorance of the people behind it. But his politics inherently tie him to the organization's sphere of influence, and supporters of Project 2025 have likened Trump's public rejection of the plan to ""two siblings in a fight."" Trump's appearance at the Moms for Liberty event further undermines those efforts. At the event on Friday, he received a personal endorsement from Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, who said that while the group is ""nonpartisan,"" she personally supports Trump for president."

Kamala Harris’ Georgia trip highlights a savvy broader strategy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 31, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-georgia-trip-beat-trump-rcna169018,"This week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz went boldly where no major presidential campaign has gone in several decades… Savannah, Georgia.  This is a big deal because it signals the Harris-Walz campaign is not relying solely on running up vote totals in heavily Democratic Atlanta and its nearby suburbs; Democrats are also trying to narrow the margins in the more conservative, rural areas. In those locations, it is not about actually winning whole towns or counties; it's about losing them by less. The strategy reminds me of how Barack Obama approached the Iowa caucuses in 2007 and his 2004 Senate campaign before that. He showed up in both blue counties and blue cities and in rural counties, small towns and places where many people were surprised to see him.   This was also the strategy Sen. Raphael Warnock implemented in 2020 and 2022 in Georgia. Warnock’s former campaign manager Quentin Folks is now Harris’ principal deputy campaign manager. A rural Georgia native, Folks recently said, “You have to really stave down margins and go places even when you don’t think you can win it outright… You know you’re going to lose that county, but just showing up there can sometimes be the difference between 5 to 10 percentage points, or sometimes just putting an office there.” One bus tour does not win an election, but it does show a willingness by the Harris-Walz campaign to meet people where they are and to put in the work of showing up. As much as politics has changed over the last several years, it turns out there’s still value in a good old fashioned bus tour. On Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment against Donald Trump in Smith’s federal election subversion case. Smith re-tooled the indictment in an effort to take out anything that could violate the Supreme Court’s July ruling on immunity — basically anything that leaned too heavily into Trump’s official role as president.  That meant removing allegations that Trump used the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud, and reshaping the way the indictment described Mike Pence’s role in the election certification process. It also required Smith going to an entirely new grand jury. And while none of that should have been necessary, Andrew Weissmann has pointed out that now five grand juries have found probable cause to believe Trump committed multiple felonies. That’s not a small thing. This trial will not see the inside of a courtroom before the election, and if Trump is elected it probably won’t proceed at all. But for now, Smith isn’t giving up. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a mullet at the DNC. But I think it’s fair to say there will likely be more mullets in the event’s future.  For many, the August convention was their first introduction to John Russell, also known as “mullet guy.” But if you’re on TikTok, you’ve probably known about him for a long time. Whether interviewing labor leaders like UAW president Shawn Fain or educating people about CEO pay, Russell has been making waves as an activist and content creator for years. If you’re interested in hearing more from Russell, make sure to check out his Substack (“The Holler”), or you can find him across social media at the handle @heyjohnrussell. What, besides his trademark hairstyle, makes Russell stand out? It’s not just his self-described role as a “dirtbag journalist” or his background as a seasoned dive bartender — Russell knows how to speak to the party’s base, wherever they are. This fantastic video of him interviewing swing voters in Elliott County, Kentucky is a great example.  You can watch my interview with Russell this Sunday at 12 p.m. ET, where we’ll be talking all things labor, DNC, and mullet maintenance. What show are you bingeing right now? We’re doing a lot of hanging out on YouTube right now. I’ve been really loving Dan Toomey’s show “Good Work.” It does my favorite thing, which is wrapping serious and boring topics in comedy, kind of like how you wrap your dog’s medicine in cheese.  What’s the last book you read? “The Long Deep Grudge: A Story of Big Capital, Radical Labor, and Class War in the American Heartland” by Toni Gilpin.  What time do you wake up on the weekends? When my body tells me to, which depends heavily on the events of Friday night.  How do you take your coffee? In my belly, no matter what’s in the coffee. "
"Vance, confronted with the awful story behind the viral Miss Teen USA clip, says he won’t apologize",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 3:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-meme-miss-teen-usa-caitlin-upton-rcna169003,"GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance tried to mock Kamala Harris over some of her meandering responses in her CNN interview Thursday, posting a clip of a teenage pageant queen who faced years of ridicule after she verbally stumbled during the Miss Teen USA 2007 event. The old viral clip shows 18-year-old Caitlin “Caite” Upton, who was Miss South Carolina Teen USA at the time, flubbing an answer after being asked about Americans’ knowledge of geography. Vance posted the video on X and wrote: “BREAKING: I have gotten ahold of the full Kamala Harris CNN interview.” Upton, who has since appeared on “The Amazing Race” and in a number of commercials, has said that she dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts over the fallout from the incident. In 2015, she told New York Magazine that she “went through a period where I was very, very depressed.” “I had some very dark moments where I thought about committing suicide,” she told the magazine, beginning to tear up. She added: “Sorry, it’s just really emotional. This is the first time I’ve actually been able to talk about it. It was awful, and it was every single day for a good two years.” On Friday morning, Vance told CNN that he was not aware that Upton had contemplated suicide and said that he hoped she is doing well. The Ohio senator went on to say that it would be best to just laugh it off. “Look, I’ve said a lot of things on camera; I’ve said a lot of stupid things on camera,” he said. “Sometimes when you’re in the public eye, you make mistakes. And again, I think the best way to deal with it is to laugh at ourselves, laugh at this stuff and try to have some fun in politics.” Vance also took issue with being asked about the post instead of the “real” crises facing American families, lamenting that “politics has gotten way too lame” and “way too boring.” “You can have some fun while making a good argument to the American people about how you’re going to improve their lives,” he said. When asked if he would apologize, given what he now knows about Upton, Vance replied: Vance’s attempt at scoring internet points — and then his refusal to apologize — was not received well, including by Upton herself. In a post on X on Friday morning, she wrote: “It’s a shame that 17 years later this is still being brought up. There’s not too much else to say about it at this point. Regardless of political beliefs, one thing I do know is that social media and online bullying needs to stop.” Upton’s account appears to have since been deleted."
Trump seeks to leverage immunity ruling in New York hush money case ahead of sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:21 AM PDT / Updated Sept. 4, 2024, 6:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-case-sentencing-federal-court-move-rcna168957,"UPDATE (Sept. 4, 2024, 7:10 a.m. ET): A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Donald Trump's second bid to move his New York hush money case to federal court. UPDATE (Aug. 30, 2024, 5:58 p.m. ET): On Friday, an entry on the federal court docket told Donald Trump’s lawyers that their filing attempting to move Trump’s state criminal case to federal court was deficient, noting that it did not include the opposing party’s consent or the court’s leave to file, which, the docket entry noted, the court had not granted. Ahead of Donald Trump’s sentencing in his so-called hush money case, which is set for Sept. 18 in New York state court, the former president’s lawyers are attempting once again to move the criminal case to federal court. They lost a previous attempt to do so last year, but that was before the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling, which they’re now citing as a reason for the case to proceed in a federal forum. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office “violated the Presidential immunity doctrine in grand jury proceedings, and again at trial, by relying on evidence of President Trump’s official acts during his first term in Office,” Trump’s lawyers wrote in their federal court filing Thursday. While they more vaguely raised the immunity issue in their failed removal attempt last year, they wrote in this latest filing that they “could not have anticipated the subsequent federal developments culminating in Trump v. United States,” referring to the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority’s immunity ruling. That high court decision came in the federal election interference case, where Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion laid out a vague test for determining which official presidential acts are immune from prosecution, as distinct from private acts that aren’t. Trump’s New York state charges — 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, related to an alleged cover-up of a hush money scheme ahead of the 2016 election — didn’t involve official presidential acts. But the issue the immunity ruling raised for the case stems from another part of the Supreme Court ruling, one that curbed the use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of unofficial acts. Trump has a pending motion in state court to overturn his May guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. Judge Juan Merchan set a Sept. 16 deadline to rule on that issue and is scheduled to sentence Trump two days later, assuming the judge rejects Trump’s immunity claim. But that sentencing date was recently put in doubt when Trump’s lawyers asked Merchan to postpone the sentencing, because they want to immediately appeal if he rejects their immunity claim. Bragg’s office didn’t fully object to the further delay, instead saying it would defer to the judge. Merchan hasn’t yet ruled on whether he’ll adjourn the sentencing; Trump’s federal court filing on Thursday said that the judge had told the parties that he would rule on the defense adjournment request “on or before” Sept. 5. Now the Sept. 18 sentencing date is further called into question, pending word from federal court about whether the case will proceed there or get kicked back to Merchan. The more important overall issue in the case, however, is whether the guilty verdicts can stand under the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling or prosecutors will need to retry the case. That question may ultimately need to be answered by the high court. The issue of federal court removal is also at play in the state election interference case in Georgia, where one of Trump’s co-defendants, his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, has a pending Supreme Court petition on the matter, in which Meadows also cites the immunity ruling.

JD Vance nags billionaire Peter Thiel to throw money at Donald Trump's campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 2:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-peter-thiel-donations-rcna169051,"Republicans are shook over Democrats’ fundraising efforts, and we’re starting to see them look for ways to change the momentum.  One sign? Sen. JD Vance is pushing his billionaire benefactor and mentor, Peter Thiel, to throw his financial heft behind the Trump campaign. Thiel, who shares elements of Vance’s brand of far-right, technocratic illiberalism, supported Trump in 2016 and helped fund the senator’s 2022 election bid, but this year Thiel has said he’s not interested in endorsing a candidate after his disappointment with Trump’s presidency. Thiel did say he might change his mind, though. Vance appears to be banking on it.  “I’m going to keep on talking to Peter and persuading him that — you know he’s obviously been exhausted by politics a little bit — but he’s going to be really exhausted by politics if we lose and if Kamala Harris is president,” Vance said in an interview with the Financial Times. “He is fundamentally a conservative guy, and I think that he needs to get off the sidelines and support the ticket.” (A representative for Thiel did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.) Vance is taking a slightly different approach than Trump, who in recent months has openly threatened CEOs who don’t endorse him. And without subpoena power of his own, Vance has also been forced to take a different approach than House Republicans and Republican attorneys general, who’ve opened investigations into the fundraising platform ActBlue, which Democrats have used to notch historic fundraising hauls since Vice President Kamala Harris entrance into the race. “These inquiries point to unspecified allegations of possible foreign money laundering or identity theft supposedly being carried out by bad actors on ActBlue,” Fast Company reported. ActBlue told the outlet, “in 2024, it is all too commonplace to see attempts to spread disinformation from the far-right and our organization is prepared to address the bad actors.” Recent fundraising data give us some insight into what may be driving Republican concerns. The Harris campaign significantly out-raised the Trump campaign in July, which The Washington Post notes may allow her “to air more ads and maintain a larger payroll than her Republican opponent in the final months of the race for the White House.”  There are already signs that the huge fundraising hauls Team Harris has raked in have allowed it to reach out to voters in areas Democrats might have otherwise deprioritized without so much cash on hand. This week, they launched an ad campaign in the area around Trump’s home in Florida.  When you consider all of that, it seems clear why Vance would be pushing for his party's top cash cow to get out of the barn and into the milking shed."
What’s next in Adnan Syed's case after court keeps convictions intact for Hae Min Lee's murder,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 1:34 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/adnan-syed-whats-next-murder-hae-min-lee-rcna168996,"In the Adnan Syed legal saga’s latest step, Maryland’s top court kept intact the convictions of the man whose case was popularized by the “Serial” podcast that raised questions about his guilt. The court was closely divided in Friday’s decision — with nearly 200 pages total written by the majority and dissenting justices — in the appeal that didn’t turn on Syed’s culpability but rather a victim’s rights issue that requires further proceedings in the closely watched case and has broader implications for criminal justice generally.   After being convicted in 2000 of killing Hae Min Lee, Syed’s high school ex-girlfriend, the state’s attorney for Baltimore City moved to vacate Syed’s convictions in 2022. But the problem, as the Supreme Court of Maryland saw it, is that Lee’s brother, Young Lee, wasn’t properly afforded his rights in connection with the 2022 hearing that freed Syed.  The state high court recounted: The lower court granted the state’s motion to vacate Syed’s convictions after that hearing, ordering prosecutors to set a new trial or drop the charges. The state did the latter but Young Lee appealed. An intermediate appeals court said that he had a right to reasonable notice of the hearing and the right to attend in person, yet the appeals court also said that crime victims and their representatives don’t have a right to be heard at the hearing.    On Friday, the state Supreme Court agreed that Young Lee had the right to receive sufficient notice and attend in person, and it further decided that crime victims or their representatives do have the right to be heard.  “Because Mr. Lee’s rights as the crime victim’s representative were violated and Mr. Lee has made a sufficient showing of prejudice, this case will be remanded to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for further proceedings,” the state high court said in the opinion by Justice Jonathan Biran, joined by three other justices over three dissents. “On remand, the parties and Mr. Lee will begin where they were immediately after the State’s Attorney filed the motion to vacate,” Biran wrote, adding that the case needs to go to a new judge, to “avoid the appearance that allowing Mr. Lee and/or his attorney to speak to the evidence at a new vacatur hearing may be a formality.” Though the underlying proceedings sought to remedy a perceived injustice to Syed, the state high court concluded, “the prosecutor and the circuit court worked an injustice against” Young Lee.  And while the court approved the reinstatement of Syed’s convictions, it declined to reincarcerate him. Syed, now 43, was sentenced to life in prison, plus 30 years, for the 1999 strangling of Hae Min Lee. He served more than 20 years before his conviction was overturned in 2022 after prosecutors dropped the charges against him, citing flawed evidence. The matter may well conclude with Syed’s vindication if Young Lee is afforded his rights as outlined by the state court. But it remains uncertain precisely how or when this legal story ends.    Striking a much different tone and raising different concerns, dissenting justices called the case “a procedural zombie” that’s been “reanimated, despite its expiration,” further arguing that the majority created victims’ rights that didn’t exist and that the “new hearing requirements harken back to the days of yore before victim-initiated prosecutions were constitutionally abolished.”  Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

In essence, because the Democratic congressman was already up in the Arizona polls, and because he already was receiving support from Republicans, this was an endorsement he didn’t even seem to need. Which is why it was pretty devastating for Lake. But it’s starting to look pretty damning for Gallego as well. And that’s because just one day after receiving the Arizona Police Association’s endorsement, Gallego wrote a letter to the Justice Department downplaying the findings of a damning DOJ report released in June, which revealed that the Phoenix Police Department had routinely used excessive force and violated the civil rights of racial minorities and homeless people. Gallego’s letter asks the DOJ not to pursue a consent decree — essentially, an agreement in which a police department makes changes overseen by a federal monitor — for Phoenix police. In other words, he opposed one of the most effective means of ensuring that the Phoenix Police Department is held accountable. After the report was released, Phoenix urged the DOJ not to seek a consent decree. And Gallego’s letter essentially echoes the same talking points, claiming that a consent decree would be burdensome for the department and writing that the DOJ’s findings of “a mere 120 or so unspecified incidents” represent an “exceptionally small fraction” of service calls. He also maintained that several of the cases identified by the Justice Department have already been addressed. Gallego — in contrast with Phoenix residents who have spoken out against police brutality in their city — concluded that “it is clear that a pattern or practice of civil rights violations does not exist” and proposed that the DOJ instead pursue what’s known as a technical assistance letter: Gallego’s letter — which you can read in full here — basically asks the DOJ to allow Phoenix police to police themselves. And coming from Gallego, who launched his political career off of his past activism against racial profiling — specifically, Arizona’s controversial “show me your papers” law — the remarks read like a betrayal. They certainly smell of self-interest. Gallego emerged on the political scene as a critic of police discrimination. Now it seems he thinks the best way to advance his career is by downplaying it. Aside from the morality issue, it seems like an unnecessary political risk. Though Gallego has been polling several points ahead of his opponent, the presidential race in Arizona is on track to be much more competitive. And with that in mind, it’s pretty stunning to see a Senate candidate taking needless actions that could discourage the Black and Latino voters Democrats will need if they want Kamala Harris to win in Arizona. Gallego has yet to address the letter publicly, including on his social media platforms. Let’s hope we hear from him on the subject soon."
"Ruby Freeman, Shaye Moss are going after Giuliani's assets now that his bankruptcy case is dismissed",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 1:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/freeman-moss-giuliani-assets-defamation-judgment-rcna169015,"Two Georgia election workers have asked a judge to enforce the almost $150 million defamation judgment in their lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani by forcing him to turn over his luxury properties and a host of other assets. In a filing Friday, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the mother-daughter duo who won a defamation case against the former Trump lawyer over his 2020 election lies, asked a judge to issue an order for Giuliani to turn over his assets and grant them control of the property he fails to turn over, as well as the ability to sell them. “Those remedies are overwhelmingly justified under New York law,” the filing says. “And they are all the more appropriate in the context of this case, where Mr. Giuliani has proven time and again that he will never voluntarily comply with court orders, much less voluntarily satisfy Plaintiffs’ judgment.” Some of the assets Freeman and Moss list are a 1980 Mercedes-Benz, “various items of furniture,” a television, sports memorabilia (including a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt), three Yankee World Series rings and 26 watches. The women’s pursuit of Giuliani’s assets has been a long time coming. Freeman and Moss have yet to begin collecting on the money that Giuliani has owed them since December, when he filed for bankruptcy shortly after they won their suit against him. (Giuliani is appealing that verdict.) However, during bankruptcy proceedings, Giuliani’s creditors accused him of providing false and misleading information about his assets and claimed he was using bankruptcy to avoid payment. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane ultimately decided to dismiss Giuliani’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy altogether, citing in part the disgraced lawyer's lack of cooperation in the proceedings. That dismissal earlier this month opened the door for Freeman and Moss to go after Giuliani's assets as a means to recover some of the money they’re owed. Giuliani has expressed no remorse for his treatment of Freeman and Moss. After he was found to have defamed them, he continued to baselessly accuse them of stealing the 2020 election, until a judge ordered him to stop in May. At the Republican National Convention in July, he told CNN he did not regret his statements and likened his legal troubles to “the Japanese internment” during World War II. In a statement to The Hill about Freeman and Moss’ latest request, Giuliani’s spokesperson Ted Goodman on Friday accused the women’s legal counsel of trying to “harass and intimidate” the disbarred lawyer. “This lawsuit has always been designed to censor and bully the mayor, and to deter others from exercising their right to speak up and to speak out,” Goodman said."
"Nearly six weeks later, Trump can’t shake his fixation on Biden",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 12:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nearly-six-weeks-later-trump-cant-shake-fixation-biden-rcna169047,"At Donald Trump’s latest campaign rally in Michigan, Donald Trump started to share some conspiracy theories about independent polls — which the former president is convinced are “rigged” — when he had a related thought. “You know, we were up massively by Biden,” the Republican said. “How would you like to be me? I spent $100 million on beating Biden.” Moments later, in case the sentiment wasn’t clear the first time, he again said, “I spent $100 million on fighting him.” It was a timely reminder, as a HuffPost report put it this week, “Donald Trump just can’t quit Joe Biden.” For those keeping score, President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21, which was roughly 40 days ago. Common sense suggests Trump, with fewer than 10 weeks remaining before Election Day 2024, would be focusing all of his attention on Harris and not the retiring incumbent. And yet, there was the former president this week, publishing an item to his social media platform that read, “You know, if Biden didn’t do the Debate, he would be the Democrat Candidate for President right now. The fact is, Debate or no Debate, the Democrats really did a number on him!!!” At face value, the GOP candidate’s missive wasn’t wrong — but it was irrelevant given the circumstances. It was nevertheless part of a larger pattern. The day before Trump published that item to his platform, he was in Michigan, whining about Biden ending his candidacy. Six days earlier, the Republican also complained that Biden’s exit was “not fair.” In the preceding days, Trump made related comments, longing for the days in which the incumbent was still running, over and over and over again. What’s more, when the GOP nominee isn’t attacking Biden for no reason, and pleading for Biden to stick around, Trump is peddling fan-fiction about the Democratic president re-entering the 2024 race. To be sure, I’m well aware of the Republican’s motivations. As we’ve discussed, Trump was feeling quite good about the state of the race when Biden was still his opponent. The former president was ahead in the polls; Democrats were divided; and much of the national analysis was about the expanding electoral map, as traditional “blue” states started to appear more competitive. The Republican had reason to be pleased: He was winning. Indeed, Trump’s assumptions about his inevitable victory contributed to his decision to pick an unpopular far-right running mate: As the GOP nominee saw it, he could get away with adding Sen. JD Vance to the ticket — as opposed to a qualified candidate with broader electoral appeal — because the race was effectively over. And now it’s not. But while the former president’s frustrations are understandable, they’re also increasingly pitiful. Biden is retiring after a half-century of honorable public service. The quicker Trump comes to terms with the new landscape, the better off he’ll be. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why Harris and Walz's first major interview was a win for the campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 12:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-tim-walz-interview-cnn-media-rcna169019,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 30 episode of ""José Díaz-Balart Reports."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s first joint interview aired on CNN on Thursday night, and, based on what I saw, the Harris campaign should be quite proud. The candidate at the top of the ticket, Harris, went out and did what she needed to do. As for Walz, the governor was able to speak directly to the American people about the Republican attacks on his military service and set the record straight. For voters outside of Minnesota who are less familiar with Walz, I’m sure they got some of the answers they may have been looking for.  The discourse over the last few weeks would have you believe that Harris hadn’t sat down for an interview since she became the vice president. But the way she handled herself Thursday, it was clear she was comfortable answering questions. CNN’s Dana Bash did a good job at pulling the layers back and digging into what the American people really wanted to hear.  People will always want more, but Thursday’s interview was a great start. Going forward, voters need more opportunities to hear from the Democratic ticket — in various ways — whether that be more sit-down TV interviews, print interviews or gaggles with the media between campaign stops. Overall, there was no harm done to the Harris-Walz campaign during the interview and a little news was broken. As a communications veteran, that’s a win from my perspective.

Let's dispel the myth that Harris will be any different from Biden on Gaza and Israel,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-cnn-biden-rcna168949,"Vice President Kamala Harris said U.S. policy on arming Israel will not change if she is elected president, echoing the Biden administration's line on expressing tepid sympathy for Palestinians being killed and starved in Gaza while staunchly affirming support for Israel's vicious military conduct in the war. In her first interview as the Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday, Harris showed that she is in lockstep with President Joe Biden on the issue, rejecting calls — including from fellow Democrats — to withhold weapons from Israel over its siege on Gaza. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 40,000 people so far and injured more than 93,000, according to health officials in Gaza. “Let me be very clear: I am unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself, and that’s not going to change,” Harris told CNN when asked whether she would halt “some” arms shipments to Israel. She went on to talk in detail about Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, which killed 1,200 people. “As I said then, I say today: Israel ... has a right to defend itself. We would,” she said. “And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” When asked flat-out whether her policy would differ from Biden's on ""arms and so forth,"" Harris said no. She then spoke about the urgency in landing an agreement to release the hostages held by Hamas and secure a cease-fire in Gaza, a deal she said would end the war and “unlock so much of what must happen next.” “I remain committed since I’ve been on Oct. 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and, in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,” she added. Conditioning weapons shipments to Israel has been a chief demand from pro-Palestinian activists. Biden himself had threatened to withhold supplying arms to Israel over its assault on Gaza in May, but that threat ultimately proved empty. If there was any hope that Harris’ approach would be meaningfully different than Biden’s — that she might stop providing political and unconditional military support to Israel in this war, and that she might be willing to seriously pressure Israel to adhere to international law in its military operations in Gaza — those hopes were entirely crushed by her remarks on Thursday. As vice president, Harris’ rhetoric on the deep suffering of Palestinians set her apart from the Biden administration’s actions. Her comments afforded Biden some political cover, and after he withdrew his re-election bid, there was optimism that a Harris administration would take a more just, humane position. But as a presidential candidate herself now, Harris is showing that she is ultimately no more politically or morally courageous on this issue than Biden."
This ‘very demure’ TikTok star is being ‘very mindful’ about getting credit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/demure-tiktok-jools-lebron-handled-trademark-rcna168843,"“Very demure, very mindful” has caused a situation that’s become very contentious. TikTok creator Jools Lebron captivated the platform with her videos about cultivating the right look for work and, in the span of a couple of weeks, spawned a viral meme, a spate of celebrity responses, a Verizon ad and an appearance on ABC’S “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” But shortly after the store cashier’s catchphrase went viral, several people separately rushed to register variations of “very demure” as federal trademarks. None of them have any kind of relationship with Lebron. Jefferson Bates applied for “Very Demure .. Very Mindful ..” on Aug. 20 as a trademark for advertising, marketing and promotional services; Kassandra Pop sought “very demure very cutesy” on Aug. 24 for advertising services; and Almondia White filed for “always demure and very mindful” on Aug. 27 for hats and apparel. Those applications, made by people trying to exploit the virality of Lebron’s phrases, left her bereft and her fans enraged. Amid tears on a recent TikTok, Lebron says, “This merch situation is really f---ing me up. I invested so much money and time in this, and I feel like I did it wrong. Like, I feel like I didn’t try hard enough. I wanted this to do so much for my family and provide for my transition, and I just feel like I dropped the ball.” At the end of the brief recording, Lebron says, “I, like, don’t even know what I could have done better because I didn’t have the resources.” Those other people’s applications, while perhaps tacky, are not necessarily doomed to fail. A trademark is a source indicator — it tells potential purchasers who makes or stands behind a product, not who named it. Trademark law does not care who popularized a word or phrase, only who used it first (or applied to register it first) in connection with the sale of goods or services. But neither are the applications by those who beat Lebron to the punch guaranteed to succeed. Each will be examined by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and published for opposition, a process that can take between six and nine months. Anyone who believes, as Lebron does, that the registration will harm their business, can argue that it should be refused. Each of the three pending applications was filed based on the applicant’s stated plan to use the mark in the future, so they’ll eventually need to demonstrate that they’re using the mark in commerce — which they have up to three years to do. Fewer than half of intent-to-use based applications eventually turn into registered marks, and the odds of abandonment are likely higher for applications to register viral phrases. There are also a handful of reasons that the USPTO might refuse these applications, either of its own accord or in response to opposition by Lebron. One is use: a phrase has to be used as a trademark to gain protection. If White, for example, simply sells T-shirts that say “always demure and very mindful” across the front, that’s considered an ornamental use, not a trademark use, and it wouldn’t earn her a registration. Instead, she would need to print the phrase on tags inside or attached to the shirt to show that it’s her brand. The USPTO might determine that the “demure” phrases are too ubiquitous to function as trademarks and conclude that the public won’t associate them with a particular source because they function more like informational slogans or rallying cries. Hashtags like #SayHerName and expressions like “God Bless the USA” have been refused registration on that basis. Another way Lebron might come out on top is by establishing priority. If she can show she used the phrase first — not just in videos or appearances, but as a brand name in connection with products she sold or services she provided — then she can show her rights predate theirs, and the other marks will be refused registration if they create a likelihood of confusion with hers. Much of the internet rushed to judgment after Lebron’s tearful TikTok, and some of her loyal followers accused Bates of stealing Lebron’s thunder. That said, the feeling that the phrase is closely associated with Lebron could work in her favor in the trademark process if the USPTO thinks that consumers will be deceived by someone else’s use of her catchphrase as a mark. The office rejected an application for “fear the brow” as a trademark for clothing in 2011 on the grounds that consumers who purchased goods bearing the mark might believe themselves to be supporting then-Kentucky Wildcats basketball player Anthony “The Brow” Davis. But he had nothing to do with that application. In a much happier video posted Tuesday, Lebron said of the trademark situation, “We got it handled, and I’m gonna leave it that. We got it handled. Mama got a team now.” She didn’t provide more details. Lebron’s struggle to capitalize on her cultural contributions is representative of the challenges that creators, and particularly creators of color, have long faced. As I wrote in my essay in the book “Feminist Cyberlaw,” “access to formal intellectual property protection requires access to information, capital, and expertise.” That’s essentially the point that Lebron made in the TikTok about the other trademark applications, when she said she didn’t know what she could have done better “because I didn’t have the resources.” As I wrote for ""Feminist Cyberlaw,"" “intellectual property laws are structured to privilege and protect some forms of innovation, commerce, and art over others—and those forms of knowing and creating tend to be predominantly white and male.… [T]he creative and entrepreneurial endeavors of women, people of color, and members of other marginalized groups are less likely to be rewarded with protection and exclusive rights.” Lebron could mean any number of things when she says her team “got it handled.” She may file her own trademark applications, plan to oppose other attempts to register marks that build on her work, send cease-and-desist letters, file lawsuits alleging trademark infringement, attempt to negotiate with the other applicants, or any combination of those. Her team might also try to cultivate backlash against the interlopers and publicly shame them into abandoning their applications. That strategy led Disney to walk away from its application to register “Día de los Muertos” and Momofuku to cease enforcing its registration for “chili crunch” against competitors. Because while Lebron is known for being demure, her lawyers don’t have to be."
"Against election backdrop, economic growth beats expectations (again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 10:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-backdrop-economic-growth-beats-expectations-rcna169008,"As August got underway, there was a sharp and unexpected downturn on Wall Street. As a recent New York Times report summarized, it was easy to explain: Investigators grew skittish due to a combination of a disappointing jobs report, trouble in Japanese markets, and concerns that the Federal Reserve had waited too long to lower interest rates. For Donald Trump and his party, however, the truth was clearly inadequate, so they rewrote it. In the Republicans’ version of reality, the brief Wall Street slide was obviously Vice President Kamala Harris’ fault. From the Times’ article: The rhetorical push was, of course, utterly ridiculous. The idea that a sitting vice president is responsible for brief and entirely predictable stock-market losses was absurd, but the GOP candidate and his allies expected voters to believe it anyway. At least, that is, that was the Republicans’ message four weeks ago. As August comes to end, Americans are no longer hearing much about the “Kamala Crash,” in large part because there’s been no crash. All of the losses from earlier in the month have been regained, and as NBC News reported, economic growth in the United States continues to look good. The latest data is roughly in line with the kind of quarterly GDP reports we saw across much of Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency — when Republicans said Americans saw the greatest economy in the history of humanity. The results also poses a challenge for the former president and his allies, which they haven’t even tried to address: If voters are supposed to believe that Harris is directly responsible for the world’s largest economy, how much credit are Trump and the GOP prepared to give the incumbent vice president for 3% GDP growth? As for the Republicans’ crystal ball, four years ago, Trump told supporters that Democratic policies would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” He’s begun making similar predictions ahead of Election Day 2024. Everything Trump said and predicted was wrong — and the former president hasn’t even tried to explain why his predictions were so hilariously misplaced, or why anyone should believe his new predictions in light of his awful track record.

Why Kamala Harris is messaging Latino voters without using the word 'Latino',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 9:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-poll-latino-hispanic-voter-election-rcna168830,"It’s still early days, but Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance among Latino voters is looking promising. According to a Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday, 56% of Latino registered voters prefer Harris, compared to 34% for former President Donald Trump. That’s a significant surge from when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July; at that time the same poll found Harris was leading by just 6 percentage points, 44% to 38%. This comes as recent polling data from Equis Research, a research organization focused on the Latino electorate, has found that Harris’ entry into the race has let Democrats “reset” with Latinos and that she is outperforming Biden’s 2024 campaign with this demographic.  Yet despite this good news, Harris has yet to reach Biden’s levels of Latino support in the 2020 campaign, according to Equis. As she looks to rebound even further with Latinos, Harris’ campaign is trying a new tack: approaching them pretty similarly to the way they approach all American voters. As The New York Times notes, Harris’ first ad targeting Latino voters, released a few weeks ago, departed from Democrats’ standard messaging toward the demographic in a striking manner. The ad begins with a mention of Harris’ “immigrant mother,” but it makes no explicit mention of Latino identity or immigration as a policy issue. Instead, it discusses Harris’ record and commitment to fighting corporate exploitation, lowering costs of housing and drug prices, and defending abortion rights. In other words — the same set of issues that Harris has been hammering home in her campaign appearances. The ad represents a gamble: Democrats are experimenting with a new approach to attracting one of the most important demographics in the American electorate in a tight race. But it’s one I’m cautiously optimistic about, because what Democrats were doing previously wasn’t working terribly well. Latino voters have leaned toward Democrats for decades. But they are not a monolith. For example, a majority of Cuban American registered voters identified as Republicans in 2020, in part because of their familiarity with and objections to the left-wing government in Cuba. Moreover, Latinos are a relatively young demographic and their views are in flux. Trump performed better with Latinos in 2020 than he did in 2016, and since then Latinos have continued to identify with Republican Party in even greater numbers. Biden was looking even worse this time around with the demographic until he dropped out. For some people, this is counterintuitive. Trump’s offensive comments about immigrants, draconian immigration policies and his nationalism might seem like they would turn off a community of voters who often have ties to recent immigrants — or are immigrants themselves. But the data makes it clear that it’s a mistake to assume that Latinos are categorically different from other Americans when it comes to their positions on immigration and how much they care about the issue. Earlier this year, Equis found that Latinos in seven battleground states trusted Trump more than Biden on immigration policy. And despite the trope of Latinos as immigration focused, polls find that they’re far more concerned about the economy than anything else —  just like most Americans. In other words, it’s not only a mistake to assume Latinos are immigration doves, but also that it’s a top tier issue for them. Harris has wisely declined to focus heavily on her own racial and gender identity in her campaign, instead placing her focus squarely on kitchen table issues. An approach to Latino voters that channels that same energy — with some targeted tweaks in tone and framing, as the aforementioned ad did effectively — is consistent with that attitude.  There are reasons to think it could bear fruit. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign was unusually effective at garnering Latino voters, something his Latino press secretary, Belén Sisa, attributed in part to his class-first approach. Here’s how she explained his popularity among Latinos in an interview in 2020: Harris’ economic policy platform isn’t nearly as progressive as that of Sanders, but its focus on lowering costs and calling out corporations could resonate similarly. Of course, messaging alone won’t do the trick —  Sanders’ campaign made a serious push to aggressively invest in Latino outreach from the very beginning of its campaign. Carlos Odio, a co-founder of Equis, recently emphasized to New York Magazine that Latinos are “the swingiest element of the electorate more broadly, are these low-propensity irregular voters who don’t have fully formed partisan identities.” One thing we know about swing voters and irregular voters is that they care a ton about the economic picture. To win this election, Harris has to paint a good one. "

Why Trump’s new line on IVF is so difficult to take seriously,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-line-ivf-difficult-take-seriously-rcna168975,"A week, apropos of nothing, Donald Trump published a one-sentence missive to his social media platform. “The Republican Party is charging forward on many fronts,” the former president wrote, “and I am very proud that we are a LEADER on I.V.F.” And what, pray tell, would that mean in practice? Six days later, a possible answer came into sharper focus. NBC News reported: “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump said before adding, “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.” The wording led to some confusion about the relevant policy details. Does the Republican nominee, who didn’t pursue anything along these lines during his four years in the White House, envision a model in which the federal government would pick up the tab for IVF services — comparable to an existing policy on dialysis — or one in which private insurers would be forced to cover the costs? When NBC News sought clarification, the former president said that one option would be to have insurance companies pay “under a mandate, yes.” When CNN asked vice presidential nominee JD Vance how this would work in states that ban IVF, he didn’t have much of an answer, either. It seems, in other words, as if Team Trump has some homework to do when it comes to how all of this would work. Still, this is an unusually progressive announcement from a radically far-right candidate, isn’t it? It would be, if the GOP candidate’s rhetoric were believable. Indeed, the Harris campaign responded to the news with a press statement featuring several notable bullet points: We could go further down this same path, noting just how many of Trump’s own allies are looking forward to his prospective second term precisely so that they can undermine IVF access. For that matter, given that Trump tried to repeal, undermine, and sabotage the Affordable Care Act, it’s probably best to take all of his promises related to health care with a grain of salt. But I’m also struck by the broader policy circumstances. For many years, Republicans have condemned the idea of socialized health care coverage and staunchly opposed private insurance benefit mandates. And yet, here’s Trump, looking for a winning campaign issue, insisting that Americans’ IVF treatments will be covered, either through socialized health care coverage or a private insurance benefit mandate. The party’s principles on health care are firm and inviolable — except when they’re not."
"In interview, Harris vows to include a Republican in her Cabinet",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 7:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/interview-harris-vows-include-republican-cabinet-rcna168968,"In her first major television interview since President Joe Biden ended his re-election plans, Vice President Kamala Harris broke some new ground with CNN’s Dana Bash: The Democratic nominee vowed to appoint at least one Republican to her White House Cabinet if elected. As The Washington Post reported: She prefaced her comments by saying, “I’ve got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would, I think, [add bipartisanship to the White House Cabinet]. I think it’s really important.” The vice president didn’t reference any Republicans by name, though it’s easy to identify some of the GOP figures who’d be in contention. After all, Harris has already received endorsements from a variety of notable Republicans — some of whom are currently in office, others who are former officials — and Democrats included several GOP speakers at the party’s national convention in Chicago. It’s worth noting for context that this wasn’t just a stray comment for Harris: Before the interview even aired in its entirety on CNN, the Democrat’s campaign issued a press statement promoting the vow about adding a Republican to her prospective Cabinet and encouraging people to watch a video excerpt of her comments. In other words, Team Harris leaned into this one. There’s no great mystery as to why: Trump appears to have overwhelming support on the right, but the Democratic candidate believes she can assemble an electoral coalition that includes independents and GOP voters who might be skeptical of their party’s scandal-plagued nominee. The Cabinet vow bolsters her credibility on bipartisanship. What’s more, it ties Harris to a modern, pre-Trump tradition of sorts. The Washington Monthly’s Bill Scher — in a piece published before the CNN interview — explained, “[A] modicum of cross-pollination in a cabinet is historically common. Every president, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Barack Obama, had at least one cabinet member from the opposite party for some time during their administrations. Obama appointed three Republicans to his cabinet, including Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former CIA Director Robert Gates as secretaries of defense, and his Illinois colleague, Representative Ray LaHood, as transportation secretary.” Trump broke the streak, and despite his many bipartisan victories, Biden hasn’t had any GOP members on his Cabinet. Harris, however, apparently intends to restore the modern trend. Will Trump respond in kind with a comparable promise? It’s possible, though it’s difficult to imagine what Democrat would agree to join his team."
Why plans for the next presidential debate still aren’t finalized,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/plans-presidential-debate-still-arent-finalized-rcna168955,"Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are scheduled to appear together on a debate stage in just 11 days. Whether that will actually happen isn’t nearly as clear as it should be. It appeared that there was a breakthrough of sorts earlier this week. On Tuesday afternoon, the former president, who’s struggled for weeks to make up his mind about participating in the Sept. 10 event, announced in a written statement that the two major-party campaigns had “reached an agreement,” and the debate would be aired on Sept. 10, as planned. In the same online missive, the Republican claimed that “the Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate,” suggesting the candidates’ microphones will be muted except when they’re answering questions, just as his team had hoped. Soon after, Team Harris explained that negotiations about the microphone issue were still ongoing, Trump’s statement to the contrary notwithstanding. That was Tuesday. Two days later, an Associated Press report suggested the underlying questions had been answered. Around the same time as the AP report reached the public, the Trump campaign hosted a press call, assured reporters that the mic issue had been “worked out,” and as the Republican operation wanted, “the microphones will be off.” So, that’s that? No. As NBC News reported, Harris campaign spokesman Brian Fallon added soon after in a statement issued via social media, “Our latest understanding is that even though Trump said Monday he would be fine with an unmuted mic, his handlers don’t trust him to spar live with VP Harris and are asking ABC to ignore Trump’s comments and keep the mics muted or else they will back out of the debate for a third time.” The spokesperson for the Democratic nominee continued, “We have been asked to accede to Trump’s handlers’ wishes on this point for the sake of preserving the debate. We find the Trump team’s stance to be weak, and remain in discussions with ABC on the final rules.” All of which suggests the negotiations have not been finalized, despite the claims from the GOP campaign. As for why, exactly, this seemingly obscure point has become so contentious, there’s no great mystery here. An NBC News report explained, “Inside the Harris campaign, the thinking is that there shouldn’t be guardrails, and that viewers should see a full, unbridled Trump. Officials there argue that Trump’s handlers don’t trust their own candidate and charge that for all the talk of Biden showing cognitive decline, it’s Trump who is struggling to stay on track with his arguments. Showing him unleashed only benefits Harris.” Indeed, Team Harris hasn’t been subtle on this point. Brian Fallon told Politico on the record this week, “Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. We suspect Trump’s team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit they don’t think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.” It’s difficult to say with confidence when, whether, or how this will be resolved, but time is obviously running out.

New details suggest Trump’s Arlington controversy won’t end soon,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 5:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-details-suggest-trumps-arlington-controversy-wont-end-soon-rcna168944,"Donald Trump’s Arlington National Cemetery controversy was already a mess for the former president, though a statement from the U.S. Army took the fiasco to a new level on Thursday morning. An Army spokesperson began by emphasizing, in writing, that those participating in Monday’s wreath-laying ceremony were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and Pentagon policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. But just as notably, the Army spokesperson went on to explain that an employee who works at the cemetery attempted to ensure adherence to the rules when she was “abruptly pushed aside,” despite Trump campaign denials about a physical altercation. According to the Army, the employee “acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption.” In case this isn’t obvious, the Army generally goes out of its way to avoid issuing provocative statements related to politicians, especially during a campaign, but in this case, the branch made an exception. For his part, the Republican nominee delivered public remarks on the matter for the first time hours later, misstated the date of his visit to Arlington, bragged about being on time for the event at the cemetery, characterized himself as a victim of smear, and concluded that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “killed” American service members in Afghanistan. If that sounds ridiculous and offensive, it’s because it was ridiculous and offensive. Around the same time, Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, on the heels of publicly criticizing the official who works at the cemetery, issued a statement online that called the office of the Army Secretary a bunch of “hacks.” So to recap, the former president — who remains burdened by a dreadful record related to respecting U.S. troops and veterans — isn’t just caught up in a controversy about exploiting one of the nation’s most sacred spaces and ignoring Arlington’s rules against politicization, his campaign team is simultaneously picking a public fight with the United States Army less than 10 weeks from Election Day. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, there’s a burgeoning conversation about uncovering answers that have not yet reached the public. Politico reported: VoteVets, a progressive veterans group, wasted little time in throwing its public support behind the Democratic senator’s efforts, and there’s a related push underway from several House Democrats. Mark Esper, who served as Trump’s Defense Secretary, has also called for an investigation into the incident. Where will the controversy go next? Watch this space."
Kamala Harris is reaching out to rural voters. That will help her win — and govern.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-bus-tour-rural-voters-rcna168615,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' barnstorming tour of rural Georgia showed not only her plan to win the election, but also how she would govern as president. While Donald Trump has long made clear that his only priority is ""his"" voters, Harris' bus tour of Southeast Georgia with running mate Tim Walz showed that she knows the president is supposed to represent every American. Over two days, Harris and Walz met with voters, students and business owners before Harris held a solo rally in Savannah on Thursday. The campaign says this was the first time a general election presidential nominee stumped in the coastal city of Savannah since the 1990s. Bill Clinton and Al Gore also prioritized rural parts of the state on a similar bus tour during their successful 1992 campaign (the last time Democrats picked up Georgia in a presidential election before President Joe Biden and Harris narrowly flipped the state back in 2020). But the investment in the Harris-Walz campaign’s playbook to defend toss-up Georgia goes beyond the bus. It expands their footprint across the state, what the campaign calls the “largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle.”  Earlier this month on “The Weekend,” Harris-Walz's principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks (who led Georgia Sen. Raphael’s Warnock’s successful statewide run), said the campaign’s rural voter outreach demonstrates how Harris would run an “inclusive” administration. Fulks added that Harris and Walz are “fighting for all Americans regardless of if your county votes red or your county votes blue.”   Harris’ “inclusive” campaign strategy isn’t reserved for just the Peach State. Harris and Walz kicked off their bus tour earlier this month, meeting with voters in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, a county Trump won in 2020 by nearly 18 points. And Walz hosted his first solo rally in his home state of Nebraska. The Cornhusker State is one of two states that divides up electoral votes by congressional district. While most of Nebraska is red, Harris and Walz hope to secure the electoral vote in the state’s swing 2nd District. That strategy is about raw vote totals, but it’s also about the ethos of Harris’ campaign. “I promise to be a president for all Americans,” the vice president said during her convention acceptance speech. “You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power,” Harris declared. Georgia voters know a thing or two about the need to preserve free and fair elections. Trump and his allies worked to nullify their votes in 2020, and Georgia Democrats are already bracing for Trump’s effort to possibly challenge election results in November. The DNC and Democratic Party of Georgia sued the Georgia State Election Board this week over new rules they fear could interfere with the vote certification. An overwhelming win by Harris in the state would make it harder for Trump and his allies to overturn the results. That’s why the campaign is working to reach voters in every part of the state, no matter their ZIP code.   But Harris’ plan to win Georgia sends a clear message to voters in other states: She’s ready to serve every American. Listening to the voices of Americans across the political spectrum will not just help her campaign; it will help her govern.

Why Kamala Harris is getting the last laugh after Trump’s CNN interview criticism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:26 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 29, 2024, 8:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cnn-interview-rcna168598,"The hype preceding Kamala Harris’ first and utterly unremarkable “sit-down” interview as a 2024 presidential candidate is a reminder that nobody running against Donald Trump is ever graded fairly. Imagine arguing that Harris, an elected district attorney, attorney general of California, U.S. senator and incumbent vice president, should treat an interview with a CNN reporter as a high-stakes affair; that is, that she could say something that made her appear less qualified than Trump. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, apparently believing Trump’s ticket needed even more misogyny, suggested in a social media post Thursday that Harris would be incapable of holding her own. It is as it has ever been since Trump has been on the political stage: We watch to see if anything Trump says isn’t a lie, and we watch to see if other politicians say anything that’s the least bit false. In an ideal world, nobody would have been sitting on the edge of their seats wondering if Harris would sound knowledgeable or prepared for an interview — if only because she could never sound less knowledgeable or less prepared than her opponent so often does. The interest in the CNN sit-down was elevated, though, in large part because the media had made it such a big issue that she hadn’t done such an interview in the first place. And along with the suggestions that a candidate is deliberately avoiding the media come the suggestions that she’s afraid of the media. Harris exhibited no such fear Thursday. She came across as the typical politician — and I mean that in every sense. She directly answered the questions that she thought would benefit her candidacy, and she was deliberately evasive on specifics. To her credit, I think that the American media has wrongly contributed to what I’ll call the fetishization of a president’s first day in office. No, the vice president didn’t give a convincing answer when asked what she’d do “day one,” and yes, CNN’s Dana Bash asked the question again in a bid to try to force her to answer it. But the bigger problem isn’t so much that Harris didn’t give a straight answer; it’s an absurd question — even if it’s one that political journalists have come to think they have to ask. In setting the stage for the interview, recorded at Kim’s Café in Savannah, Georgia, CNN showed a clip of Trump saying of Harris, “She’s not a smart person.” That’s the same tack Vance took in his social media post that likened Harris to a young beauty contestant completely overwhelmed by an interview question. It’s hard to know exactly what part of that attack on Harris’ smarts we should assign to sexism and which part we should assign to racism. But there’s no denying the presence of both. Former President Barack Obama, president of the Harvard Law Review and a “senior lecturer” in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, was one of the most cerebral presidents we’ve seen, and, yet, there were billboards and bumper stickers that, referring to the country where his father was born, read, “Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing its idiot.” But Harris, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem recently pointed out, doesn’t want to get trapped in questions about identity. We saw that when she addressed Bash’s question about Trump’s lying and saying she only recently described herself as Black. She told Bash, “Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.” Nor did she focus on race and sex when asked about the viral photo of her grandniece watching her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. She said she wants to be the president for everybody. Her opponents are going to work hard, though, to reduce her to those elements of her identity. And slyly suggest that because of those elements she’s not up to the task. But they’re the ones seemingly not up to the task, seeing as how they set a bar so low that she couldn’t help but sail right over it. In response to the interview, Trump described it as “BORING!!!” He wasn’t wrong about that. But I think Harris is banking on voters’ choosing boring over the drama — no, let’s be real and call it the chaos — that Trump inevitably brings."
