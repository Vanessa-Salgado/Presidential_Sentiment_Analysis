The most confounding similarity between Elon Musk and Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-election-2024-donald-trump-rcna165219,"There are a lot of unfortunate similarities between billionaire Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump. Both are petty and small-minded and crave the adulation of some of the most toxic people on the internet. But the most confounding connection hovers over Musk’s administration of X, just as it did over Trump’s White House, which is the question: “Just how much of this is on purpose?” Since acquiring X in late 2022, Musk has worked overtime to take a sledgehammer to what he’s perceived as the website’s faults. He’s laid off most of the staff, instituted wild swings in content moderation policy and otherwise broken what was once a vital part of the information ecosystem. The damage done is coming into sharp focus ahead of this fall’s presidential election, as a series of actions from the site broadly, and from Musk himself, raise suspicions of the reactionary CEO’s putting his thumb on the scale for Trump. After the success of a “Black Women for Harris” call on Zoom, another group, “White Dudes for Harris,” quickly followed its lead with a Zoom fundraiser of its own — raking in $4 million to support Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. But during that same call, the group’s X account, @dudes4harris, was suspended. Many quickly pointed fingers at Musk, accusing him of suspending the account because of its success and trying to keep more X users from donating. It’s not insignificant that just days before, Musk retweeted a Harris parody ad, in which a deepfake version of Harris appeared to call herself “the ultimate diversity hire.” Despite being a deepfake — digitally altering video of Harris’ mouth to match a voiceover — there was no label to indicate the video was manipulated, potentially breaking X’s own policies. Meanwhile, the “artificial intelligence” tool that Musk ordered built for the platform, Grok, has put out misleading info of late, falsely claiming that Harris has missed the ballot deadline in key swing states after President Joe Biden dropped out last month. And as CNBC reported, a federal political action committee that Musk created set up a website that claimed to help viewers register to vote. People with ZIP codes in battleground states, however, got no such help, instead only having their personal data collected. The last two of those have prompted major concern from election officials. A group of five secretaries of state drafted an open letter to Musk to call him to task for Grok’s misinformation and urge him to fix the bot’s output. Separately, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who signed on to that letter, also informed CNBC that her office is investigating whether America PAC’s information-gathering bait-and-switch was a violation of state election law. To be sure, none of the above cases are slam dunk evidence of shady practices at Musk’s X. The PAC’s webpage could just be broken, as one person with knowledge of its operations told CNBC that the links in question once worked — which tracks with Musk’s generally incompetent management of the site formerly known as Twitter. Experts likewise told CNBC that it’s unclear whether any Michigan laws were violated, even if it weren’t merely an innocent snafu. Grok’s promoting misinformation about ballots could also be less about Musk’s own issues and more about the shoddy state of AI in general. As for the “White Dudes for Harris” account’s being suspended? The Washington Post reported it was taken down for hours “because of ‘a user report’ for ‘violating [X’s] rules against evading suspension.” It’s not unthinkable that an unofficial account with no direct link to the Harris campaign’s blowing up that quickly — and asking people for money — tripped an internal alarm to ward off potential fraud. It’s a morass of high-stakes chaos and confusion, and it’s bringing up memories of Trump’s time in office for me. From the beginning of his administration, his increasingly sycophantic staffers transformed his whims into policy — and the results were frantic and volatile. But especially in the early days, it was often valid for an observer to stop and wonder how much of what we were seeing was normal government activity tinged through the lens of Trumpism versus actual departures from the norm. In those moments, it was likewise usually up in the air how much of the stress test of the system was the result of incompetence or deliberately plotted extremism. What I came to realize then, though, is that the answer to “is this incompetence or malice” all too often is “it doesn’t matter.” Intention was, and is, less important than the real-world effects of what we’re seeing. Whether due to malevolence or being terrible at his job, Musk has made X into a cesspool for anyone hoping to find the truth. And the reality is that as Musk has become more openly revanchist in his worldview, X has become a platform that is all too willing to let right-wing misinformation spread. It’s a forgoing of responsibility that is having deadly impact in the United Kingdom — and could have similarly disastrous effects if left unchecked during the U.S. election."
Why the Sept. 10 debate is shaping up to be a win-win for Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-debate-harris-kamala-sept-fox-rcna165178,"Former President Donald Trump is reportedly chickening out of the second presidential debate, insisting on a new date, setting and format that he thinks will favor him. But Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, plans to appear at the initially scheduled place and time — Sept. 10 on ABC — regardless of whether or not Trump shows. It’s a smart move that’ll help lay bare both Trump’s self-doubt, and his lack of interest in anything civic-minded that doesn’t help him. For months, Trump obsessed over the idea of a debate against President Joe Biden, framing his eagerness as “for the good of the country.” He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last year that he was ready to do “10 debates” with the president. In May, Biden’s and Trump’s campaigns agreed on the format for two presidential debates. And after Biden’s disastrous first debate performance, Trump didn’t express hesitation over the second debate scheduled for September and moderated by ABC News. But with Biden out of the race and with Harris set to replace him, Trump’s thinking has changed. He posted on Truth Social on Friday that the agreement he had made with Biden was “terminated” because “Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network …. thereby creating a conflict of interest.”  Neither excuse makes sense. Trump’s lawsuit against ABC — concerning anchor George Stephanopoulos’ saying Trump had been found “liable for rape” — was filed in March, weeks before he agreed to the ABC debate. And Trump and Biden didn’t just to agree to the debate because they thought it’d be a good time. They did so because they were considered de facto nominees for their parties. Now Harris is all but certain to be the nominee, so it only makes sense that she would take Biden’s place in the debate.  Indeed, Trump isn’t even pretending the debate is entirely off. He has instead proposed a new date and — more important — a new format. The debate, he says, should be held on Trump-worshipping turf at Fox News, and it should take place before a “full arena audience.”  Trump’s new debate terms give the game away. Now that he fears embarrassment against an energetic new candidate who can communicate far more effectively than her predecessor, he wants to rig the environment with moderators and audience members who are far more likely to make him look more competent, reasonable and well-liked than his opposition. This ploy tracks with Trump’s prior attitudes toward debates. While Trump was gunning for months for a debate with Biden, he refused to participate in a single debate in the Republican presidential primaries. Rather than participate for the “good of the country” or even just his party, he sought to delegitimize the Republican debates and even held events simultaneously to draw viewers away from them. His goal was clear: to sideline the opposition and turn the primaries into a coronation. And the result was equally clear: Trump showed disdain for the idea of public accountability and informing the public about his record or future policies. Trump’s threat to no-show the Sept. 10 debate makes Harris’ appearance that night a win-win scenario. If Trump doesn’t show up, she’ll get a sizable (albeit most likely more modest) prime-time audience and an opportunity to speak at length with the American people about her background, her policies and her vision of the future. Moreover, Trump’s non-appearance will generate countless headlines making him look cowardly. If, on the other hand, Trump reverses course and shows up, Harris will have an opportunity to showcase her policies and draw a contrast with her mendacious, rambling and authoritarian opponent. Trump will no longer benefit from going up against a candidate who was no longer fit for the debate stage. Regardless of how this shakes out, the entire back-and-forth works to Harris’ benefit. Trump looks afraid, and his desire to set up contests only where he thinks he can win is evident for all to see."
Kamala Harris is getting the thing Donald Trump always craves: attention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 3:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-donald-trump-games-attacks-attention-rcna165254,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 4 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Kamala Harris could announce her running mate at any moment, with the vice president set to reveal her pick ahead of their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday.  But the fact is, no matter whom she chooses, the announcement of this pick will only build even more momentum for the Harris campaign.  The vice president has already held a series of big, energizing rallies, like last week’s event in Atlanta featuring Megan Thee Stallion, where the rapper coined the phrase “Hotties for Harris.” She’s also brought on all-star campaign veterans like David Plouffe, Stephanie Cutter, Jennifer Palmieri and Mitch Stewart — adding to an already seasoned team.  The money continues to pour in at a crazy pace. The Harris campaign said this week they raised a record-breaking $310 million in July. She’s also up in the polls. Harris has a one-point edge nationally over Donald Trump, and the two are neck and neck across the collective battleground states, according to a new CBS News poll. Harris’ momentum is clear to anyone watching. What’s also clear is that all the attention on Harris is driving Trump kind of crazy — and he is twisting himself into a pretzel as a result.   At his rally on Saturday in Atlanta, Trump said some very strange things. Like when he congratulated President Vladimir Putin of all people for the historic prisoner swap that freed American citizens from Russia. He also repeatedly attacked Georgia’s very popular, very Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for not being sufficiently loyal. Despite their contentious past, and Kemp not supporting Trump in the primary, the governor was reportedly open to campaigning with the former president this fall. However, after Trump’s latest comments, that’s unlikely to happen. Like I said, he’s twisting himself into a strange pretzel. Earlier on Saturday, before sending his congratulations to a dictator and bashing a popular member of his own party, Trump made another self-sabotaging move — pulling out of a debate he already agreed to participate in.  Trump now says he won't attend the scheduled audience-less ABC News debate on Sept. 10. Instead, he proposed a debate on Fox News a week earlier with a full arena audience. Let’s pause on that for a moment: Trump’s saying he will not participate in a debate he already agreed to unless it turns into a MAGA rally with Fox moderators. Got it. Harris quickly called out the former president: “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space.’” As someone who’s worked on campaigns, I can tell you exactly what this is — this is what it looks like when one candidate has momentum and the other has no idea what to do about it. Here’s the thing: Harris will continue to own the spotlight for a while here. Her vice presidential pick is coming, she’ll hold rallies with her running mate all across battleground states next week, and a couple of weeks later, we’ll have the Democratic National Convention. And Trump is going to hate every second of that because he loves attention. As a result, he will get more and more outrageous and unhinged. That means we’re likely to see even more ugly, racist attacks like the one we saw from Trump in Chicago when he questioned the vice president’s racial identity.  But there is good news: Harris seems ready to respond to these attacks.  She told a crowd in Houston that Trump’s comments were just more of “the same old show,” and said the American people “deserve better.” “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us — they are an essential source of our strength,” Harris went on. That’s sort of the perfect response to all of this — to the racist attacks, to the unhinged rallies, to the games over debates: It’s the same old stuff, and America deserves better. Harris doesn’t make it about her. She makes it about the people they are running to represent. Not a bad message if you ask me.  Join Jen Psaki, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

I've run for public office. Kamala Harris is exactly the kind of candidate voters want.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-attacks-future-legacy-rcna165207,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""The Beat."" It’s hard for me not to get emotional about Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy. The American people are just starting to notice what an incredible, experienced and exciting leader she is. But for those of us who’ve followed her long career, that’s the Kamala Harris we’ve always known.  During her time as vice president, she has always been loyal to President Joe Biden. Even in the midst of all the panic over what was going to happen to the future of the Democratic Party and what was going to happen in this election cycle, she stayed loyal. However, as soon as Biden made his decision to leave the race and endorse his vice president, America finally had the chance to see the real Kamala Harris. For those of us who have had the privilege of seeking public office and asking for people’s trust, we know what voters want in return. They want to get to know you. They don’t want a presentation of what you think they may want — they want to know the real you. And that’s what Harris has shown to the American people. When she entered this race she came out as her full self. She came out powerfully and the people felt it. However, that doesn’t mean it’s been an easy few weeks for her. Harris has faced baseless attacks over her racial identity and qualifications.  This is someone who was a district attorney for a major city. Someone who was elected to a statewide office in California — the most populous state in the country. Someone who was elected to the U.S. Senate. And someone who is currently in the White House. There should be no debate over her qualifications. Her record speaks for itself. But these attacks against Harris are just an example of what we have to deal with — as Black women, as women of color, as women of any race — whenever we stand up and say, I can do this. Instead of having an honest discussion about ideas or qualifications, it devolves into personal attacks. And Harris has handled these baseless attacks masterfully. She’s been able to define herself without talking about herself. She's differentiated herself from Trump without calling him names. She's illustrated what kind of leader she is and will be if elected president. She's pointed at the future and told the American public this is what they deserve."

"In Kamala Harris’ California, ‘weird’ is the ultimate insult",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 2:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/weird-harris-trump-california-slang-rcna165232,"There’s been a lot of talk lately about Kamala Harris’ campaign’s effective use of the word “weird” to define Donald Trump and the Republican Party. It seems obvious to me this has gotten under the skin of both Trump and his running mate. Nonetheless, some people think it misses the mark. I think actor Wendell Pierce, for example, made a great argument that Democrats ought to call out right-wing racism and misogyny for what they are, rather than use a term that’s far more mild in comparison. Indeed, for someone with Trump’s history, “weird” can seem like a serious understatement. But at the same time, I’m a millennial raised on the West Coast and I know that the term has a slightly different connotation than some may associate with it, which I think speaks to its effectiveness. In Harris’ home state of California, for example, “weird” — for many young nonwhite people — doesn’t just mean quirky or unique, it’s used as an insult. That’s why there’s a genre of TikToks featuring young Californians talking about how being called “weird” — or its variant, “a weirdo” — is an offense that basically amounts to fighting words. Cali-based rapper YG’s song “Weird” explains — more crassly — the resonance the term has, while fellow California rapper Kendrick Lamar has used “weird” and “weirdo” on some of his diss tracks aimed at Drake, such as “Meet the Grahams” and “Not Like Us.” So, despite some understandable critique from fellow liberals, Harris and her campaign have settled on a term that appears to have cross-generational and cross-geographical appeal. “Weird” is a simple, straightforward term that voters of all ages can use, as my MSNBC colleague Ryan Teague Beckwith wrote, to describe Republicans whose “echo chambers and gerrymandered House districts” have led to ideas that are “increasingly extreme.” At the same time, the term is a familiar one to young voters of color — a constituency Harris will need to win in November."
College pics of Kamala Harris help highlight her Black Greek history,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 2:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-alpha-kappa-alpha-sorority-howard-rcna164185,"The mobilizing power of Black sororities has been in focus ever since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign last month. Harris, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. since her days at Howard University, has received rousing receptions at two major events for Black sororities in recent weeks, including the biennial convention for Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. and Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc.'s 60th biennial Boule. Any time Harris has pulled up to these events, her fellow Divine Nine sisters showed the palpable energy they — and Black Greeks broadly — stand to bring her campaign. For those familiar with Black Greek-letter organizations, there was never any question that members of these groups — which love to tout their esteemed legacies and pride themselves on their links to Black history — would broadly coalesce around Harris, as they did in 2020. I've noted several Black Greeks were speakers on the Win With Black Men organizing call for Harris last month. That call, which helped disprove a social media narrative about Black men being averse to voting for Harris, came on the heels of the previous night’s Win With Black Women call, which similarly featured multiple speakers from Black sororities. Both calls showed how Black Greeks and their networks can help mobilize Black folks around important political matters. And the possibility of electing the first AKA president — the first Black Greek president — is, as members of the org might say, a serious matter.   Late last month on “The ReidOut,” Joy Reid spoke with two of Harris’ line sisters (that is, women who pledged at the same time she did). After the clip aired, several viewers said they'd hoped to see some pics of the VP from her days on campus — or “on the yard,” as it’s often said. We'd included fairly recent photos of the VP and her line sisters in the segment, but we’re happy to share some throwbacks now that we have them! Check them out!

Donald Trump is out of control,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/donald-trump-kamala-harris-rally-georgia-rcna165244,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 5 episode of “Morning Joe.” During a campaign rally in Atlanta on Saturday, Donald Trump reignited one of his favorite old feuds. The former president spent roughly 10 minutes of his time on stage attacking Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, calling him “disloyal” and a “bad guy.” Trump told the crowd he blamed the governor for his criminal charges in the state, claiming Kemp could have shut down Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ investigation with a “phone call.” Now, attacking a popular sitting governor in his own state — a state you almost certainly will need to take back the White House — isn’t exactly a successful campaign strategy. And the only thing the former president succeeded in doing on Saturday was bringing even more negative attention to himself.  Trump clearly sees the enthusiasm surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. He knows enthusiasm comes first, then comes the uptick in the polling — which we’re already starting to see. If momentum continues to build for Harris, Trump knows where this is heading in November. What we saw Saturday was Trump responding to a chain of events that’s starting to feel out of his control.  Right now, he's grasping for anything. Trump's getting nastier, angrier and less disciplined. Every modicum of self-control he summoned during that weeklong period after the assassination attempt on him seems to be gone — like it's evaporated. "

That state wanted to sue the state of New York and block the former president’s gag order and upcoming sentencing following his guilty verdicts on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The high court denied Missouri’s motion Monday without explanation, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito noted in the order that they would have let the state file its complaint. While the two justices have recently sided with Trump, they have also previously signaled their disagreement with colleagues over the broader procedural issue of hearing lawsuits between states, indicating that they think the court must take such cases. This sort of case is different from the typical appeal at the Supreme Court, instead falling under the court’s “original” jurisdiction for suits between states. “New York’s prosecution of the presumptive Republican nominee is a transparent attempt to prevent the candidate disfavored by New York from freely campaigning,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, wrote to the justices last month, adding that it “threatens both the sovereign rights of Missouri and the constitutional rights of millions of its citizens.” New York Attorney General Letitia James opposed Missouri’s action, writing to the justices that “Missouri’s suit is based entirely on an ongoing criminal case between the Manhattan DA and former President Trump and does not present an actual controversy between sovereign States.” Trump is due to be sentenced in New York next month, but not before Judge Juan Merchan decides how, if at all, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling affects Trump’s state guilty verdicts. Merchan is expected to rule on the immunity issue Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects Trump’s immunity motion. The GOP presidential nominee also recently lost a New York state court appeal challenging his gag order ahead of sentencing.

"In Arizona’s fake electors case, Jenna Ellis agrees to cooperate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizonas-fake-elector-case-jenna-ellis-agrees-cooperate-rcna165256,"Last fall, Kris Mayes, Arizona’s Democratic state attorney general, told CNN that her office was overseeing a “robust” investigation related to Republicans’ fake electors scheme after the 2020 presidential election. We learned months later that she was quite sincere about this: An Arizona grand jury indicted 18 people in April — 11 fake electors and seven Donald Trump aides. There were some high-profile names among those charged, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis. On Monday, one of them flipped. NBC News reported: The good news for Ellis is that she’s no longer facing nine felony charges, and she no longer has to worry about ending up behind bars. The good news for prosecutors is that they now have a cooperating witness with key insights to share about the underlying electoral scheme. If these circumstances sound at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. In fact, it was last fall when Ellis pleaded guilty in Georgia to aiding and abetting false statements. The lawyer expressed what she described as “deep remorse” for her wrongdoing, adding that she shouldn’t have represented the former president in the case at all. As part of her agreement, the former Team Trump lawyer agreed to, among other things, provide evidence to prosecutors in Georgia — and as it turned out, she had information to share. It stands to reason that prosecutors in Arizona hope to benefit from a similar arrangement. There are legal experts who can speak to this with more authority than I can, but recent history suggests that after one defendant flips, others often follow. With this in mind, Ellis might be the first person to flip in the Arizona case, but there’s no reason to assume she’ll be the last. As for Ellis’ broader trajectory, the attorney has followed an unusual path. It might seem like ancient history, but in the 2016 campaign, she was not a Trump fan. As regular readers might recall, the Republican lawyer repeatedly described the then-candidate as an “idiot,” adding that she considered him “unethical, corrupt, lying, criminal, dirtbag.” Ellis even took aim at Trump’s supporters, saying they didn’t care about “facts or logic.” She later changed her mind. In fact, despite her rhetorical record, Ellis actually joined Trump’s legal team, becoming a rather enthusiastic proponent, not only of her client’s lies about his 2020 defeat, but also of radical tactics that would have allowed the then-president to remain in office despite the election results. Last year, she came full circle, declaring, “I simply can’t support him for elected office again.” Ellis added, “Why I have chosen to distance is because of that frankly malignant narcissistic tendency to simply say that he’s never done anything wrong.” If Trump starts going after Ellis by way of his social media platform, at least we’ll know why. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Elon Musk-backed PAC is facing an investigation in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:16 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-america-pac-michigan-investigation-rcna165186,"Michigan’s secretary of state is investigating a super PAC backed by Elon Musk over the group’s acquisition of voter information. CNBC reported Friday that America PAC, which Musk has said he created and helped fund amid his open support for Donald Trump, created a website ostensibly meant for voter registration — but it acts differently depending on who uses it. As CNBC reported: CNBC aptly noted that this meant people in battleground states who visited the site “got no help at all” with voter registration, but “they did hand over priceless personal data to a political operation” — data that someone like Musk, who owns a social media platform rife with right-wing disinformation, could easily use to microtarget voters with ads in the lead-up to November. On that note, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office said the state agency is reviewing Musk’s PAC out of concern for how the voter data is being used.  Per CNBC:  The result of the Michigan investigation may show that America PAC is operating completely within state law. Even so, that wouldn’t preclude how its website behaves from being unethical or downright eerie. CNBC reported that a person with direct knowledge of the PAC’s operations says that the group is planning to launch a new website soon. (CNBC said an America PAC spokesperson declined to comment and that Musk did not return emails seeking comment.) CNBC’s report serves as a timely reminder to be wary of “broligarchs,” a term that has emerged for rich white men in tech — like Musk — who desperately want to elect Trump and reap personal gains from the access they seem to feel will come as a result."

The fact that the underlying issue is several years old doesn’t come as too big of a surprise: I first started writing about Crow and his generosity toward Thomas more than 13 years ago. But that doesn’t make the apparent revelation any less notable: The Senate Finance Committee appears to have evidence of another instance in which a sitting Supreme Court justice took flights on a Republican megadonor private plane and failed to disclose. In a detailed letter to Thomas’ attorney, Wyden, who chairs the Finance Committee, wrote, “I am deeply concerned that Mr. Crow may have been showering a public official with extravagant gifts, then writing off those gifts to lower his tax bill. This concern is only heightened by the Committee’s recent discovery of additional undisclosed international travel on Mr. Crow’s private jet by Justice Thomas. “As I consider legislative solutions to curb potentially abusive deductions, I am offering you one final opportunity to address the tax treatment of yacht and jet trips involving Justice Thomas.” For those who might benefit from a refresher, let’s circle back to our earlier coverage and review how we arrived at this point. Thomas has faced difficult ethics questions for many years, but his difficulties took a more serious turn last spring. ProPublica published a rather devastating report in early April of last year, shining a light on the generous and undisclosed benefits Thomas has received from a Republican megadonor. In the weeks and months that followed, ProPublica took the lead on exposing Thomas’ other unusual ties to his wealthy friend, but the outlet wasn’t alone. The New York Times also took the story further, shining a light on previously unreported benefits the justice has received from a “cohort of wealthy and powerful friends,” thanks to his connections established through the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. The Times added fresh reporting last summer on one of Thomas’ other wealthy pals providing the sitting justice with undisclosed financing that made it possible for Thomas to buy an expensive recreational vehicle. How big was the loan? Neither the justice nor his friend say. How much did Thomas repay? They wouldn’t say. What were the terms of the loan? They wouldn’t say. Was there a formal loan agreement? They wouldn’t say. Soon after, ProPublica published another report that made the entire controversy look considerably worse, noting that Thomas had received “at least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” In each instance, the far-right jurist’s luxurious benefits “have been underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence.” Though the precise value of the trips is difficult to measure, ProPublica described it as “likely in the millions” of dollars. It’s an impossible dynamic to defend: Thomas has lived the life of a wealthy man, thanks to the generosity of his rich, likeminded friends. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, “There is nothing partisan about calling this what it is: a brazen, shameful abuse of power that undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. That Thomas reportedly took these gifts is alarming enough. That he reportedly took them without disclosing that he had taken them (with rare exceptions) makes it hard to believe that Thomas doesn’t realize how bad this all looks.” Earlier this year it reached the point at which Thomas became a punch-line to jokes about Supreme Court corruption. (In February, The Onion, a satirical outlet, published a memorable item with a headline that read, “Clarence Thomas Announces 50% Discount On All Favorable Rulings.”) Last month, at least two senators asked the Justice Department to take matters to the next level with the appointment of a special counsel. Last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a package of reform measures, including a call for a binding code of conduct for the high court, with ethics rules that require justices to, among other things, disclose gifts. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The problem with Gorsuch's court reform warning to 'be careful',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 11:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/gorsuch-supreme-court-reforms-rcna165152,"In an interview with “Fox News Sunday” to promote his new book, Justice Neil Gorsuch offered some advice when asked about President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court reform proposals: “Be careful.” Caution is prudent — judicious, even — but the context surrounding Gorsuch’s remarks is worth exploring. In a clip of the interview, which aired in part on Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked the justice about Biden’s proposals, including term limits and an enforceable ethics code. Gorsuch demurred at first, noting that it’s a political issue in a presidential election year. Then he continued, “I have one thought to add”: So, what are we to make of Gorsuch’s thought? On the one hand, it’s cliched enough that it’s almost difficult to disagree with at a certain level of generality. Yes, people’s rights should be protected no matter who they are. Judges should be independent in all circumstances. It’s not entirely clear what juries have to do with this subject, but they’re an important part of our system, too. Yet, to the extent that the concern is that court reform threatens judicial independence: How is that, exactly? It’s unclear how term limits, for example, would make judges less independent, as opposed to them simply serving for shorter, predetermined amounts of time. The status quo, meanwhile, is a chaotic, inherently politicized one in which justices seek to time their retirements so that a president from the political party that appointed them can nominate their replacement. Perhaps that’s independence in the sense that it’s what a given justice wants, but it’s difficult to see how that leads to greater fairness for the people bound by the high court’s rulings. Judges are cautious creatures. And any powerful official, Supreme Court justices included, won’t relinquish power easily, whether by way of being checked by a co-equal branch of government or otherwise. But if caution is warranted in altering the status quo, then it’s warranted in maintaining it, too.

I'm Black and Asian. Trump's attack on Kamala Harris was an attack on me.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 10:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-attack-kamala-harris-nabj-racist-xenophobia-rcna164871,"As a woman of color who has spent my whole life fighting bigotry, I didn’t think I could be more offended by the candidate running for president at the top of the Republican ticket. But then, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) made former President Donald Trump sit on a stage with three Black women journalists, where he illustrated the full extent of his racist xenophobia. Trump made many offensive remarks in that appearance Wednesday in Chicago; chief among the triggers for me was the way he questioned the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has now enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination and is soon expected to officially become the first Black woman and the first Indian woman to head a major party’s ticket. Trump said, “She was … of Indian heritage…until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He then asked ""Is she Indian or is she Black?” It’s incredible that in 2024, he asked that question — as if she couldn’t possibly be both. Harris’ background is well documented. Her father is a Black Jamaican. Her mother was Indian. Thirty-eight years ago, she graduated from Howard University, an HBCU, where she pledged the country’s oldest Black sorority. Trump remains trapped in the era in America in which people were expected to have a single racial identity. And, to be clear, that time was not so long ago. As recently as 1997, I left Jamaica as a woman of both Black and Asian heritage. I knew myself, without controversy, to be biracial. Then I arrived in the United States, where I was only Black. Suddenly, I found myself explaining my Chinese surname to white people who questioned me about it. If the conversation went further, then I had to make the case for identifying as both Black and Chinese. This reality was starkly different from my experience back home, where my Asian heritage was not in opposition to my Black heritage. In post-colonial Black Jamaica, being mixed carried some measure of privilege — it also came with some derision, but never, ever, denial. Everyone there accepted me as Black and Asian. In the United States, I was expected to be Black or Asian.  In a 2019 interview on “The Breakfast Club,” Harris said it herself: “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. I was born Black, I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.”  Trump has seized upon a video of her in the kitchen with the Indian American actress Mindy Kaling in which Harris enthusiastically affirms Kaling’s description of her as Indian and tells the actress, “You look like the entire one half of my family.” Kaling says, “I’ve been telling people we’re related already. This is perfect.” In a social media post, Trump says Harris “is saying she’s Indian, not Black. This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” Trump seeks to take the power of belonging to both Black and Indian cultures from Harris. He attempts to delegitimize her by insisting that belonging to both makes her some sort of traitor, somehow deviant, freakish, abnormal. Trump is tapping into a disturbingly pervasive American belief in a racial binary, that you’ve got to be one thing or another. Black folks all over the world know our community is of mixed-racial heritage. We understand that the one-drop rule, which says that anybody with one drop of Black blood is Black, is, at its core, reductive. That rule was meant to exclude Black people from the privileges afforded only to those possessing the visible quality of whiteness; being of mixed race often denied you a white heritage, but your Black racial identity was never contested. It was always yours to keep, perhaps because no one inside the racist patriarchy could imagine anyone else wanting it. But in the present political climate where the percentage of white voters is shrinking — Harris being doubly of color makes Trump nervous. That she could excite Black voters to the extent that they were excited when Barack Obama ran for president is making the party of white nationalism nervous. That she could consolidate the Indian American vote makes her a double threat. That she could inspire women to turn out this November makes her a virtual atomic bomb to the GOP. Historically, people of color had to be whatever white people said we were. Now that they’re afraid that being a person of color may provide some limited benefit, they wish to intimate that race is something mutable, subject to flights of fancy. It is terrifyingly revealing, that the practice of racial exclusivity, which Black people had nothing to do with, is being refashioned into a weapon against Harris in the moment when her blackness could be of some benefit to her and the community that supports her bid for the presidency.  James Baldwin, who was born 100 years ago this month, said it best, “We can disagree and still love each other, unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.” Trump’s comments deny the humanity of biracial people and challenges our right to exist. He bugles a call being taken up by many who follow his lead. The day Biden endorsed Harris for president, I posted on Instagram, “OMG!!! We got a Black Woman in the US presidential election!” In no time, there were more than 500 comments from the MAGA camp denying Harris’ Blackness, berating her as the unqualified DEI hire and accusing me of being racist. Multiple people reported the post as offensive. Some directly messaged me to ask how I would feel if they had posted about a white man running for president. When my answer did not suffice, I was dismissed as a “dumb coconut” who didn’t deserve to vote because I didn’t have the good sense to see through a candidate who was pretending to be Black to get my vote. Pretending to be Black. Unless they look white and are trying hard to pass, nobody’s Blackness in America is invisible. To suggest that Blackness is a cloak that Harris can put on and remove at will is to discredit the experience of millions of voting Americans who navigate the pitfalls of racial oppression daily. What his off-the-rails performance at the NABJ convention illustrates is Trump’s inability to come to terms with the changing face of the Unites States of America. Trump, the MAGA candidate, longs for the good old days when he could, at least before he got sued by the Justice Department, bar Black people from renting his properties. He is angry at a world that dares to proffer a Black woman, an Indian woman, as a serious contender for president. He does not wish to live in this new, emerging America. That’s one of many reasons he should not be elected to lead it."
Half of Trump’s former Cabinet secretaries haven’t backed his 2024 bid,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 10:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/half-trumps-former-cabinet-secretaries-havent-backed-2024-election-rcna165185,"Imagine you were an employer looking to hire someone for your workplace team. You’ve collected some résumé, but to help make a decision, you decide it’s best to check with applicants’ references. After all, to get a sense of how someone would perform on the job, it makes sense to ask those who’ve worked with him/her in the recent past. Then imagine you reach out to an applicant’s former colleagues, and when you ask whether they’d extend their support, nearly half of them hesitate. In fact, some are quite explicit in warning you not to hire the applicant. Would you hire the person anyway? Keep the question in mind when reading the latest Washington Post report on Donald Trump’s former Cabinet officials: By the Post’s count, 42 people, at some point between January 2017 and January 2021, served in Trump’s Cabinet. Based on the latest tally, 24 of them — roughly 57% — are publicly supporting their former boss’s ongoing candidacy. The rest either won’t take a position or have declared publicly that they won’t support the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee. It’s worth emphasizing that the Post’s assessment is rather generous to the former president: Former White House chief of staff John Kelly, for example, has been brutal in his condemnations of Trump, but the newspaper’s official tally lists the retired general as not having taken a firm stand on the former president’s re-election bid. Nevertheless, this is an exceedingly tough dynamic for Republicans to defend. Indeed, one of the reasons I’ve been preoccupied with this angle for quite a while is because it simply has never happened before: Presidents have been known to clash from time to time with individual members of their administrations, but Trump is unique in facing so much opposition from his own team. As ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos recently summarized during an appearance on MSNBC, “His secretary of state called him a ‘moron.’ [Former Defense Secretary James] Mattis says he doesn’t even respect the Constitution. John Kelly says he’s the worst person he ever met. Think about that applying to any other president of the United States at any other time. “Their chief of staff, their defense secretary, their secretary of state, their national security adviser are the ones who had the most damning judgments of his competence and character. That is chilling.” In June, President Joe Biden was equally eager to draw attention to this. “Take it from the people who know Donald Trump best — he is unfit to be president,” the Democratic incumbent concluded. As we discussed last year, members of a White House cabinet have a unique perspective on an American presidency. After a president chooses them for their powerful positions, these cabinet officials routinely work closely with the person behind the desk in the Oval Office, learning first-hand how a president thinks, works, prioritizes, processes information, and leads. I’ve long wondered what might persuade voters inclined to support Trump to change their minds. Who, if anyone, will they listen to? Clearly, these voters will not be persuaded by pundits. Or lawmakers. Or historians. Or prosecutors. Or committee reports. Or special counsel investigations. But perhaps they’ll consider listening to those who worked closely with Trump, and who are now keeping their distance as he tries to regain power. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

"On the politics of electric vehicles, Trump says the quiet part loud",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/politics-electric-vehicles-trump-says-quiet-part-loud-elon-musk-2024-rcna165166,"Donald Trump has been unsubtle in his condemnations of electric vehicles. After taking steps to stymie the industry during his presidency, the Republican added EVs to his party’s list of culture war villains after leaving the White House. Last fall, for example, Trump told an audience that people who own electric cars become “somewhat schizophrenic“ because they can only drive their cars for 10 minutes. Around the same time, he insisted that gas-powered cars are better for the environment than EVs. (They’re not.) In December, the GOP candidate added that electric vehicles don’t “go far” and have to be recharged “every two minutes.” As recently as June, a Washington Post report noted that the Republican nominee “has made bashing EVs a cornerstone of his campaign.” And yet, there’s been an unmistakable shift of late in the former president’s posture. As a recent New York Times report summarized: At an event in Michigan two weeks ago, for example, the Republican said, “I’m constantly talking about electric vehicles but I don’t mean I’m against them. I’m totally for them.” He added that he’s driven EVs “and they are incredible.”Saturday night in Atlanta, Trump went even further, and said the quiet part loud. “I’m for electric cars,” the former president said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. “I have to be, you know, because [Tesla’s Elon Musk] endorsed me very strongly. So, I have no choice.” I’m reminded anew of a recent Politico report with a memorable headline: “Trump keeps flip-flopping his policy positions after meeting with rich people.” As we discussed last week, the list of such incidents keeps growing. It includes TikTok, Anheuser-Busch and the cryptocurrency industry, but Trump’s newfound praise for electric vehicles — he has “no choice” because of Musk — is perhaps the most extraordinary because of the time and effort he invested into telling American consumers not to buy EVs. That is, until he decided they’re “incredible.” Trump pointed to Musk’s endorsement, but it might not be the only consideration. The New York Times recently reported that Musk was “likely” to offer “significant” support for a new pro-Trump super PAC created by Musk’s closest friends. The Wall Street Journal had a related report, noting that the conspiratorial billionaire is prepared to spend “around $45 million a month” in the hopes of putting the Republican back in power. Musk later denied the accuracy of the reporting, though Trump personally suggested that Musk is, in fact, investing $45 million a month in support of his candidacy. The Republican added soon after that he intends to “make life good” for Musk and people like him in a prospective second term. For his part, CNBC reported late last week that the conspiratorial billionaire and his allies are “collecting data in more than a half-dozen swing states” in the hopes of giving Trump a boost. An NBC News report added that a Musk-backed political action committee “has been acquiring detailed voter information from those living in Michigan and other battleground states after people submit their personal data through a section on the PAC’s website that says ‘register to vote.’” The tactics are now under investigation from the Michigan secretary of state’s office and North Carolina's state attorney general's office.

Judge Chutkan already busy on Trump docket after immunity delay,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-chutkan-trump-election-interference-case-rcna165135,"U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is attempting to move Donald Trump’s federal election interference case forward after it returned to her docket Friday. Over the weekend, she denied the former president’s motion to dismiss the case based on “selective and vindictive prosecution” and set a court date for next week. The Obama appointee issued an order on Saturday setting a conference to discuss the case on Aug. 16 (she said Trump doesn’t have to attend). Ahead of that date, she ordered the prosecution and the defense, by Friday, Aug. 9, to “confer and file a status report that proposes, jointly to the extent possible, a schedule for pretrial proceedings moving forward.” Of course, the main event to come is for Chutkan to apply the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling to Trump’s case, to see what’s left of it after the high court announced a new test that at least limits prosecutions against former presidents. To what extent the ruling ultimately curbs special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump remains to be seen. We should get a sense of how the parties want that litigation to proceed by how they lay out their respective positions to Chutkan in the status report this week, after which the judge will decide what happens next in connection with the Aug. 16 conference. The litigation is set against the backdrop of the looming presidential election, whose outcome could determine whether the case continues at all, because Trump will likely get rid of it if he regains the power to do so. Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of Trump’s other federal case, over alleged unlawful retention of classified documents and obstruction, though that appeal won’t likely be fully resolved before the election. As for Trump’s other two criminal cases, the Georgia case is tied up on a pretrial appeal and the New York case is set for sentencing in September unless it’s derailed by immunity-related litigation. (Remember: Presidents can’t dismiss or pardon state charges.) Also on Saturday, Chutkan rejected one of Trump’s claims that doesn’t turn on immunity: that he was selectively and vindictively prosecuted. At the outset, Chutkan took Trump’s lawyers to task for their “improper reframing of the allegations.” She corrected his “alternate narrative” that he was charged for merely disputing the outcome of an election and working with others to propose alternate electors. Rather, the judge noted that he’s charged “with knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.” Chutkan then rejected Trump’s argument that President Joe Biden and the special counsel launched the prosecution to prevent him from retaking the White House. “Finding no evidence of discriminatory purpose in the sources Defendant cites, the court is left only with his unsupported assertions that this prosecution must be politically motivated because it coexists with his campaign for the Presidency,” the judge wrote. Rejecting his vindictive prosecution claim — that he was only charged after he publicly criticized the 2020 election and certain government officials — Chutkan wrote that Trump “has presented no evidence demonstrating a likelihood of vindictiveness.” That long-shot motion wasn’t expected to succeed, and its denial shows Chutkan clearing the decks ahead of a possible trial. Still, whether and when such a trial will happen is unclear. That will partly turn on the outcome of the forthcoming immunity litigation and, perhaps more immediately, November's election. As ever, his best legal defense is becoming president again. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Why Trump’s offensive against Georgia’s Republican governor matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 7:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-offensive-georgias-republican-governor-brian-kemp-2024-election-rcna165156,"About a week ago, Sen. JD Vance appeared on Fox News and assured the public that Donald Trump is not a “vengeful guy.” By all appearances, the Ohio Republican wasn’t kidding — though the comment was unintentionally hilarious to those of us familiar with the former president’s record. Six days after Vance’s on-air declaration, Trump proved his hapless running mate wrong in spectacular fashion. The Associated Press reported: The new offensive against Brian Kemp, Georgia’s incumbent GOP governor, began in earnest on Saturday afternoon, when Trump posted an odd screed to his social media platform. To hear the former president tell it, the governor only won the office because of Trump’s support, and years later, the former president is blaming Kemp for his state’s crime rates and underwhelming economy. The missive went on to call the conservative governor a “bad guy,” who could’ve derailed Trump’s criminal prosecution in the state “with a phone call.” Hours later, the GOP presidential nominee kept going. As a Washington Post report summarized, “Trump mocked him sarcastically and called him ‘Little Brian’; repeatedly called him ‘disloyal’; blamed Kemp for Trump being charged in Georgia by a prosecutor whom Kemp has criticized; suggested Kemp wanted Republicans to lose elections; and argued Georgia would have better crime and economic numbers if Kemp were no longer governor.” That’s really just a sampling. Trump also targeted the governor’s wife and goaded his followers into booing their own home state’s Republican governor. It’d probably be an overstatement to say the 2024 candidate attacked Kemp more than Vice President Kamala Harris, but it was close. Perhaps most importantly, though, the former president singled out the Georgia governor for failing to commit election fraud to benefit him in 2020. It was only natural to wonder why in the world the Republican Party’s presidential nominee would repeatedly attack a GOP governor, in his own competitive state, with three months remaining before Election Day. Indeed, Georgia Republicans were apparently baffled by Trump’s offensive. But the man the public saw on the stage in Atlanta was a familiar figure: Kemp didn’t help Trump cheat four years ago, and he did little to boost his primary candidacy four months ago, so the former president felt justified in throwing a tantrum — indifferent to electoral and/or strategic considerations. For Democrats, the spectacle was notable, not just because of the inherent value in seeing Trump invest so much energy into attacking an ostensible ally, but also because of the larger messaging. The night President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign, someone who works in Democratic politics sent me a text that said a Harris-Trump match-up would be “the future vs the past.” The Republican nominee would be on the ballot for the third consecutive cycle, the argument went, while the Democratic nominee would offer voters something new and exciting, despite being an incumbent vice president. The point was obvious: In a contest between stale and fresh, bet on the latter. It was against this backdrop that Trump went to Atlanta, lied about his 2020 defeat (again), lashed out at local officials (again), targeted an intraparty foe’s spouse (again), recycled derisive nicknames (again), and even congratulated Russia’s Vladimir Putin (again). It’s as if Trump heard about “the future vs the past” framing and decided to help prove the point."
"As Trump backs out of debate with Harris, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 6:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-backs-debate-kamala-harris-what-now-election-2024-rcna165138,"In his imagination, Donald Trump is a man of incredible bravery. In 2018, for example, after a gunman killed 17 people in a Florida high school, the Republican boasted that he would’ve had the courage to run into the school during the mass shooting. In remarks to the nation’s governors, the then-president said at the time, “I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” It was a difficult line to take seriously, but it was a peek into a weird perspective: In Trump’s mind, he’s effectively an action star. People were supposed to believe the septuagenarian president would’ve voluntarily run into an ongoing deadly crisis, where he’d confront a teen armed with an assault rifle, carrying with him nothing but his wits and his bare hands. Trump’s reality, of course, is far different. The former president is better known for promising to take the stand in court cases, only to back down with the pressure on. He’s also the candidate who thought it’d be a good idea to agree to a presidential debate in September, only to ditch the idea when Democrats rallied behind a candidate that scares him. NBC News reported: There were some headlines over the weekend about Trump “agreeing” to debate Harris, but that’s not quite what happened. Rather, what Trump decided to do was back out of a debate he and his team had previously agreed to, while simultaneously proposing a different event, the details of which he prefers. The Republican originally said he’d appear at a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News, without an audience. The GOP nominee has abandoned that commitment, instead saying he’s prepared to appear at a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News, “with a full arena audience.” It’s not altogether clear whether Trump ran this by Fox News — the network had pitched the idea of hosting a possible event on Sept. 17 — though it’s also possible that the former president is working from the assumption that Fox will simply follow his directions. For Harris, all of this is apparently absurd: The incumbent vice president has said she’ll stick to the plan that Team Trump originally agreed to, and she’s asking the former president to honor his commitment. That, evidently, isn’t likely to happen. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping, Trump posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” None of this comes as too big of a surprise. Almost immediately after Biden ended his re-election campaign, the GOP nominee started backing away from a possible debate. On Friday morning, before formally ditching the existing plan, Trump told Fox Business, “I mean, right now I say, why should I do a debate?” At some level, the former president probably realizes this makes him look like a coward, but in the electoral calculus, he’s apparently concluded that it’s better to look weak than show up on a debate stage and look worse. So where does this leave us? While presidential debates have become a common staple in recent decades, in the not-too-distant past, such events were rarities. In the 1964, 1968 and 1972 election cycles, for example, Americans did not see the major-party nominees share a stage. Unless Trump musters the courage to change his mind, 2024 will be a throwback to that bygone era."

Gov. Geoff Duncan threw his support behind the Democrat fairly quickly, and John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona’s third-largest city, endorsed her soon after. Given the state of the cotemporary GOP, it’s not easy for any Democratic candidate to pick up cross-party backing, so this represented a decent start. But hanging overhead was an obvious question: Would other Republicans soon follow? The question received a rather emphatic answer over the weekend. NBC News reported: Those names are, of course, just a sampling. According to a press statement from the incumbent vice president’s campaign, Republicans for Harris includes endorsements from former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye; former Secretaries Chuck Hagel and Ray LaHood; former Governors Jim Edgar, Bill Weld, and Christine Todd Whitman; former U.S. House members Rod Chandler, Tom Coleman, Dave Emery, Wayne Gilchrest, Jim Greenwood, Adam Kinzinger, John LeBoutillier, Susan Molinari, Jack Quinn, Denver Riggleman, Claudine Schneider, Christopher Shays, Peter Smith, Alan Steelman, David Trott, and Joe Walsh; and former GOP State Chair and State Senator Chris Vance, among others. “As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,” Kinzinger said in a written statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House. Donald Trump poses a direct threat to fundamental American values. He only cares about himself, and his pursuit of power. “That’s what we saw on January 6 when he sent a mob to overturn our lawful election, who violently attacked law enforcement and ransacked our nation’s Capitol in the process,” the former member of the Jan. 6 committee added. “There’s too much at stake to sit on the sidelines, which is why I wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris for president. Now is the time for us all to unite to save our democracy and defeat Donald Trump one last time.” What’s more, the “Republicans for Harris” rollout is apparently about more than simply including names on a list. The Associated Press reported that the program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” using well-known Republicans “to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said.” The list might also yet grow: NBC News’ report noted that Team Harris is especially interested in targeting former Rep. Liz Cheney and former Sen. Jeff Flake. I kept a close eye on this dynamic four years ago and found quite a few GOP partisans — former Republican National Committee chairs, former Republican cabinet secretaries, former Republican governors, and former Republican members of Congress — who publicly expressed support for the Biden-led Democratic ticket. As Election Day 2024 approaches, Harris is well positioned to benefit from similar cross-party support — which Trump will almost certainly lack. Watch this space.

"With Putin, Trump ignores ‘do not congratulate’ advice (again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/putin-trump-ignores-not-congratulate-advice-rcna165128,"In the spring of 2018, relations between the United States and Russia were at a delicate stage. Vladimir Putin’s government had been credibly accused of launching a poison gas assassination attempt on British soil; the White House had just announced sanctions against Russia in response to its attack on our elections; and the Kremlin had just orchestrated a sham election that kept Putin in power. It was against that backdrop that Donald Trump was scheduled to have a telephone meeting with the Russian leader. The then-American president’s national security team prepared briefing materials, directing Trump to condemn the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. As for Putin’s re-election, the same U.S. officials wrote in all capital letters, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE.” It was a message the Republican couldn’t miss. It was, however, a message Trump was prepared to disregard. As regular readers might recall, the then-American president spoke to Putin, ignored his own team, made no mention of the poisoning, and congratulated Putin as if the Russian election had been legitimate. The incident was striking for a variety of reasons, and it made clear that when it comes to his autocratic allies abroad, the Republican likes to issue congratulatory declarations. More than six years later, Trump is still congratulating his benefactor in Moscow. The Washington Post reported: “I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal,” the GOP nominee told a rally audience in Atlanta on Saturday. He added, “We have 59 hostages; I never paid anything. ... Boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals. It’s nice to say we got ’em back, but does that set a bad precedent?” At issue was an incredibly complex diplomatic feat, negotiated between seven countries — some of which don’t get along especially well. Trump’s first instinct was to complain bitterly about the agreement that brought home four U.S. residents who’d been wrongly imprisoned in Russia. His second instinct was to publicly congratulate, not the officials from his own country who negotiated this historic deal, but the head of the adversarial country who improperly imprisoned the U.S. residents in the first place. As for the idea that Trump “never paid anything” to secure Americans’ release, the former president continues to lie about his record, and as the Post’s report added, he “authorized an agreement to pay $2 million to North Korea for medical bills in the release of Otto Warmbier.” Nevertheless, it’s Trump’s public praise for Putin — or more to the point, his latest public praise for Putin — that stands out. Indeed, his new congratulatory message comes on the heels of the Republican pointing to the Russian leader for validation to justify his position on Ukraine. Which came on the heels of the former American president celebrating the fact that Putin was echoing his talking points about the 2024 election and Trump’s multiple criminal indictments. Which came on the heels of Trump telling a Mar-a-Lago audience how “smart” Putin was for invading a neighboring country. Which came on the heels of Trump describing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as “genius” and part of a “wonderful” strategy. Which came on the heels of years’ worth of Trump kowtowing, genuflecting, and repeatedly showing abject weakness toward his Russian ally. U.S. intelligence officials have spent months alerting the public to the fact that the Russian government has launched a “whole-of-government” effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, hoping to return Trump to power. As recently as last week, NBC News reported, “The U.S. intelligence community believes the Kremlin will direct its propaganda efforts to support former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, an intelligence official indicated on a media call Monday.” Let no one wonder why. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why 'We're not going back' is such a powerful statement,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 4:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-delivers-only-response-need-trumps-regressive-messaging-rcna165102,"Less than a week ago, in Atlanta, Vice President Kamala Harris stood in front of 10,000 people; I was told another 10,000 awaited outside the venue, unable to get in. The crowd was jubilant, filled with the kind of hope many Democrats thought had slipped through their fingers this election cycle. Megan Thee Stallion played a compilation of G-rated versions of her songs. A powerful and commanding Harris told the crowd, “Donald Trump is feeling it.” The crowd went wild. She paused for a beat and delivered the coup de grâce: “We are not going back.” This is the first presidential election since the fall of Roe, since women in this country lost the constitutional right to privacy. That right, which we fought so hard to enshrine in the Constitution in 1973, is gone. This means that my daughter has fewer rights than my mother did.  This creates an unusual moment in American history. Namely, many people of color have lived through these kinds of rights reversals before — think of the fall of Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow laws in the South or the internment of Japanese people during World War II or the historical treatment of Native Americans. White women, on the other hand, have largely been protected by the system. In 2016, 46% of white women in America who voted voted for Trump. And their protection ended in 2022 when the conservative majority Supreme Court, enabled by Trump, overturned Roe. Those women, at least the ones who live in red states, now have fewer rights than they did in 2016. They went back.  I’ve written about Harris and the difficulties she faces being the first female vice president, the second Black female senator ever, the first South Asian American to serve in the Senate, the first female African American and first South Asian to be California attorney general. Harris has had to kick down more than a few doors and shatter some glass ceilings. (In fact, the X account RNC Research used a video of her talking about kicking down doors from an AAPI event in May. Presumably the account intended to criticize and embarrass Harris, but the clip hasn’t exactly had that effect.)  Harris achieved things that simply weren’t available to her mother. Her life and career have all been about going forward. On the other hand, Trump’s “Make America great again, again” campaign is all about going backward. And that’s what we should be focusing on this election. Harris’ Atlanta speech sparked a number of conversations with women in my own life. Delaware Senate candidate Lisa Blunt Rochester emailed me about the slogan, writing, “The word WE stands out. WE — the women, communities of color, families, seniors, LGBTQ+ folks, the people of this country — have come so far. Our victories were hard won and well deserved. From protecting the Affordable Care Act to investing in our climate to creating good jobs and so much more. We have come so far, yet there is so much more we can do together, including fighting for our reproductive freedoms and right to vote. Our progress won’t be stopped — and WE will make sure of that when we cast our ballots for Kamala Harris in November.” If Rochester wins her election, she will be only the fourth Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate and the first from Delaware, which means that she, too, will have had to kick down some doors. Former White House communications director and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign director Jennifer Palmieri texted me, “The best campaigns — the ones that really capture and inspire voters — don’t have slogans, they have battle cries that catch on organically. That’s what ‘We will not go back’ is. A sentiment the vice president expressed, that she represents and the crowd chanted back to her. Those are the slogans that get you in the gut.”  I think Palmieri’s idea of “We’re not going back” as a battle cry is salient. But it’s also more than that. Resisting going back is the only sane response to MAGA and its deeply regressive policies. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which Trump disavowed after poor polling but which was at one time thought of as the intellectual hub of Trumpism, would undo a lot of the federal government, including ending the Education Department, which would, at least at the federal level, actively take Americans back to a time when there was no social safety net, when Hoovervilles dotted the landscape.  Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a former civil rights lawyer, texted me, “We’ve been under an ugly orange cloud that defines greatness as a time prior to the civil rights & liberties of all being recognized in this country, so when the VP says we won’t go back, this is what I take her to mean. She wants to move this country forward with Freedom for ALL OF US & I’m with her.” Veteran campaign manager Stuart Stevens always tells me, “Campaigns are about the future.” And how better to message the future than to point out all the many ways Republicans want to take the country, and women’s rights specifically, back?  When Roe was overturned, we American women went back to a time when we didn’t have bodily autonomy, when we couldn’t get lifesaving treatment for ectopic pregnancies. Backward is the very core of this Republican Party right now: backward-facing, uninterested or unwilling to move on from a candidate who is very much stuck in the past. Trump wants America to go back to 2016 when it mistakenly made him president. Harris has given us the perfect response to that agenda. CORRECTION: (Aug. 5, 8:20 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Senate candidate Lisa Blunt Rochester’s state. It’s Delaware, not Maryland."
Transcript: Mystery Man,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 5, 2024, 1:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/transcript-mystery-man-rcna165108,"Transcript Rachel Maddow Present: Ultra Episode 8: Mystery Man With the backing of an eccentric billionaire and powerful voices on the American far-right, a high-stakes effort to make Sen. Joseph McCarthy president surfaces at the Republican convention, as the years-long manhunt for American fascist Francis Yockey finally reaches its strange and dramatic end. Francis Yockey and Joe McCarthy become martyr figures for an ascendant and aggressive ultra-right intent on reshaping American life and politics for decades to come.  Announcer: This episode contains descriptions that reference self-harm. If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or chat live at 988lifeline.org.  (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rachel Maddow: He was the richest man in America. Everyone was pretty sure of that, even if no one was exactly sure just how much money he had.  Narrator: Estimates of the value of this empire range $2.5 billion to $3 billion, figures difficult for ordinary mortals to comprehend. Maddow: He was a Texas oil man. And his oil holdings were huge, not just in Texas terms but on an international scale. “Texas Monthly” calculated that, during World War II, his holdings alone produced more oil than Germany, and Italy, and Japan, not the United States altogether, just his oil fields alone.  He was also what you might call eccentric.  Narrator: He has, it appears, only three abiding interests, making money, combating communism in his own way, and enjoying his large family. Maddow: You’ve heard stories about men who somehow found the time to have a second secret family, in addition to the one everyone knew about?  H.L. Hunt, this Texas oil man, he somehow had time to run the largest privately held oil empire in the Western world, and also to have a second secret family, and then also to have a third secret family on top of that.  H.L. Hunt had seven children with his first wife. When she died, he quickly remarried to a secretary from his company. She was raising four children who were supposedly from a previous marriage. But H.L. Hunt soon admitted those four were his children as well.  When he died, yet another woman came forward with four more kids, all of whom he had also fathered and supported in yet a third secret family. And who knows, maybe there were more someplace else. But there were at least those three families, two of them secret, and at least those 15 children.  His eldest child, a son, he had sent for a lobotomy for the destruction of part of his brain, a crippling so-called treatment for some poorly understood mental condition. H.L. Hunt himself had a fifth-grade education.  He was devoted to the idea that the best form of exercise, the only truly natural form of exercise, was crawling, crawling around on the floor like a baby, which he did every day, fully dressed in a shirt and tie, including on several occasions in front of reporters.  He called it creeping. He shouted to a Dallas Morning News reporter -- quote -- “I’m a crank about creeping.” H.L. Hunt believed that even Republican presidents, including Herbert Hoover and Dwight D. Eisenhower, were socialists, if not communists. After General Douglas MacArthur was fired during the Korean War for disobeying orders from the commander-in-chief, H.L. Hunt supported him, MacArthur, for President in 1952.  He was also becoming increasingly devoted to U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy. By then, H.L. Hunt had also started his own media empire.  Narrator: The dissemination of right-wing educational materials, as he calls them. Maddow: A low-profile, but fast-growing network of radio shows and TV shows and syndicated columns and newsletters.  Announcer: It’s “Facts Forum” time.  Maddow: At the launch of a H.L. Hunt TV program called “Facts Forum,” he hired a new staffer from the office of Senator Joe McCarthy, a young staffer who would soon become McCarthy’s wife. McCarthy himself was the first guest on the show. Announcer: A program designed and presented to interest you in a subject of vital national importance. Maddow: Reporters soon noticed that a majority of the programming on Hunt’s various broadcasts was dedicated to promoting McCarthy: plugging his speeches, bringing on other guests to say how great he was.  Narrator: Hunt spends millions each year in spreading his religious, super patriotic messages. He is a strong advocate of right-wing causes and is considered by some to be a serious threat to American institutions. Maddow: In politics, it is no small thing to have the support of the richest man in the country, even if he is a little eccentric, especially if that man controls media outlets that echo and reinforce and amplify his support.  But Joe McCarthy’s support wasn’t just from eccentric right-wing billionaires like H.L. Hunt.  Radio anchor: McCarthy will jump into the fray with a battle cry that the fight on communism must not be hindered, and he will have support. Maddow: In the lead-up to the 1956 presidential election, a group described as nationalists, including former Congressman Hamilton Fish, former Senator Burton Wheeler, Chicago Tribune publisher Robert McCormick, they all met at the Harvard Club in New York City to plot the next step up for Joe McCarthy. Congressman Fish emerged from that meeting to tell the press that McCarthy would achieve the presidency in 1956, even if he had to do it with an independent or a third-party bid.  By that time, McCormick’s group, For America, had been promoting a wild election gambit, to qualify their own electors in multiple states to try to insert chaos into the count of the Electoral College.  Clarence Manion, Radio Commentator: We can get our wish by qualifying a slate of American presidential elector candidates in our respective states. In a number of states, patriots are already far advanced on these necessary prerequisites. Maddow: To win the presidency without becoming the nominee of either major party, you’d need a gambit like that, because, of course, under normal electoral processes, it’s all but impossible for any third-party candidate to win, whether it would be McCarthy, or an anti-income tax candidate they also liked, or a Dixiecrat segregationist, or anyone else.  But even conservative columnists were sounding the alarm that, if anyone could do something like that, if anyone could pull it off, it would be McCarthy -- quote -- “McCarthy will have no compunctions at all about wrecking the Republican Party if this seems to serve his purposes. McCarthy has plenty of financial backing. He has important support in the press and on the radio. His supporters have the true mark of the fanatic. They are not interested in facts. The endless exposure of McCarthy’s endless untruths do not affect them.  His opportunities to stay in the news are unlimited. Can McCarthy reach the White House? Serious observers on Capitol Hill take seriously the possibility that McCarthy could ride to national power on the wreckage of the Republican Party. The idea does seem fantastic at first glance. But McCarthy has been consistently underrated. And this has been one of his greatest assets.”  With loud static like that coming from the far right, by the time the 1956 Republican National Convention loomed... Anchor: From San Francisco’s Cow Palace, the NBC radio coverage of the 1956 Republican National Convention. Maddow: …the Republican Party writ large determined that they would renominate Eisenhower and that there would be no convention shenanigans to get in the way of that.  Reporter: As the nation waits for the opening sound of the gavel, indications are that the convention will carry out its main purpose smoothly and efficiently. Maddow: Smoothly and efficiently. That was the idea. McCarthy’s devotees did not want to oblige.  Day three of the Republican National Convention, headline: “Dump Eisenhower Move Appears at Convention.” A so-called Conservative Republican Headquarters opens up on Market Street in San Francisco, not far from the official convention proceedings at the Cow Palace. They’re distributing anti-Eisenhower pamphlets and pins. They’ve got a petition with a hundred thousand names on it. They’re recruiting delegates at the convention to their cause.  The activists there, including a young man by the name of Willis Carto, tell reporters their plan. They just need one convention delegate to start it, maybe a delegate from the South who doesn’t like how soft Eisenhower is on segregation. That delegate will pry open this convention by putting forward the name Joe McCarthy for the nomination. They’ll start an open convention. They’ll start a fight.  One columnist points out to the activists that McCarthy isn’t even there in San Francisco. He isn’t even at the convention. The activists brush this off -- quote -- “If he’s nominated, we can get him to fly here at a moment’s notice.”  It’s a good try. It’s an earnest try. But Joe McCarthy isn’t flying in to anywhere. And Eisenhower’s not budging off the Republican ticket, because the movement that has built itself around Joe McCarthy is about to outlive him.  Within days, it will be clear that Eisenhower will have the nomination.  Within five months, Eisenhower will be sworn in for a second term. And within nine months...  NBC Anchor: The news in brief, Wisconsin’s controversial Senator Joseph R. McCarthy is dead. McCarthy died at Bethesda Naval Hospital here about an hour ago from a liver ailment. Maddow: Joe McCarthy has drunk himself to death at the age of 48.  Among the things that will make it into McCarthy’s instant obituary the night of the shocking news of his death is his defense of the Nazis involved in the Malmedy massacre.  Anchor: There are those in this country who will see in his passing the loss to the nation of a great patriot. Then there are those who rejected this description and saw in Mr. McCarthy not a red hunter, but a headhunter. Several times, he seemed about to burst out of the relative obscurity of just another member of the Senate, notably when he came to the defense of Germans held involved in the ghastly World War II Malmedy massacres. The quiet, droning quality of his voice, boring into witnesses before his Senate committee, became known everywhere on this globe, known and imitated. His actions were cited by foreign governments, to the detriment of this country. He was soundly blasted here at home, but he had millions upon millions of devoted followers.  Maddow: Millions of devoted followers, who, it turns out, were all but inconsolable when he died.  Far-right preacher Gerald L.K. Smith suggested that McCarthy might have been murdered, or at least targeted fatally somehow by his opponents. He said a secret and Satanic campaign had been launched to -- quote -- “tax the resistance of the mind, the nerve and glandular system” of Senator McCarthy.  The neo-Nazi group the National Renaissance Party, which had started calling themselves Patriots for McCarthy, they went into full-blown mourning, holding annual requiem masses for Joe McCarthy in New York. They held them annually for years.  Radio host Clarence Manion, who had been the voice of that For America electoral vote scheme, he said McCarthy had been spectacularly martyred. Manion: Many years from now, readers of history may wonder why President Eisenhower did not use the spectacular martyrdom of McCarthy as an example of communist ruthlessness. David Austin Walsh, Historian: There’s something to the idea that McCarthy is this martyr figure who is embraced by conservative Americans across that sort of right-wing political spectrum as a martyr figure. Maddow: Historian David Austin Walsh.  McCarthy biographer Richard Rovere said that McCarthy was -- quote -- “in many ways, the most gifted demagogue ever bred on these shores. No bolder seditionist ever moved among us, nor any politician with a surer, swifter access to the dark places of the American mind.”  On those terms, Joe McCarthy had set in motion something that did not stop when he died, when he died so suddenly and so young.  Anchor: The Capitol, shocked by the suddenness of the death of Senator McCarthy, is piecing together the story only now. Maddow: Rovere described “the world of the daft and the frenzied, the compulsive haters who had followed earlier and lesser demagogues in the fascist and semi-fascist movements of the ‘30s and ‘40s.”  He said McCarthy had certainly locked up the support of that world, but he also greatly enlarged that world by adding to it -- quote -- “large numbers of regular Republicans who had coolly decided that there was no longer any respectable way of un-horsing the Democrats and that only McCarthy’s wild and conscienceless politics could do the job.”  In the wake of McCarthy’s death, that mix, wild and without conscience, would show itself, and soon, right there in San Francisco, where the FBI was finally about to get its man.  This is the final episode of “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Reporter: We’re coming up onto Geary Street now, and I can see the Saint Francis Hotel, and confetti is flying out into the air. Anthony Mostrom, Journalist: They could see that there was a little bit of evidence of burning on his lips. Manion: The spectacular martyrdom of McCarthy, an example of communist ruthlessness Thruston Morton, Republican National Committee Chairman: I have been asked if I think the election was stolen. My comment is this. Many people do.  Mostrom: He was standing in the kitchen trying to remain calm, kind of knowing that the jig was up. ******************************** Maddow: Episode 8: “Mystery Man.”  Narrator: This is the route of the flagships of American Airlines, serving 21 states from border to border, from coast to coast… Maddow: Wayne Kemp was working for American Airlines as a ticket clerk at Carter Field, the main airport in Fort Worth, Texas. It was a Friday afternoon, June 1960. During his shift that day, Wayne noticed a stray piece of luggage that had apparently been separated from its owner.  Nobody had come to pick it up. Maybe it had been overlooked and left behind on a connecting flight.  It was a really generic-looking suitcase: a large, gray Samsonite bag with no I.D. tag. But the airlines have protocols for these things, and so Wayne Kemp did what he was trained to do. He made doubly sure that no one was there in Fort Worth to claim it and then he took it aside and he carefully opened it to see if there was any identification inside.  The first thing he found was a passport. And that seemed like good news. Obviously, a passport would provide some identifying information. But the second thing he found was another passport. And then he found another one. Three passports from three different countries, all three with the same photo, but with three different names.  There were also credit cards, and travelers checks, and checkbooks, and driver’s licenses, and German press credentials, and seven different birth certificates, all with different names.  Ticket clerk Wayne Kemp called the FBI.  Tracing where the luggage had come from, which was New Orleans and where it seemed to have been heading to, which was California, the Dallas FBI agents got in touch with the FBI field office in San Francisco. The airline told them that, yes, in fact, a passenger had just landed in California and had reached out to them looking for his lost bag.  The passenger gave the name Richard Hatch. He told them he was staying in Oakland. The FBI told the airline to contact the man again and tell him to stay put: “Don’t go anywhere. We’ll bring the bag to you.” Soon, that gray Samsonite suitcase was on its way to an address in Oakland, along with a car full of special agents from the FBI, because the owner of that luggage, the man calling himself Richard Hatch, was someone the U.S. government had been searching for, for more than a decade.  It was American fugitive Francis Parker Yockey.  The agents waited for Yockey at the address he’d given. He told them his name was Richard Hatch. He said he was a photographer. He said he was living mostly in Mexico. They asked him to open the bag. At first, he expressed surprise at all these passports inside, all these birth certificates, these different forms of I.D., all in different names.  As the agents started to question him more aggressively, Yockey got tense. He finally conceded that he had known that the passports and the documents were there, but he said there was a logical explanation for it. The agents would later file in their report that Yockey said he refused to give them that logical explanation -- quote -- “on the basis that he would be misunderstood.”  As the grilling intensified, one of the FBI agents later wrote in the report that he noticed the man -- quote -- “moving toward the door.”  The agent asked him if he wanted to sit down, but he said, no, that he would rather stand. And then, with these FBI agents standing just a few feet away, he bolted.  Mostrom: Yockey was standing in the kitchen of this little duplex trying to remain calm, kind of knowing that the jig was up, and an FBI agent was keeping his eye on Yockey, when Yockey suddenly bolted out the door and attempted to run down the stairway and take off.  Maddow: That’s journalist Anthony Mostrom.  Yockey bolted out of the apartment. An agent leapt after him in pursuit. Yockey slammed the door on that agent’s hand, cutting it open. The agent would end up needing 28 stitches. Yockey ran down a back staircase. He started making a break for it down the street. Another agent came rushing out of the front door, and tackled him. Got him.  Yockey was put under arrest after more than a decade on the run, after going AWOL to avoid questioning about the Nazi sabotage plot in the U.S. during World War II. Anchor: They brought with them a great store of explosives. Maddow: After flipping against the American government to help the Nazis in Germany at the Nazi war crimes trials. Reporter: All of the defendants have been taken out of the courtroom. Maddow: After fleeing Army counterintelligence to go to Ireland to write his fascist book, “Imperium,” after hooking up with escaped Nazis in South America and trying to sell black market plans for a cobalt bomb in the Middle East. Drew Pearson, Journalist: The radioactive dust would reach California in about a day. Maddow: After somehow eluding years of FBI surveillance including while he spoke at segregationist, antisemitic U.S. rallies and wrote a speech for Senator Joe McCarthy. Fmr. Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-WI): Communists or worse. Maddow: After all that, Francis Yockey was finally in custody.  And then, because of course, things got even weirder.  His arrest was front-page news in the Bay Area.  Mostrom: The San Francisco Chronicle’s front page blared out “Mystery Man Seized With Three Passports. Passport Subject Called Top Fascist.”  Maddow: The mystery man seized with fake passports. It -- quote -- “caused the wires to hum between here and Washington last night.” Quote -- “‘This is definitely a security matter,’ a government spokesman said. Both the State Department and the Department of Justice are interested in this man. One government source said last night: ‘This is not a small fish. This is a man that we are very, very interested in.’” A photo of Yockey handcuffed in custody appeared in the papers, as reporters there started trying to piece it together. Yockey soon had a series of court appearances.  Mostrom: The reporters who covered Yockey’s bail hearing in a San Francisco courtroom described a sullen, silent mystery man with an odd stare. Maddow: At his bail hearing, prosecutors cited -- quote -- “the unusual circumstances of this case” in making a bail request that was extraordinarily high. They asked for $50,000 bail, more than half-a-million dollars in today’s money.  The FBI said they didn’t want to go into detail about the case and the bail request, telling reporters only -- quote -- “There are lots of questions that haven’t been answered and we want him around.”  The judge overseeing the bail hearing told the government -- quote -- “I don’t know what you may have in your minds, but to justify this kind of bail, you’re going to have to make a case on the record.”  The federal prosecutor handling the hearing was William P. Clancy. He said that the U.S. attorney’s office had been instructed by Washington to not say anything more. Prosecutors did tell the judge that the high bail was indicative of the government’s great interest in the man. They also explained that they’d found him with a weapon in the first cell that they put him in, a comb with all the teeth removed and the end sharpened.  The prosecutor, William Clancy, told the court that Yockey was -- quote -- “an extreme risk of flight.”  And maybe he was.  You don’t accumulate three passports and seven birth certificates all in different names without some kind of weird resources. Prosecutors then told the judge that they had learned of an escape plot. In the San Francisco jail, Yockey had approached another prisoner who was being held on a $1,000 bail. Yockey had had more than twice that amount on him in cash when he was arrested.  He told the prisoner that he’d pay for his bail if the man would then get a gun once he was out. Yockey told him he should hide in Dunbar Alley, where the U.S. Marshals picked up prisoners from the jail to take them for their federal court hearings. When the Marshals brought Yockey out of the jail, the man was supposed to ambush them, so Yockey and another prisoner could make a run for it.  Unfortunately for Yockey, the prisoners who he approached about this plan went straight to the FBI. After the escape plan was exposed, Yockey was moved to a new cell. He was searched thoroughly for anything that could be used as a weapon, for anything that could be used in a suicide attempt.  FBI records show jailhouse informants telling them that Yockey bragged that he had plenty of money from something involving all those forged passports, from something involving Egypt. One informant remembered him using the word “Suez.”  Informants told the FBI that Yockey -- quote -- “expressed admiration for the late Senator Joseph McCarthy.”  While he was in jail, prosecutors and the FBI and other interested government agencies were awkwardly negotiating among themselves and with Washington about who was allowed to know what about this case and about this man.  In an FBI memo that is still heavily redacted today, an FBI special agent in charge is described as having received some important information about Yockey on the night of June 16, 1960, while Yockey was still in the San Francisco jail -- quote -- “Special Agent in Charge Auerbach, on the evening of June 16, received the following information: ‘Blank. Blank related that blank reportedly has a complete file pertaining to blank, which contains considerable information that is in conflict with other information received to date. Blank. In view of the source of the aforementioned information, this data should not be disseminated to other agencies, and not discussed with personnel outside the bureau.”  Then the memo continues -- quote -- “Assistant U.S. Attorney Clancy,” the prosecutor in Yockey’s case, “indicated during the evening of June 16 that he had come into the possession of a -- quote -- ‘super secret’ file regarding Yockey, which was -- quote -- ‘dynamite.’” It is noted that Special Agent Blank and Blank were planning to contact Assistant U.S. attorney Clancy during the afternoon of June 17 to determine the nature of the aforementioned file. So, on the night of June 16, with Yockey in jail, the FBI learns that someone has a -- quote -- “complete file” on Yockey that the bureau is concerned should not be shared with other agencies. That same night, the prosecutor handling Yockey’s case tells the FBI that he has obtained a super secret file on Yockey, which he calls dynamite. It is not an FBI file.  The FBI, in fact, makes plans to get its hands on that file the following day. But the following day, June 17, the whole case changes fatally. Guards come to Yockey’s cell to wake him for breakfast. They find him lying on his cot arms crossed, nonresponsive. There are no visible injuries that the guards can see, except for what looks like it might be a chemical burn on his lips.  Mostrom: They could see that there was a little bit of evidence of burning on his lips, which told them right away that he had probably taken something, taken poison, like Hermann Goering and all the Nuremberg defendants, you know, before him. Maddow: Yockey had just been moved to a new cell and thoroughly searched days earlier. There were no bottles or containers or envelopes found in his cell. But, somehow, he had got ahold of a capsule of cyanide, which did have an echo of Nuremberg.  Reporter: Wilhelm Hermann Goering, guilty on four counts, escaped his fate of hanging by committing suicide less than three hours before he would have been executed, taking cyanide of potassium. Maddow: The newspapers soon reported strange details about Yockey’s death. He was found lying on his cot in his underwear and in a pair of -- quote -- “storm trooper-style boots,” which raises the question, among other things, how? How did he manage to get storm trooper-style boots in jail, and how did he get the poison? How did any of this happen? Mostrom: He did manage to obtain potassium cyanide, and that, of course, is one of the enduring mysteries of the Yockey saga. Who slipped him the cyanide? Maddow: It’s worth noting that Francis Yockey did have one final visitor from the outside just before his death, a man who came to see him at the jail.  Mostrom: Yockey received one visitor that we know of in the San Francisco jail. And that was an obscure right-wing activist and publisher named Willis Carto. Maddow: Willis Carto. The same Willis Carto who had helped lead the doomed effort to get Joe McCarthy nominated for president at the Republican Convention in San Francisco. Reporter: We’re coming up onto Geary Street now, and I can see the Saint Francis Hotel, and confetti is flying out into the air. Maddow: When Willis Carto wasn’t trying to get a soon-to-be-dead Joe McCarthy onto the Republican presidential ticket he had been busy in ways that kept catching the eye of the FBI.  There was the German American Bund leader who had been arrested and imprisoned after he was found to be linked to the Operation Pastorius Nazi sabotage plot during World War II. When he got out of prison and FBI agents paid him a visit, they found that he had started a new pro-Joe McCarthy group in the Midwest, and that his new Nationalist Conservative Party was listed in a directory of far-right groups that was assembled by Willis Carto.  The FBI had infiltrated the neo-Nazi National Renaissance Party in New York, which was publishing Yockey’s antisemitic essays, and which Yockey himself had joined under one of his aliases. Willis Carto was in correspondence with the group’s leader, James Madole, exchanging complaints about white people -- quote -- “standing at the gateway of racial extinction.” Carto was in correspondence with segregationist leaders organizing support for federal legislation that had been put forward by America First Senator Bill Langer, a bill that proposed to round up Black Americans and send them to Africa.  When groups advocating for that bill came under suspicion in connection with a series of anti-Black and anti-Jewish bombings in the American south, Carto was interviewed about his ties to anyone who might have been involved. The FBI also asked Carto whether he knew the whereabouts of a man named Francis Yockey.  And so, when San Francisco papers erupted with the news of this mysterious fascist, this man Yockey who had turned up at the San Francisco jail, Willis Carto knew enough to know that he had to meet him. Carto wrote about attending one of Yockey’s court hearings as if he had come face to face with a god -- quote -- “As his gaze swept across, and then to me, he stopped and, for the space of a fractional second, spoke to me with his eyes. In that instant, we understood that I would not desert him.”  Carto then wrangled a private visit with Yockey in jail.  Mostrom: “Dimly, I could make out the form of this man, this strange and lonely man, through the thick wire netting. I knew that I was in the presence of a great force and I could feel history standing aside me.”  Maddow: Oh, get a room.  Willis Carto’s jailhouse meeting with Yockey came under the guise of an antisemitic, pro-segregation newsletter he was publishing that was called “Right.”  When Yockey turned up dead, Carto claimed in his newsletter that Yockey’s death should be blamed, of course, on the Jews -- quote -- “Convinced that only his dynamic philosophy of cultural vitalism could save the white race, he went to Brittas Bay, Ireland, in 1948. Isolated, he wrote ‘Imperium,’ a book which will live 1,000 years.”  Carto said -- quote -- “From the moment of publication of this book, his doom was sealed, for it must have become apparent to international Jewry at that time that Yockey had to be destroyed.” Carto would soon begin reprinting and selling “Imperium.” It had previously been almost impossible to get only a few hundred copies published in England in the 1940s. But under Willis Carto, “Imperium” would be available as a cheap paperback with an eye-catching cover and a long new introduction by Carto praising the book, praising Yockey as the salvation of the Western world and the White race.  Mostrom: Carto was completely converted to it. He sold “Imperium” by mail for years and years through his newspaper, “The Spotlight.”  Maddow: Willis Carto soon founded something called Liberty Lobby. He began publishing a newspaper for it called “The Spotlight.”  Within ten years, the Liberty Lobby would be one of the most aggressive and effective far-right political pressure groups in the country “The Spotlight” would be the highest-circulation right-wing publication in America, by far.  All the while, as Willis Carto’s organizations and publications rose in influence in Republican and conservative politics, he would stay true to what he had decided in 1960 would be his life’s mission, to carry on the legacy and the message of his hero, Francis Yockey.  But, in 1960, in the immediate aftermath of Yockey’s death, there was more to do. With McCarthy gone and Yockey gone, and both of them mourned and celebrated as martyrs, the movement they had both been part of and built and left behind, it had something else to offer American politics and this so-called democracy that kept failing them again and again.  The conclusion of “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra” is next.  ******************************** It should have been clear on election night, when the Republican candidate’s supporters refused to accept the results. It’s November 1960. The country is gripped by a nail-biter, down-to-the-wire presidential election between the Democrat, John F. Kennedy, and Republican Richard Nixon.  It’s around 3:00 a.m. on election night. And as it’s finally starting to become clear that Nixon has lost -- by a thin margin, but he’s lost -- Nixon goes out to talk to his supporters. He wants to let them down gently.  Richard Nixon, Presidential Candidate: As I look at the board here, while the -- there are still some results still to come in, if the present trend continues, Mr. Kennedy, Senator Kennedy, will be the next president of the United States  (CROWD YELLS NO!) Maddow: In any presidential campaign, especially on election night, passions run hot. Sometimes, it’s harder for supporters to accept defeat than even for the candidate himself. Nixon knows that.  But he also knows the math. He knows it’s over.  And so, following that initial reaction from his supporters, that chorus of “No, no, no” that had just rained down on him, Nixon tries again. He thanks the crowd for their enthusiasm and their support, but he wants to assure the country, he wants to assure the incoming president-elect that he and his supporters will accept the election’s results.  Nixon: I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard-fought, as this one is hard-fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected. I want all of you to know... (SHOUTING) Nixon: I want all of -- I want -- I... (APPLAUSE) Nixon: I want -- I want Senator Kennedy to know and I want all of you to know that, certainly, if this trend does continue and he does become our next president, that he will have my wholehearted support and yours too.  (BOOING) Maddow: In that moment, it might have been clear where all of this was heading  In the immediate aftermath of that very-closely-contested election, Willis Carto decided it was time to debut the new national publication of his group, Liberty Lobby. The mailing list was surprisingly large. Carto had always been good at that logistical side of his organizing.  But where his previous newsletter had been targeted to an extreme right-wing audience, with screeds against Jewish people and racial mongrelization and all-but-explicit endorsements of Nazism, this new publication, “The Liberty Letter,” would aim for a more mainstream audience, a more mainstream Republican audience.  And there was good reason now, a good hook, for rushing out this first issue just after the election. Republicans needed to know that this election had been stolen, or at least it was in the process of being stolen, but there was a way to stop it, to stop the steal.  This was the big headline from Carto, page one: “Kennedy Has Not Won the Election.”  He explained that the votes apparently cast for Kennedy had been fraud, that the fraud could and would be proven, but, in the meantime electors in the contested states, for example, from Georgia, those electors should not be counted for Kennedy under any circumstances.” Carto wrote: “Unless some action is shown at once, Kennedy will claim the White House.” Quote: “Will no one stop them?”  Carto said a mass mobilization on the right could prevent the transfer of power to Kennedy. He wrote: “This urgent event can happen between now and January.” The electors plot that they had promoted, but never tried in 1956, they should actually do it now in this next election, in 1960.  And Carto would not be alone. The cause would soon be joined by Gerald L.K. Smith.  Gerald L.K. Smith, Preacher: God, let me be a rabble-rouser! Maddow: Gerald L.K. Smith, the antisemitic far-right preacher, blasted out a message to his followers, that at that very moment he was in discussions with -- quote -- “governors, congressmen, judges, and crusading patriots” about reversing the results of the election.  He said he was working -- quote -- “to persuade at least four Southern Governors to assert their leadership in this crisis moment in world history.”  Specifically, Smith was telling governors to change the results in their states, to send Nixon electors to Washington, even though Kennedy had won the vote in those states. He said the -- quote -- “campaign of pressure” he was overseeing would persuade Republican elected officials all across the country that they could overturn the election results in their states to -- quote -- “save the nation.”  Smith told his followers he had rock-solid evidence that Kennedy -- quote -- “stole the election.” Quote -- “Convincing evidence concerning thievery in numerous states is being assembled.”  He called it “a deadly moment in American history,” but he said it could all be stopped if they mobilized together. The election may be done, the votes may be in, but the result hasn’t been finalized, so it isn’t over. There’s still a way to stop it, in Washington, in Congress, when the Electoral College votes are cast, and when they’re counted in the first week of January. That’s where they could stop it.  Gerald L.K. Smith and Willis Carto, one who had campaigned for president on a platform of sterilizing and deporting all Jewish people from America, one who would be the publisher and most fervent evangelist for America’s “Mein Kampf,” both brought into electoral politics through their allegiance to the same shockingly powerful, deeply flawed Washington demagogue, now they’re working together to try to discard the democratic process and its outcomes, to throw out the results of an election.  The Nixon campaign and the Republican Party, which had effectively conceded the race already, they nevertheless had their heads turned by this new effort led by the Republican Party chairman.  Morton: I have been asked if I think the election was stolen. My comment is this. Many people do. And many people have come to me with examples of fraud and irregularity. It’s my responsibility to investigate. Where there’s so much smoke, I must look for the fire. Maddow: “Many people do” believe the election was stolen.  The Republican Party chairman vowed that he would leave -- quote -- “no stone unturned” in investigating all of this supposed fraud.  Morton: I have also been asked who I think will be the next president of the United States. I predict an inauguration will take place on January 20th, and, of course, I feel that it will be Jack Kennedy, although, as always, the possibility that enough states may be overturned in the recount to negate what we think today are the election results. Maddow: Yes, we know how this is going to turn out, but what’s the harm? What’s the harm in just indulging these stolen election fantasies just a little bit? There’s always the possibility.  In the end, of course, it didn’t work. JFK was sworn in as president. There was an uninterrupted peaceful transfer of power. But that move, that move after that election to stop the steal, to call the election results false, to try to get election officials to overturn the results, in some ways, it was a kind of flag on the timeline, a bullet point reminder of what happens when fundamentally antidemocratic forces get brought in to work their dark magic in real politics.  If you come from a world where democracy is not your preferred choice. If, for example, you think we should have fought on the other side in World War II. If you come from a world where there are whole groups of other Americans who you think should be sterilized, or deported, or exterminated. Let’s be honest, you’re not all that excited about casting your vote alongside those Americans with everyone as equal citizens.  If you have told yourself that Jewish people or some other cabal secretly controls everything and what appears to be democracy is really a sham, then what do you care about the product of that democracy? What do you care about election results?  And if you believe those things, but you’re a lonely crank on the fringe shouting at a cloud about it, well, knock yourself out.  But if you’re invited in, if you, Gerald L.K. Smith, are invited to the Senate to bring your fake story about the Jewish Defense Department official Anna Rosenberg being a secret communist. If you, Eustace Mullins, author of “The Biological Jew,” is invited to supply anti-communist research for a senator’s staff. If you, the uniformed storm troopers of the National Renaissance Party, are to host the senator for his speech which will be written for him by the author of America’s “Mein Kampf.” If innocent American G.I.s are to face sheafs of made-up antisemitic cartoon caricature horror stories shipped direct to Capitol Hill from Munich from a leader of Germany’s successor Nazi party.  If violent forces that seek the end of the American system of government are tapped and brought in to electoral politics, there’s no reason to expect that what happens next will be constrained by respect for election results.  There have always been some Americans who liked the idea of other systems of government better than ours, who admired foreign dictators and authoritarians, who wanted something like that here, a system with their own strongman, with them on top, and everybody else can finally just shut up, or face the consequences.  Americans with ideas like these have flocked to movements like America First, which tried to keep us from fighting the Nazis. They have flocked to demagogues like Joseph McCarthy and others, politicians who understood the kind of dark wells they were drawing from, and they liked it, politicians who stayed themselves mostly in electoral politics, but they drew in and cultivated and used the menace of the persistently and legitimately antidemocratic forces in our country to give the movement around them not just a thrillingly transgressive vibe, but a real air of menace, a real air of threat.  Activating the real radicals, radicalizing the normies, causing real fear among Americans who would oppose them or stand in their way.  These politicians’ followers don’t much care about the electoral program of the politician they embrace. They don’t much care about deficit spending or relations with China or whether he actually exposes any real communists, or whether he cheats on his wife or on his taxes or on them in what always seems to be a constant grift.  What they care about is that he’s powerful. He’s willing to be brutal, and crude and mean. He does instill fear. He doesn’t shrink from violence. He colors outside the lines without guilt or hesitation. He’s uncontrollable, unstoppable, unshameable. That appeals, because that means he will break this system.  That is the appeal. That’s the whole idea.  You don’t take down a figure like that by pointing out his hypocrisies and his policy shortcomings. You take him down by stopping him from doing what he’s trying to do, by showing that he can’t actually break the American system of government, because, look, there it is holding firm against him, showing his followers that he’s not superhuman, he’s not stronger than how this country was built.  The American system of government, our democracy and our rule of law is far from perfect. But it is the kind of system that, when it works well, it works against cheats and frauds and violent thugs.  And so, against a man and a movement arrayed against the American system of government, it takes Americans in government and inside the American system to push back hard, like senators, Tydings, Benton, Flanders, Hunt.  It takes Americans in the free press like Drew Pearson and Marquis Childs.  These Americans did nothing particularly inventive to fight Joe McCarthy. They were just brave enough to actually fight him. And it didn’t seem like it was working at the time. And it was costly to all of them. And it took all of them, but it worked.  Baldwin calling out McCarthy’s lies on Malmedy. Tydings calling out McCarthy’s lies on communists in government. That put both of them in the firing line for McCarthy, and they both paid for it with their careers. But the record they built of those lies became the basis for the expulsion resolution against McCarthy from Benton.  And that put Benton on the firing line for McCarthy too, and he too paid with his career. But Benton’s expulsion resolution exposed more about McCarthy. It exposed his financial corruption, which McCarthy couldn’t answer to and refused to answer to.  And that mattered, because when Lester Hunt stood up next, threatening the immunity McCarthy depended on to operate the way he did, the resultant blackmail drive against Hunt led to Hunt’s death.  And that put enough steel in the spines, barely enough, but enough, for Republicans to finally support taking some kind of stand. And, yes, it was barely half of them, and it was none of the so-called leaders. But it was enough.  And that weak censure, that condemnation, that little rules and decorum violation they finally barely felt brave enough to get him on, what that was technically about was his refusal to face questions about that evidence of his financial corruption that had turned up because of the old expulsion resolution that hadn’t seemed to go anywhere, that hadn’t seemed, at the time, to matter. Until, in the end, it did. It all added up.  No one blow was enough, but, together, they all were.  McCarthy’s biographer, Richard Rovere, wrote that McCarthy’s decline -- quote -- “was more difficult to account for than his ascent. He suffered defeats, but not destruction. Nothing of a really fatal consequence had happened.” But, still, he said -- quote -- “He collapsed.”  It’s never going to be just one blow that takes down the demagogue. It’s going to take more than that. It’s going to take 10 blows, or 100. But not a million. The American system of government is strong, too. It just needs brave Americans to believe that and to show it and to step up, despite the costs.  Willis Carto did go on to decades of influence on the American right. His group Liberty Lobby had a big office on Capitol Hill. It had the largest-circulation right-wing publication in the country for years. It had its staffers and advisers promoted for government positions in multiple Republican administrations.  All the while, Carto kept the flame burning for Francis Yockey and what Yockey stood for. Drew Pearson dogged Carto for years, reporting relentlessly on his extremism. Carto kept suing Drew Pearson to try to get him to stop, but he lost every case. Pearson never gave up.  Willis Carto died in 2015. At his death, he was remembered as having done more than any other American in history to promote and spread the lie that is Holocaust denial.  Thanks to Carto’s devotion to the cause, Francis Yockey’s book “Imperium” never did go out of print. And it seems like it’s newly discovered every few years now by some new iteration of the very far right.  In 1998, in Jasper, Texas, a Black man named James Byrd Jr. was chained to the bumper of a pickup truck and dragged to his death in a horrific hate crime. Three white supremacists were arrested and convicted. And then there, at the sentencing, was the name Francis Yockey again.  Jackson: At the sentencing of one of the murderers, he quoted Francis Parker Yockey to justify his own actions. So, you know, it’s still out there. It’s still being read. Maddow: At a Vatican conference, when Republican presidential campaign manager and senior White House adviser Steve Bannon cited an Italian fascist named Julius Evola, it set off a wave of excitement across the very far right.  In most recent reprints of Yockey’s “Imperium,” and there are many, it’s Julius Evola’s glowing review of “Imperium” that is included as an afterword with the book.  Mostrom: It’s very evident that there are people in power who have read “Imperium” and take its neo-fascist message very seriously. Maddow: Francis Yockey’s peculiar anti-American vision of destroying a multiracial democratic United States, to instead make us a white, fascist nation in league with Russia, it was weird in 1948. It was still weird in 2017, at Charlottesville.  Charlottesville Ralliers: Russia is our friend! The South will rise again! Russia is our friend! The South will rise again!  Maddow: There’s a so-called Dark Enlightenment antidemocratic philosophy that’s taken hold among the very, very online American right wing and their favorite politicians on the ragged edge of the Republican Party. The literary canon of that movement is published in part by Imperium Press.  Yockey’s “Imperium” has even inspired its own modern-fascist political party in Europe, Imperium Europa. It’s active in European parliamentary elections even right now.  Senator Herman Welker of Idaho was one of two Republicans who helped McCarthy in his blackmail campaign against Lester Hunt. Herman Welker was so devoted to McCarthy that his nickname was “Little Joe From Idaho.” After McCarthy died in May of 1957, Herman Welker also died before the end of that year. He was only 50 years old.  The other senator involved in the blackmail plot was Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire. When he died in 1961, he had somehow accumulated millions of dollars in cash, which he had stuffed into suitcases that he stashed with friends and staffers, under instructions that they should deliver the luggage unopened to his widow upon his death.  When it came time to bury Senator Bridges, his widow reportedly asked LBJ what she should do with all that cash. A big chunk of Interstate 93 in New Hampshire is still named after Republican Senator Styles Bridges today.  The retired admiral who headed up the petition effort against McCarthy’s censure, who had ordered the armored truck guards to draw their pistols at the doors of the Senate, he ran for office himself multiple times in his home state of Alabama. He ran as a segregationist and an antisemite.  In his 1956 race for U.S. Senate, he made multiple campaign appearances with a Klan leader who had orchestrated the beating of Nat King Cole on stage in the middle of a performance, at the Birmingham Municipal Auditorium. By 1964, the FBI would be investigating Admiral Crommelin’s alleged role in a plan with other former senior military officers to forcibly overthrow the U.S. government. He was never charged.  John Crommelin and his brothers today have a U.S. Navy frigate named after them. Crommelin was named to the Alabama Military Hall of Fame in 2003, amid some complaints.  Gerald L.K. Smith lived until 1976. He remained a Holocaust denier his whole life. He is remembered most today for a 60-foot-tall statue called “Christ of the Ozarks” which he erected in Arkansas in 1966. He’s buried beneath it. Its detractors call it “Our Milk Carton With Arms.”  Senator Lester Hunt’s son Buddy married. He had kids. He was a well-regarded community organizer and then a college professor. When he was 87 years old, he wrote to the U.S. Justice Department asking for a formal review of the circumstances of his father’s death. After all, blackmail is a crime. As far as we have been able to tell, Buddy never received a response before he died.  The U.S. Justice Department appears to have never investigated the blackmail campaign against U.S. Senator Lester Hunt, nor did the United States Senate.  In 2023, a Republican state legislator in Wyoming whose family had been friends and neighbors with Senator Hunt decided to ask the state legislature in Wyoming to pass a simple resolution commemorating the service of Lester Hunt, who had served as secretary of state and as a two-term governor, and as U.S. senator.  His fellow Republicans in the legislature voted it down.  Nazi defense lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer didn’t die until the 1980s. He was active in Holocaust denial and neo-Nazi causes his whole life. His last publication, in 1983, was a fake autobiography of the Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann, who’d fled Germany and hidden in Argentina after World War II.  Aschenauer claimed that he found memoirs from Eichmann that proved that the Nazis had never really wanted to kill any Jews at all, that it was all just a big misunderstanding.  Thanks to the efforts of Aschenauer and the antisemitic Atlanta lawyer Willis Everett and, of course, Republican U.S. Senator Joe McCarthy no one ever served considerable time, let alone faced execution, for Malmedy, for the worst massacre of unarmed American POWs in World War II.  First, the dozens of death sentences were all commuted, and then all of the Nazis were let go. The last one to be released was the Blowtorch Battalion’s commanding officer, Joachim Peiper, who eventually moved to France. In 1976, he was murdered in an arson attack. An underground, anonymous group of Holocaust survivors claimed credit for killing him.  On the wall of Joe McCarthy’s apartment in Washington, McCarthy hung a sledgehammer mounted in a frame. On it were painted the words, “For Drew Pearson Only.”  When crusading columnist Drew Pearson died in the fall of 1969, he was the most widely syndicated columnist in the United States. His funeral was held at Washington National Cathedral.  Pearson: McCarthy abused American army officers because they convicted the Nazis who shot 150 American soldiers in cold blood at Malmedy. What McCarthy did not like from a newspaperman then and what he doesn’t like from his fellow senators now is anyone who opposes him or exposes him. I predict that Senator McCarthy will have no more luck bulldozing his fellow senators than he had in silencing me and that, despite his usual divisive tactics, they will pull together to keep this nation strong and make democracy live. Maddow: We have these moments in American history. These recurrent, delicate moments where our democracy feels mortal, fragile.  But the Americans who fought these fights before us left us their stories, of courage, to show us how.  “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra” is a production of MSNBC.

Ross, who’s been wise counsel to us. His book “Hitler in Los Angeles” was such a key source for season one of “Ultra.” If you’re curious about whatever happened to the National Renaissance Party and James Madole, that story turns out to be so bizarre, you absolutely will not believe it, but it will all be told in Steven J. Ross’s next book, “The Secret War Against Hate,” which is out in 2025. Cannot wait.  Oh, and one other thing. In 1957, the British government did test a nuclear bomb with cobalt in it. It was a failed test and a little bit of a scandal. But it wasn’t a doomsday weapon of the kind described on the radio that day by physicist Leo Szilard. That kind of a bomb has never been built.  Wyoming State Senator: This is Senate Joint Resolution 2, recognizing the service of Lester C. Hunt to be presented to us by Senator Case. State Sen. Cale Case (R-WY): Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I’m very grateful to be here. I would just like to read a little of this newspaper to you to start off: “Cheyenne was a quiet, respectful city last night, as the body of Senator Lester C. Hunt was brought home for funeral services. A silent crowd of hundreds watched the Air Force DC-6 carrying one of the state’s best loved statesmen landed.  “Army National Guard units representing every corner of the State snapped to attention and rendered a final salute to the man who gave more than 20 years of his life to public office. A plane carrying 17 Congressional leaders and personal representatives of President Dwight Eisenhower preceded the plane carrying Hunt’s body and members of his family.  “Cars choked the access streets. And at every home -- cars choked the access streets. And, at every home, people lined the curb paying a silent tribute to the senator. There were tears in the eyes of many. Old men stood at attention. Children were silent. The group numbered into the thousands, police said.” My father was there that day. He was one of the honorary pallbearers. I don’t think that this story’s ever gotten the respect from Wyoming that -- that, really, it’s called for.  Anyway, that’s the darn story. And it’s a -- it’s a big story. And so, I thought it’d be good if we did a resolution to recognize this."
