It’s obvious Republicans have no idea what to do about Tim Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-extremist-trump-maga-popular-rcna165895,"According to an actual tweet from the New Hampshire Libertarian Party, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Vice President Kamala Harris chose as her running mate last week, “has been a leech his entire life.” The message proceeded to list the various self-serving positions Walz has held, including “public school teacher” and “veteran.” If that sounds deranged, well, that’s because it is. The Trump campaign and its surrogates in the conservative media ecosystem have been desperately trying to paint the 60-year-old Walz as Che Guevara with a Midwestern accent. “This is the most woke, left-wing candidate she could have picked, out of all the names that surfaced,” former American Conservative Union head Matt Schlapp said. That’s obviously untrue. If Harris wanted to swing hard left, she could have chosen any number of progressives: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sens. Sherrod Brown or Bernie Sanders, or even twice-failed former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. They were all about as close to her short list as I was to starting as power forward for the New York Knicks. Instead, she picked “a Norman Rockwell painting sprung to life,” David Axelrod, the mastermind of former President Barack Obama’s political rise, quipped the other day on NPR. On Thursday, Trump held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in which he described Walz as dangerous and out of touch with Americans. In fact, Walz is firmly within the American consensus when it comes to actual policy: He is strongly in favor of reproductive choice, as are 85% of Americans, to some extent; Walz enacted paid family leave, another wildly popular policy; as governor, he has pushed for Minnesota to get its energy from renewable resources, in keeping with Americans’ growing recognition of the threat posed by catastrophic weather and elevated temperatures. If anything, Walz is so thoroughly in the center lane of the policy mainstream that even calling him a progressive may be something of an overstatement. Republicans, on the other hand, want to all but abolish the administrative state (through the Schedule F executive order Trump signed during his first term and hopes to implement in his second) while hounding women who cross state lines to seek abortions. Their version of freedom involves imposing a severe form of Christian nationalism on the country at large. And rather than even try to sell these radical ideas to ordinary Americans, they characterize dissenters as “childless cat ladies” or literal demons. Still, the GOP is trying to paint Walz as the Marxist from Minnesota. Bless their hearts. One loony right-wing activist suggested that Walz changed the flag of Minnesota to resemble that of Somalia. At some point you really have to wonder: How stupid do these people think we are? Judge for yourself. Walz would “unleash HELL ON EARTH,” Trump warned with his trademark restraint. If “hell on Earth” is making lunch free for children in public schools and legalizing cannabis, then Walz is indeed guilty as charged. He is a Midwestern progressive, in the tradition of Robert La Follette, Eugene McCarthy, Paul Wellstone and Al Franken. And he exudes genuine American warmth, the kind that was so refreshing to me and my family when we arrived here from the Soviet Union. “Tim Walz is the dad an entire generation wish[ed] they had instead of the one they lost to Fox News,” one social media user joked. The same country that welcomed my family, along with thousands of other Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union, could one day be led by JD Vance, who recently endorsed a book about how progressives are “unhuman.” Trump must be seething as the edgy, joyless Vance creepily follows Harris around the Midwest, where she and Walz have been drawing enormous crowds. At one event, a reporter asked Vance what made him smile. In response, Vance abruptly attacked the reporter, calling it a “bogus question.” Walz practically looks like JFK in comparison to this bearded disaster — and Trump must know it. “Republicans Simply Can’t Figure Out How to Knock Down Tim Walz,” went a recent Vanity Fair headline. Here’s a crazy idea: Don’t bother. Just offer better policies. Forget about Walz and simply tell the American people what you plan to do when you return to the Oval Office. Give them a reason to vote for you, and you won’t have to worry about the Democrats. For example, Trump tried to brand Walz as “Tampon Tim” for his support of transgender rights. As a matter of fact, Walz probably is to the left of most Americans when it comes to protections related to medical treatments for gender dysphoria. That gives Trump an opening — not to attack Walz, but to introduce ideas of his own. Of course, that’s very hard to do when your campaign is practically idea-free. So “Tampon Tim” it is. On the whole, I suspect Walz will provide a temporary boost to Harris in this critical early stretch while in the long run doing little to either help or hinder her campaign to any substantial degree. The right’s attacks on him are another matter. They reveal a paucity of ideas, a complete surrender to the Trumpian style of relentless attack. It’s an exhausting way to do politics. Even worse, it’s not very effective."
Why volleyball was one of the Paris Olympics' most underrated events,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/usa-vs-france-olympic-volleyball-primetime-paris-rcna165993,"The Paris Olympics draw to a close this weekend after two weeks of tragedy and triumph. But while many events (and athletes) have lived up to their top billing, I’d argue one sport remains conspicuously underrated. At a time when women’s sports are having a moment that is turning into a movement, and as the U.S. women’s volleyball team fights for the gold medal on Sunday against Italy, I believe more than ever that volleyball should be a featured sport of the Summer Games. For one thing, volleyball is arguably the only team sport that is quintessentially female. This is a relationship-based sport played with power and athleticism in a noncontact environment defined by interdependence and rapid scoring. It is also incredibly joyous, with encouragement and celebration a defining aspect of every play. There’s a reason that in the 50 years since Title IX opened athletics opportunities, girls have flocked to the court. Volleyball is also one of the only team sports in the U.S. to become mainstream without a more popular male counterpart. Per the National Federation of State High School Associations, more girls play volleyball than any other sport besides track and field. In August 2023, a college volleyball match drew the largest crowd in the world ever to attend a women’s sporting event as 92,003 fans crowded into Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium to watch Nebraska’s volleyball team beat Omaha in three sets. Indeed, the popularity of girls volleyball has led to a whole other opportunity for women in the NCAA. In 2012, beach volleyball was added to the NCAA’s “emerging sports” list and just four years later was made a championship sport. Today, almost 180 colleges support varsity beach teams, and the four women who represented the U.S. in Paris are products of American college teams. (Despite entering the Games with high hopes and higher expectations, both women’s beach teams were tragically bounced from the tournament earlier this week.) Nevertheless, the signs are clear. Volleyball and beach volleyball should be part of the prime-time Olympics rotation. Volleyball’s underrated status may have something to do with who is covering it. According to Richard Lapchick, chair of the DeVos Sport Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida, over 80% of sports editors, reporters and columnists were still men, at least in 2021. Nevertheless, we know the interest is there. In December 2023, the NCAA women’s volleyball championship was watched by 1.7 million people, a record for the sport. The Big Ten Network reported that volleyball was its third most popular sport behind football and men’s basketball — and that was back in 2019. Today, volleyball feels like it’s in the same place soccer was in not that many years ago. Media companies saw an opportunity and invested in coverage of the World Cup, the Premier League and MLS and NWSL matches. Today, most self-respecting sports fans can at least recognize offsides. Lionel Messi is a household name. The same could be true in volleyball — if the sport is given a chance. Television executives tend to be conventional thinkers and skew toward the risk-averse. But volleyball represents a real test of this burgeoning mainstream embrace of women’s sports. Can it become a success in the broader American marketplace? As an archetypal female sport and arguably the only major team sport not chasing a better funded, more broadly played, more widely understood male counterpart, volleyball is a litmus test. Can a women’s team sport not only survive but thrive on its own merits? Perhaps we will find out at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Fans and TV executives now have three years to familiarize themselves with hitting percentage, overlaps, and spread, commit and bunch blocking; we have three years to learn the names and the stories of star players like Kathryn Plummer, Jordan Larson, Annie Drews (and beach players like Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng). But in the meantime, the women’s team needs our support. Their match may not be featured in the prime-time lineup — it starts at 7 a.m. ET — but I know I’ll be watching."
Trump back in the White House would be very bad for the bears,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-endangered-species-grizzly-bears-gray-wolves-rcna164898,"Although former President Donald Trump has very  publicly distanced himself from the conservative Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 plan, we should take seriously much of what the 920-page document tells us about a potential second Trump term.   For one, if Trump wins in November, he may end federal protections for grizzly bears, gray wolves and the greater sage grouse, as the document proposes removing the three animals from the federal government’s list of endangered species. Environmental groups warn removing the species from protected lists would open them up to being hunted or killed by traps meant to protect farms and ranches while facing loss of critical habitat. Unsurprisingly, a politically-motivated group making decisions about protected and endangered species has the potential to create a ripple effect of problems.  As Andrea Zaccardi, a carnivore conservation legal director for the Center of Biological Diversity, points out, “The proponents of Project 2025 don’t understand that the protection of species is supposed to be a science-based decision and not a political one.”  Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973, the Endangered Species Act allows the federal government to protect species at risk of extinction from being killed, harmed or harassed. Once the population has rebounded, the species can be delisted, which leaves protection in the hands of state governments that environmentalists argue would not take strong enough action. Delisting endangered species is supposed to be done when federal scientists think it is no longer necessary, but it’s not unheard of to become political as well. Grizzly bears are a perfect example. Before western expansion, the lower 48 states had over 50,000 grizzly bears, with a range from Central Mexico to the Great Plains. But by 1975, when they were officially listed as an endangered species, the number of grizzlies in the continental United States had dipped below 1,000. Since then, they’ve been a success story, with a particularly successful effort to reintroduce grizzlies in a portion of Montana and the three states around Yellowstone National Park — the two areas where Project 2025 calls for delisting them. As of 2022, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem was estimated to have 965 bears, while the Northern Continental Divide in Montana was estimated at 1,138 — as much as triple the numbers in 1975. But the population of grizzlies has not improved much in two other ecosystems in Washington state and Idaho. Ivan London, a senior attorney at Mountain States Legal Foundation, said in an email that the grizzly bear should have never been listed under the Endangered Species Act in the first place. He argues that the government was wrong to divide the grizzly population into several ecosystems treated separately and should have considered the overall number of grizzlies in the entire United States. “The Endangered Species Act has turned into a lever of power that federal regulators use to extend their reach onto private and state property. This allows them to police activities that they would otherwise have no authority to oversee,” London said in an email. “Several ESA listings are based on outdated or otherwise questionable information, making the regulatory decisions to list or continue listing several species simply unreasonable. If the three species were delisted, the federal government would no longer have any say in protecting them. That would leave state governments entirely in charge of their future. For some critics of the listing, that’s the point. Mark Jones, national director for hunter outreach for Gun Owners of America, argues that the grizzly bear populations have rebounded enough that they should be delisted, and any effort to keep them on there is due to national politics interfering with the science. Jones, a Wyoming resident and a certified wildlife biologist, said that has “cheapened” the Endangered Species Act. “There’s a lot of resentment in Wyoming for the federal government because it’s ignoring its own law,” he said. But Zaccardi said there’s good reason to doubt that western states would take strong enough action. She notes that Idaho and Wyoming already passed laws that would allow trophy hunting of grizzly bears if they are delisted, while there would be strong incentives for state lawmakers to allow more killing of grizzlies and gray wolves, which will sometimes attack cattle and sheep. “The agricultural industry is not a big fan of predators,” she said. For now, grizzlies, gray wolves and the sage grouse are protected from trophy hunters, ranchers and real-estate developers. But that could change quickly if Trump wins in November, allowing politics to control an already politically charged policy. Ultimately, while some of the species have met the qualifications for delisting, the species are too fragile for removal. It should be the responsibility of all involved parties to keep animals under protection until science says it isn’t needed — not left to political manifestos and economics. "
"In his helicopter story, Trump may have confused Willie Brown with another Black politician",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 4:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-helicopter-willie-brown-nate-holden-rcna166097,"Donald Trump’s apparent confusion about a Black politician who was with him on a dangerous helicopter ride has highlighted his lack of credibility — and renewed concerns about the former president’s cognitive health. At a press conference on Thursday, the former president attacked Vice President Kamala Harris and recounted having experienced an emergency landing in a helicopter with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, whom he claimed to know “pretty well.” (Trump has repeatedly questioned whether Harris’ career was boosted by her relationship with Brown, whom she dated.) “We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing,” Trump said. “This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was — he was a little concerned.” Trump’s account raised eyebrows, given that news of such an incident involving him and Brown, who is 90, had never been previously reported. Brown quickly denied the claim, telling NBC News that he’d never even been in a helicopter with Trump. At the time, some outlets, including NBC News, speculated that Trump may have confused the former San Francisco mayor, who is Black, with former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who is white. In 2018, Trump had been in a helicopter with the then-governor and his successor, now-Gov. Gavin Newsom, to assess the damage from wildfires to the town of Paradise. But both Jerry Brown’s and Newsom’s teams denied that that helicopter ride was ever endangered; Jerry Brown’s spokesperson also told NBC News that there had been no discussion of Harris on that trip. Then on Friday, Nate Holden, a former Los Angeles City Council member and state senator, told Politico that he had in fact been in a helicopter with Trump when it made an emergency landing in the 1990s, and suggested that the GOP presidential nominee had confused Willie Brown with him instead. “Willie is the short Black guy living in San Francisco. I’m a tall Black guy living in Los Angeles,” said Holden, 95. “I guess we all look alike.” Trump’s brother Robert and an executive from his company, Barbara Res, were also aboard the helicopter with Holden. Res wrote about the incident in her memoir, and she told Politico that although Trump liked to joke that Holden “turned white” from fear during the emergency landing, it was in fact Trump who was “scared s---less.” The controversy raises questions about Trump’s mental fitness. At 78, Trump is facing the same concerns about his age and mental acuity that he has previously attacked 81-year-old President Joe Biden for — concerns that his torturously rambling and misleading Thursday press conference did very little to allay. Trump has continued to insist that he is not misremembering which politician was with him on the helicopter. On Friday, he claimed to The New York Times that he had flight records (though he did not produce them) and threatened to sue the newspaper. The Trump campaign did not respond to an NBC News request for comment."
Jordan Chiles may lose Olympic bronze in floor exercise after sport court ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 12:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jordan-chiles-bronze-floor-exercise-appeal-romanians-rcna166093,"UPDATE (August 11, 2024, 7:20 a.m. ET): The International Olympic Committee said Sunday that U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles must return her bronze medal in the floor exercise, upholding findings that a coach’s protest that got her on the podium shouldn’t have been allowed. USA gymnast Jordan Chiles’ bronze medal in the floor exercise is in jeopardy after a sporting arbitration body determined that an appeal for her score in the category was incorrectly granted. In a ruling issued on Saturday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said an inquiry request from Chiles’ coaches had been submitted four seconds after the one-minute deadline and is therefore void, and consequently her points should be lowered to her initial score. Chiles had been given a 13.666 score for her performance on Monday, which put her in fifth place behind Romania’s two gymnasts. Team USA coaches quickly filed an inquiry as to the difficulty of one of her moves, a tour jeté with a full turn, and the judges raised her score to 13.766, bumping her to third place. The sudden change in Chiles’ score clearly shocked Ana Barbosu, the Romanian gymnast who initially had the third-highest score. Barbosu had been holding her country’s flag, ready to celebrate making the podium, when she was bumped to fourth place. The Romanian Gymnastics Federation later filed multiple appeals to the CAS challenging the score adjustment. The CAS said in its Saturday ruling that the International Gymnastics Federation will determine the ranking of the final and assign the medals according to the court’s decision. The FIG has yet to make any public comment about the ruling. USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee said in a joint statement that they were “devastated” by the CAS’s ruling. They said the inquiry was “filed in good faith, and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring.” The groups also objected to the online harassment of Chiles over the score appeal: Chiles’ Instagram posts have been flooded with comments accusing her of “stealing” an Olympic medal from the Romanian gymnasts. Her mother, Gina Chiles, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the 23-year-old has received “racist disgusting comments.” After the ruling, Chiles posted heartbreak emojis on her Instagram story. She also wrote that she was removing herself from social media for her mental health."
What’s behind the incredible turnaround of the U.S. women’s soccer team,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 10, 2024, 10:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-womens-soccer-brazil-olympics-soccer-final-rcna165777,"UPDATE (August 10, 2024, 1:06 p.m. ET): On Saturday, the U.S. women’s national soccer team defeated Brazil 1-0 to win the Olympic gold medal. This is Team USA’s fifth gold in the Summer Games and its first since 2012. Questions frequently surround the U.S. women’s soccer team after any disappointing result, but those questions have rarely been louder than after the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup last summer. The U.S. stumbled out in the round of 16, its worst finish ever at a major international tournament. Key stalwarts like Megan Rapinoe and Julie Ertz retired. Fans and critics alike wrung their hands about an uncertain future. As the gold medal match in the 2024 Olympics kicks off Saturday, the future now feels much more certain. After a 12-year absence from the Olympic finals, the U.S. will square off against Brazil in Paris. The team has been reborn under new head coach Emma Hayes, and a young roster has made the squad its own. How has one year made such a difference? The credit starts with Hayes, who came to the U.S. job with years of experience winning trophies at her former team, Chelsea FC. The hiring wasn’t entirely without risk: Hayes had never managed an international team, and her commitments with Chelsea meant she only had a few matches with the U.S. before the Olympics started. But the gamble paid off. Hayes built a reputation for making players feel as confident as possible about what they did on the field. And the quotes coming from the U.S. camp suggest Hayes has given them more belief than they have had in quite some time. “We’re a different team since she’s come in,” said star striker Sophia Smith after the U.S. beat Germany in extra time in the semifinal. “We just needed someone to come in and believe in us. … Emma’s doing exactly that.” Is the team winning because of confidence, or is it confident because it’s winning? Plenty of confident teams lose all the time, after all. What is clear is that Hayes is connecting with the players as individuals. Many coaches wouldn’t quietly surprise their players with a visit from a nail technician for manicures during the competition. The gold medal game will only be Hayes’ 10th game in charge, an unprecedented lack of time for a U.S. head coach at a major tournament. Things aren’t perfect yet, but the work she has done has already exceeded expectations. Hayes’ preference for youth over veteran presence has paid off as well, particularly with a reborn attack. Before the tournament, striker Alex Morgan, who has scored more than 120 goals for the U.S., was surprisingly excluded from the Olympic roster. But the forward line of Smith (23), Mallory Swanson (26), and Trinity Rodman (22) — the self-declared “Triple Espresso” — has scored or assisted 10 of the United States’ tournament-leading 11 goals. Swanson, returning after a yearlong injury layoff, fits Smith’s and Rodman’s playing styles like a glove. Their fluid movement and innate chemistry have made the U.S. more dynamic than it was a year ago. Admittedly, the U.S. has only scored two goals across the quarterfinal and semifinal. But it has been battling heat and fatigue, thanks to playing five games in 13 days, two of which went to extra time. The team will be at its most rested entering Saturday’s final. If the Olympics have seen the U.S. attack in third gear, imagine what the team will be like when it’s able to hit the turbo button. While the forwards may draw attention with their goals, it’s Smith’s good friend Naomi Girma’s defending that has made the U.S. so dominant in France this summer. Few defenders can cover as much ground as Girma does. Those who do usually get beaten by opposing attackers and leave their goalkeeper dangerously exposed. That never happens to Girma. Her positional discipline frequently cuts off dangerous attacks before they can even develop. When players do challenge her, she is never wrong-footed. When they run past her, she effortlessly catches up and wins the ball without fouling the opposition. “She’s the best defender I’ve ever seen,” Hayes said after the semifinal. “Ever.” The U.S. has conceded two goals all tournament and is the only team competing for a medal that hasn’t conceded in the knockout stage. Girma is a massive reason why. Just 24 years old, she’s probably the best defender in the world right now. What will happen on Saturday? There’s plenty of history between these two sides, including the gold medal games in both 2004 and 2008. The U.S. won both. More recently, the team also defeated Brazil 1-0 in the CONCACAF W Gold Cup final in March. Marta, arguably the greatest women’s soccer player of all time, will play her final game in a Brazil jersey and will have much of the crowd behind her team in Paris as Brazil tries to win its first-ever major title. With the Americans in the middle of a roster and coaching transition over the last year, nobody would have been surprised if they weren’t competing for a gold medal. But they are here, and they have reasserted their place among the absolute elite in international women’s soccer."
Chris LaCivita sunk John Kerry's presidential campaign. Now he's trying to 'Swift-boat' Tim Walz.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 6:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/chris-lacivita-donald-trump-swift-boat-tim-walz-rcna166020,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 8 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.” Last month, Donald Trump looked ready to cruise back to the Oval Office. And now, Republicans can’t get people to stop calling them weird. Trump is melting down at Mar-a-Lago as he watches his poll lead evaporate against Vice President Kamala Harris.  At a time like this, a lot of campaign gurus might throw their old playbook out the window. But not Chris LaCivita — senior adviser to the campaign, known by insiders as one of Trump's top guys and the former president’s co–campaign manager.  For two decades, LaCivita has connected big Republican donors with candidates in trouble and helped them win with cutting personal attacks against their opponents. It’s a weird career niche that started with one dark money campaign. Back in 2004, a Super PAC by the name of “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” helped sink John Kerry’s presidential bid with a series of ads attacking the Democratic candidate’s military record.  And those ads were the work of LaCivita.  LaCivita’s attacks on Democratic candidates have, at times, even made his Republican clients uncomfortable. Early in his career, reporters described him as a “Republican hit-man,” using words like “hyperactive,” “manic” and “renegade.” And now, it appears LaCivita is running the old playbook, orchestrating the right-wing attacks on the 24-year military career of Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walls of Minnesota. I've already debunked those attacks. They are gross. So far, outside of the angry right-wing social media hellscape, they aren’t really landing the way the attacks on Kerry did. But there's more: The guy who made those attacks against Kerry possible 20 years ago was a donor named Harlan Crow. Yes, that Harlan Crow: the billionaire who has lavished gifts on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for decades. Crow ultimately gave LaCivita’s “Swift-boat” group tens of thousands of dollars. What’s to stop him from doing that again?  It’s also worth mentioning that LaCivita isn’t just a Trump campaign aide. This year he also became the de facto COO of the Republican National Committee, which gives him control over its campaign spending. It's said everything old is new again ... that includes in politics.

JD Vance is a bad nerd,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-nerd-magic-gathering-rcna165881,"Since former President Donald Trump tapped him to be his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has become the poster child for the Democrats’ new favorite word — “weird” — as his stiff demeanor and atrocious policy beliefs have been placed center stage. It’s in this harsh spotlight another of Vance’s traits has come to the forefront: He’s a big ol’ nerd. There have been pieces written about his devotion to the classic fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings” and the way it’s shaped his worldview. More recently, he and his wife, Usha Vance, gave interviews talking about his time playing “Magic: The Gathering,” a card game that draws heavily on fantasy tropes. I want to underscore that these two descriptors — “weird” and “nerd” — are not synonymous. As a card-carrying nerd myself, I would have to say that Vance’s love of stereotypically geeky interests has nothing to do with his creepy tendencies. If anything, he has shown himself to be the worst kind of nerd, one who reinforces the toxic masculinity that was at one point inseparable from overarching geekdom. It is to Vance’s discredit that he will likely be unable to see how deeply his rejection of all things “woke” isolates him from a community that has come to embrace the “good weird” that doesn’t fit into his homogenized vision of America. Let’s start with Vance’s ties to M:TG (not the GOP congresswoman from Georgia). Earlier this week, an interview with Usha Vance aired on “Fox & Friends,” aimed at helping to soften her husband’s image and defend his now infamous “childless cat ladies” comments. “He has all sorts of dorky interests that anyone of our age could relate to,” she told Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt. Those interests, Earhardt told her co-hosts, include playing the collectable trading card game. Vance denied that it was a current interest when Semafor asked him about it Wednesday, calling it a “phase.” More interesting, though, was the reason he said he ditched the game: He may have meant it as a laugh line, but it speaks to something very real about how gatekeeping has worked in nerd spaces. It’s true that back when Vance would have been playing, as depicted briefly in the movie adaptation of his book “Hillbilly Elegy,” the game was not exactly popular among young women. Even as of 2015, only an estimated 38% of the game’s players were female, according to one of Magic’s designers. But arguably much of that was due to the self-reinforcing habits of male players who would scoff at any girl who could possibly try to compete against them. How many of the 15-year-old girls whom Vance wrote off as having no interest would have been interested in learning how to play alongside him? It’s only relatively recently that the game’s owner, Wizards of the Coast, itself a subsidiary of Hasbro, has realized how much of the population was being excluded from playing (and buying cards) thanks to the perceived gender norms around the game. Since then, it has moved to eliminate the sexist art that was the norm for the cards’ illustrations and tried to make the game feel more inclusive overall. It’s a shift that of course drew some backlash from the JD Vances of the world. Beyond this specific issue, I’d argue that Vance is bad at being a nerd, given how deeply he has clearly missed the point of “The Lord of the Rings.” J.R.R. Tolkien’s seminal work was born in part out of his view of the horrors of World War I. It stresses the need for fellowship among different groups against the forces of evil and a rejection of the desire for ultimate power. As The New York Times’ David French and Jamelle Bouie have separately noted, there’s little evidence that those messages sunk in with Vance. Vance shares that obliviousness with his benefactor, billionaire Peter Thiel, who made his fortune as an early investor in PayPal. After all, Thiel named his giant data analytics company Palantir after the all-seeing orbs that the villains use to spy on the heroes in “The Lord of the Rings.” As a reference, that’s a deep enough cut to really show off one’s geek credentials while displaying exactly zero comprehension about why Thiel’s pursuit of military contracts would be something that the story’s protagonists would frown upon. We can see this determination to miss the values for the merchandise among many branches of nerd culture. Recently, a post on Reddit’s r/Conservative message board detailed how a group of “Star Trek” fans were appalled to hear politics brought up at a Las Vegas convention. It’s truly a mystery as to how these supposed fans missed the very transparent left-wing tilt throughout the “Trek” franchise, which is set in a post-capitalist utopia where diversity is the greatest of strengths. Along with this purposeful blindness comes the lack of recognition from Vance and those like him that the nerds have won. Geek culture has become a pop culture Goliath. The most popular franchises in the world have realized that it matters that everyone gets to see themselves in the stories being told. For Vance and others, it’s not their interests in comic books or sci-fi that sets them apart now. What’s weird is their refusal to share that win with anyone who doesn’t fit the outdated stereotype of who and what a nerd is. Considering who Vance has become, it’s easy to clock the kind of nerd he once was. Over the last eight years, he’s transformed himself from someone who correctly saw Trump as a threat to the country into Trump’s potential vice president. Much like with Magic, he has opted to drop his morals like a bad habit, showing that he’s more than willing to shift and change himself to try to fit in with his chosen in-group. In doing so, he’s shown himself to be the kind of nerd who has chosen to punch down out of fear of being punched himself."
Elon Musk sues his critics into silence. So much for ‘free speech.’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-x-advertisers-lawsuit-social-media-rcna165605,"Elon Musk, self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” is demanding the government infringe on free speech rights. Again. Despite his posturing as a defender of free expression, Musk is one of the nation’s most vexatious litigants against anybody who exercises their First Amendment rights in a way he doesn’t like. His latest target is GARM, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an industry association of advertisers on online platforms of which X, formerly known as Twitter, is still a member. The lawsuit also targets several of GARM’s members for the supposed crime of declining to purchase ads on Musk’s website. X’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, posted a video on Tuesday explaining that the suit is part of the company’s noble pursuit of preserving “the global town square … the one place that you can express yourself freely and openly.” Yaccarino wore a pendant around her neck that read “FREE SPEECH.” On Thursday, GARM, citing its inability to handle legal fees that would likely run into the seven figures, simply shut its doors, ending all operations. Musk’s censorial bullying worked — abusing the legal system to shut down his critics. Musk’s argument against GARM fits a long-running pattern for him: attacks on free speech wrapped in the rhetoric of defending free speech. Major corporations generally do not want to pay for ads running next to posts praising Adolf Hitler, among other noxious content that has flourished on X under Musk’s ownership. It’s hardly an unreasonable position, and GARM worked to promulgate shared standards companies can adopt for this type of brand safety. This, Musk alleges, amounted to a violation of antitrust laws. Deciding where to purchase ads is an exercise of core free speech and free association rights for any individual or organization. Boycotting X because it’s overrun with hate speech is no different from a conservative advocacy group declining to pay for ads on a progressive podcast. It’s also a case of business judgment for for-profit corporations. PetSmart might well choose to buy magazine ads in Cat Fancy rather than Cigar Aficionado, for example. It’s the latest in a long line of Musk lawsuits seeking to silence his critics, a tactic known as a strategic lawsuit against public participation, or SLAPP. He’s also sued Media Matters for documenting how X fails to keep ads from large corporations away from extremist content. In the same vein, he’s gone after the Center for Countering Digital Hate. He also endorsed the patently absurd criminal investigations into Media Matters launched by the Republican attorneys general of Texas and Missouri, already enjoined by a federal court as the obvious First Amendment violations they are. Sometimes Musk’s interest in promoting censorship extends beyond his own critics, such as when he agreed to pay the legal fees of a Canadian anti-vaxxer who had sued a wide range of people for being mean to her. For many years, actual free speech advocates have been pushing for anti-SLAPP laws, which make it easier to promptly dismiss and receive legal fees for litigation targeting constitutionally protected speech. Texas and California among other states have adopted these robust protections. Unfortunately, there is no national anti-SLAPP law for lawsuits based on federal law claims, such as Musk’s antitrust theory. Federal circuit courts are also divided on whether state anti-SLAPP laws can apply even to state law claims, such as defamation, being heard in federal court under interstate diversity jurisdiction. In the meantime, Musk’s anti-speech lawfare has its intended effect even when it could never plausibly reach a final decision in his favor. In addition to shutting down GARM, Media Matters recently laid off several employees, too, with many observers pointing to Musk’s litigation as a likely contributor. This is the defining feature of SLAPP strategy: process as punishment, ruining targets with the expense of fighting a case even when it lacks any legal merit. The tactic can be particularly effective aimed at nonprofits and individuals, whose relatively modest budgets simply cannot handle a protracted court battle with one of the world’s richest men. Beyond simply being a rich and powerful bully who can waste his own money on vexatious, performative litigation, Musk’s theory of “free speech” is a censorship wolf in sheep’s clothing. He and those he agrees with should be free to speak their minds, the thinking goes, but nobody else should be allowed to criticize or disassociate from them in response. If it falls under nebulous labels like “cancel culture” or the “woke mind virus,” your speech is actually bad for speech and so shouldn’t be allowed. It’s unabashedly statist in its eagerness to use and abuse government power to police the discourse. Musk is free to run his own website however he wants, as he should be. But his claims to be a champion of free speech are a hypocritical farce. In reality, he is one of the biggest enemies of the First Amendment, and should be recognized as such."
Joe Rogan broke MAGA world’s heart with his RFK Jr. support,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 4:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-joe-rogan-rfk-jr-maga-rcna166033,"Joe Rogan’s praise of independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. had Trump supporters up in arms on Thursday. Rogan’s far-right-friendly podcast, his peddling of outlandish conspiracy theories, and his alignment with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (an unmistakably pro-Trump organization) appear to have led some Trump supporters to believe Rogan would ultimately throw his support fully behind former President Donald Trump.  But when video surfaced of Rogan gushing over Kennedy and calling him “the only [candidate] that makes sense to me,"" popular voices among the MAGA faithful were quite unhappy.  The petulant kvetching from several prominent figures in the MAGA movement channeled the widespread rage at Rogan for what apparently felt like a betrayal.  Check out some examples of the morose MAGA reactions from far-right influencer Philip Buchanan (also known as Catturd), as well as right-wing conspiracy theorists Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich.  Facing backlash, Rogan sent out a tweet on Friday praising Trump and claiming his remarks about Kennedy being the only candidate that makes sense weren't really an endorsement. That doesn't seem to have satisfied Trump, who targeted Rogan on his social media platform. “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC ring,” Trump posted from his Truth Social account.  Many conservatives were all-in on the idea of Kennedy’s campaign when he was running as a Democrat, because Kennedy's campaign was initially perceived as capable of helping Trump win by peeling off voters from what was then the Biden-Harris campaign. Kennedy, who was reportedly convinced to run for president by Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and whose campaign is largely being funded by uber-rich Trump-supporter Timothy Mellon, was effectively running an ostensibly liberal campaign with MAGA DNA. But ever since Kennedy decided to run as an independent instead — and as data show he’s likely to pull more voters from Trump than from Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election — Republicans, including Donald Trump himself, have turned their ire on Kennedy and any MAGA-friendly figures who might back him."
Trump’s hopes in Arizona could be dimming. Here’s why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 3:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-arizona-2024-election-harris-rcna166027,"Momentum appears to be swinging in favor of Kamala Harris’ campaign in the Grand Canyon State. Although I’m not one who places a whole lot of stake in poll numbers, some of the recent numbers in Arizona have been favorable to the Democratic nominee. But there are other signs that Donald Trump’s electoral prospects could be dimming in the desert. One piece of evidence is the budding Republican support for Harris. John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, recently endorsed the Harris campaign and agreed to co-chair an advisory committee for the national “Republicans for Harris” effort. Giles’ endorsement underscores two things in particular. First, it speaks to Arizona’s trend toward Democrats over the past decade. For instance, Mesa has gone from one of the most conservative cities in the country to one with more liberal leanings. And the endorsement also shows that a strain of anti-Trump conservatism remains in Arizona, where Trump’s attacks on the late Sen. John McCain have undermined his standing with some Republicans in the state. Senate candidate Kari Lake, another high-profile Republican on the Arizona ballot this fall, has garnered intraparty backlash herself for her attacks on McCain and fellow Republicans. Many in Lake’s own party are backing her Democratic opponent, Ruben Gallego. In fact, she might even be a drag on Trump’s election chances. And on top of that, on Friday, the Harris campaign received a historic endorsement from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy group for Latinos. That could prove very helpful in Arizona, where Latinos make up about a third of the population. Recent data on Latino voters indicates that Harris is attracting and energizing these voters in Arizona — where Latinos were vital in helping Joe Biden flip the state in 2020 — and other battleground states. Trump’s campaign and its surrogates have sought to make gains with Latino voters — albeit in some rather dubious ways. But if Harris is able to maintain the Latino support Biden received in 2020, or even expand it, that could prove calamitous for Trump’s electoral hopes in Arizona. Beyond that, Arizona residents will be voting on a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. With voters in other states siding with abortion-rights supporters on similar measures in recent years, this could create yet another hurdle for Trump in Arizona. None of this means Trump can’t win the Grand Canyon State. But he certainly hasn’t made it easy on himself."

There are no trans women athletes at the Paris Olympics. So bigots manufactured them.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 11:22 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 9, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/olympics-boxer-imane-khelif-anti-trans-rcna164721,"UPDATE (August 9, 2023 05:30 p.m. E.T.): Imane Khelif won welterweight gold on Friday, defeating China's Yang Liu in a unanimous decision. Lin Yu-Ting faces Poland’s Julia Szeremeta in the featherweight gold medal bout Saturday. There are no trans women at this year’s Olympics. There are two nonbinary athletes competing in their assigned sex at birth category, but no trans women. Years of anti-trans activists and conservatives openly raging at any sporting organization that even hinted at including trans women in women’s sports succeeded in killing the Olympic dream for any trans kids watching this year’s Games. But none of that was enough for the internet transphobe brigade as the first week of the Olympics unfolded. First they noticed a woman with a very strong jawline on the American rugby team that took bronze in dramatic fashion Tuesday and incorrectly assumed she was trans. Next it was Facebook users reviving claims American swimming legend Katie Ledecky is trans, because of her shoulder width and musculature. And since Thursday, the internet transvestigators have honed in on  two boxers who — again — are not trans.  After Italy’s Angela Carini quit 46 seconds into her fight against Algeria’s Imane Khelif, conservative politicians, including former President Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, and other anti-trans voices such as author JK Rowling and YouTuber Logan Paul took to social media Thursday to accuse Khelif of being a man. The rumor mill over Khelif ran wild, ranging from people claiming she was a trans woman, to others who claimed she’s just a cis man who hasn’t even transitioned and just wants to cheat. Similar accusations were levied against Khelif’s fellow boxer Lin Yu‑ting of Taiwan. The true story is, of course, much more complex than can be explained clearly in a handful of rage tweets. Both Khelif and Lin were born as women. They have always identified as women. And for years they competed in women’s boxing, including at multiple world championships and the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics. Both have posted numerous losses to cis women in their careers.  The anti-trans fury stems from last year’s world championships, when the International Boxing Association disqualified both boxers for failing “to meet eligibility rules.” IBA president Umar Kremlev claimed at the time that Khelif and Lin were “proven they have XY chromosomes.” But the circumstances around that claim are hugely suspicious. The IBA, the Russian-led organization that suspended her, has actually itself been suspended by the International Olympic Committee over rampant governance problems and corruption issues. Kremlev, who is Russian, made his comments to a Russian news outlet after Khelif defeated a Russian boxer. IBA officials never released details of the method or results of the gender tests. Following the World Championships, Taiwan’s sports administration conducted their own tests and confirmed Lin’s eligibility for international competition. “We have no knowledge of what the tests were,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams told The Washington Post. “They were cobbled together, as I understand, overnight [during the world championships] to change the results.” Yet a lone, unverified claim, along with the boxers’ short hair, has led to masses of online anti-trans activists hurling abuse at two women simply for pursuing their Olympic dreams. Even some journalists like the Guardian’s Sean Ingle have called attention to the Italian boxer’s suffering and demanded explanations from the IOC. But according to The Associated Press, Carini “said she wasn’t making a political statement and was not refusing to fight Khelif.” This whole “controversy” shows how far the anti-trans movement will push in its pursuit to stamp out gender nonconformity from society. It already pushed trans women out of sports. Now it is going after anyone with a strong jaw or a muscular physique. What’s next? Are women with elevated testosterone levels (which can arise from diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome) going to be declared men? Where does it end? It’s truly a shame that so many people have attacked Khelif’s gender when her true story is one of inspiration. As a kid, she wanted to learn how to box, but her father forbade it, telling her that the sport was “not for girls.” Now she is competing at the Olympics. Yet even self-proclaimed feminists like Rowling want to ban her from boxing like Khelif’s father once did. Every day, it seems, anti-trans voices narrow who counts as a “real woman” in sports, in bathrooms and in life. Their fury and gender obsession come at the expense of women and girls who suddenly find themselves excluded from an increasingly restricted definition of womanhood. How much further must we bend to these ideologues? They succeeded in killing the Olympic dream for trans children everywhere. Now they want to push out women who do not meet their arbitrary standard of womanhood. Society has no need for gender police. It’s time we say, “no more.”"
"Why pro-Palestinian protesters are going after Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 2:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-gaza-israel-protests-obama-dreamers-rcna166006,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight,” guest hosted by Ali Velshi. The last time Democrats sought to hold onto the White House after four years in power was in 2012, when then-President Barack Obama was running against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Romney was not the most conservative candidate in the Republican Party, even back then. But he had staked out an aggressive hard-right position on the issue of immigration, running on a platform of “self-deportation” — making life so hard for immigrants in this country that they have no choice but to leave. Given that, it probably surprised a lot of people that young undocumented immigrants had chosen to spend their time and energy protesting … President Obama. They held mass demonstrations outside the White House where many were arrested. They showed up at his campaign offices in California, carrying signs that read, “Obama stop deporting Dreamers.” Protesters even held a hunger strike sit-in at Obama’s campaign offices in the then-swing state of Colorado. At issue were protections for Dreamers, people who were brought to this country without legal authorization as children, many of whom had lived in the U.S. almost their entire lives. Obama supported protections for those Dreamers, but he insisted that he could not grant them those protections alone. He said the Republican-controlled Congress would have to send him a bill. But then, in June of 2012, right in the middle of the campaign, something remarkable happened: Obama came around and decided to try. He announced that he would grant protection to thousands of Dreamers through executive order.  The pressure worked and Obama was re-elected with strong support from the Latino community, despite the protests. However, much to the chagrin of the Obama administration, the protests didn’t stop. Many of those Dreamers were now protected, but there were still some who weren’t. And the parents of those Dreamers could still be deported at any moment. So those activists kept pushing, even interrupting the president during speaking events. Obama, again, insisted that he did not have the power to take those actions alone. But activists kept the pressure on. The following year, Obama moved again, using another executive order to shield even more Dreamers from deportation and deprioritize the deportation of people without criminal records. There were plenty of people at the time who questioned the strategy of those protesters, who asked why they weren’t protesting Romney and the Republicans in Congress who were blocking progress on immigration reform; but those protesters understood a key part of how social movements work. They understood that sometimes in order to make real change you have to target the people who are moveable, the people who want you in their coalition, the people who actually care. That is both the burden and the beauty of what it means to be part of a functioning, big-tent political party that's responsive to social change — to be on the side of what the late Rep. John Lewis called “good trouble.” On Wednesday, at a rally in Detroit, Vice President Kamala Harris was interrupted by a group of demonstrators protesting the war in Gaza. After their second interruption, Harris shut down the protesters, telling them, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” That’s a snappy line that makes for a good soundbite and it’s undeniably true that she will be a better president for their cause than Donald Trump. But, as those immigration protesters proved back in the Obama administration, these issues are more complicated than “we’re better for you than the other guys.” Harris has already proven she is the kind of thoughtful leader who listens and that she understands the nuance of this particular issue, even while some continue to insist that neither nuance nor context matters on this story. Her campaign presents a real opportunity to reset the relationship with the varied communities expressing dissatisfaction over this war, and America’s role in it. But will the Harris campaign use this as an opportunity to listen? And can those protesters use this as an opportunity to be heard?

Mike Lindell company must pay attorney fees in 'Prove Mike Wrong' case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 1:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/lindell-mypillow-attorney-fees-prove-mike-wrong-rcna166007,"In the latest legal development for conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell, his company was ordered to pay attorney’s fees in the fallout from litigation over his challenge to disprove his 2020 election fraud claim. Back in February, a federal judge approved a $5 million award against Lindell’s company in the so-called Prove Mike Wrong challenge. Lindell Management LLC had hosted a cyber symposium in which a participant could win $5 million if they proved that certain data Lindell had wasn’t valid election data. Robert Zeidman effectively succeeded in that task, and a federal judge ordered the award to be paid. Lindell Management has filed an appeal seeking to vacate the award. Meanwhile, a federal magistrate judge on Thursday ordered the company to pay another, much smaller amount. The latest litigation concerned Zeidman’s request for attorney’s fees connected with bringing a motion to compel responses during discovery. Zeidman sought $12,800, but the court found he was entitled to $4,508, with the judge applying a lower hourly rate than Zeidman requested and noting that his discovery requests were overbroad and contributed to the costs he incurred. Though it pales in comparison to the millions Lindell’s company was ordered to pay in the challenge loss, the MyPillow CEO may nonetheless appreciate the judge’s scrutiny of the fee award, especially if he loses his appeal.

MAGA influencers say Trump is on track to lose the election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 1:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-election-laura-loomer-nick-fuentes-maga-rcna166003,"Concerned about Donald Trump’s prospects of winning the presidential election, some right-wing influencers are lashing out over what they feel has been a weak campaign. Laura Loomer, a bigoted conspiracy theorist and social media troll whom Trump has praised repeatedly, sounded the alarm on X on Thursday. “President Trump needs to make some serious changes in his campaign ASAP,” she wrote in part. “The ground game is not sufficient. “The offense is lacking. “The communication is dismal. “The momentum is crashing. “Why are people who want to assist being pushed away instead of being embraced?” I don’t know precisely what Loomer means about people who want to assist being pushed away, though her outlandish behavior has, at times, made her a tad too toxic for some Trump supporters to associate with. Lately, however, Trump has had no problem sharing her bigoted, baseless attacks concerning Kamala Harris’ biracial identity, as he and other conservatives have falsely questioned the vice president’s Blackness. In the replies and quote tweets on Loomer’s post about Trump’s ground game, there was some pushback. But a number of popular MAGA enthusiasts were in agreement with her. That includes white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who wrote on X that his former dinner mate’s campaign is in a “death spiral” and listed his grievances. In the comments replying to his post, Fuentes faced a deluge of angry backlash. More criticism came from popular conservative pundit John Cardillo, who claimed on X that far-right activist group Turning Point USA and other pro-Trump groups are out of their depth. “Guys, we do not have a ground game,” he wrote in part. “Outsourcing that most critical function to TPUSA Action and two other untested PACs are not the actions of a campaign serious about winning. “Frankly, it’s insane.” Predictably, Cardillo faced blowback from TPUSA members and affiliates, who insisted that their efforts to help Trump have been moving swimmingly along. We’ll know in just a few months. But for the time being, there’s clearly discontent and division in MAGA world, with many Trump supporters worried about a campaign they think is primed to lose."
Why isn’t Donald Trump spending more time on the campaign trail?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 12:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/isnt-donald-trump-spending-time-campaign-trail-rcna166022,"While his criminal trial unfolded in May, Donald Trump routinely complained that the legal proceedings represented “election interference.” To back up his rhetoric, the former president had a habit of telling reporters, “I’d like to be campaigning.” As the argument went, the Republican candidate wanted to be on the campaign trail — holding rallies, meeting voters, attending fundraisers, doing photo-ops, etc. — and the fact that he was stuck in a criminal courtroom a few days per week was interfering with his electoral opportunities. There were, however, a couple of glaring problems with the claim. For one thing, criminal proceedings aren’t simply put on indefinite hold when a defendant seeks elected office. For another, there were plenty of off-days in the trial, when Trump could’ve held campaign events. He didn’t bother. Three months later, the trial has run its course — a jury found the Republican guilty of 34 felonies — and the GOP nominee still isn’t maintaining much of a campaign schedule. CNBC reported: In August 2016, the then-candidate held 27 campaign rallies across 15 states. As August 2024 gets underway, Trump has held one event so far, and over the last six weeks, he’s only held eight. The Washington Post ran a related analysis, further documenting just how much the Republican candidate has slowed his schedule down this year. Asked at his meandering press conference about his light schedule, the former president called it a “stupid question,” before adding that he doesn’t believe he has to campaign to win. “I’m leading by a lot,” Trump said. The problem, of course, is that the line of inquiry wasn’t stupid — and he isn’t leading by a lot. The result is a good question for which there is no obvious answer: Why isn’t Trump campaigning more? Perhaps he has no idea how competitive the 2024 race has become. Maybe he’s become lazier. Perhaps he’s come to believe holding campaign events doesn’t help much. Maybe there’s an undisclosed health issue. It’s impossible to say for sure from a distance. Whatever the explanation, Trump’s next campaign event is in Montana — which is nowhere near a battleground state — not because he’s trying to give his campaign a boost, but because of a personal vendetta against a Democratic senator who bothered him six years ago. It’s quite a strategy."
Tim Walz deserves better than Team Trump's 'stolen valor' smears,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 12:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-military-record-vance-trump-stolen-valor-rcna165978,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of the finest people I’ve known in politics. He’s a leader of integrity, honor, humility and fight. He’s also a veteran who cares deeply about the well-being of his fellow veterans. Which is why it’s enraging and sad to watch Ohio senator and fellow veteran JD Vance and Team Trump attempt to smear his military record and accuse him of “stolen valor.” “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him — a fact that he’s been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,” Vance, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday. The truth is that Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and retired honorably before his run for Congress in 2005. As an artilleryman, Walz “served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and was the highest-ranking enlisted National Guard Soldier in southern Minnesota when he retired from 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery in 2005,” according to the U.S. Army. Building on this experience, Walz has dedicated his political career to helping other veterans. As the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, veterans had no finer and more tenacious advocate than Walz. Every veteran service organization and veteran leader knows he is one of our own, and that we could always count on him. He knows how to get things done in Washington and for his communities. And he always has our back, from the new GI Bill expansion way back in 2008 to the Clay Hunt SAV Act in 2016 to countless fights in between.  The Democrats had to pick a veteran. And they picked one whom everyone knows, respects and trusts. (And one Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other key party leaders know, respect and trust.) Walz is a patriotic, down to earth and lovable bulldog.  If the Democrats weren’t going to pick a Republican or true independent — or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly — I believe Walz is their best chance to win. Pew research from 2022 showed “about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners (66%) say they like political leaders who have military experience,” with men generally more likely to regard military service as a positive.  Walz still embodies the spirit of his high school football coaching career. He knows how to spot talent, support teammates, make people better, rally diverse groups and encourage a team to victory. And he’s a fighter. Especially in hard times.  The loss of his brother Craig in 2016 was an unthinkable tragedy. But Walz rallied his family through it — like he can rally our country through all this pain and uncertainty now. He understands suffering, he understands working people, he understands national security, he understands America.  And he understands how to punch back. He’s also more liberal than me (and plenty of other Americans), and that will surely challenge him with independents and moderates. And with Walz and Harris together, the Democrats are going to have to fight incredibly hard to show they’re more moderate than the narrative suggests.  Republicans are already weaponizing the fact that Walz was Sen. Bernie Sanders’ preferred pick.  And now, they’re pulling one of their oldest, nastiest and most effective plays out of the playbook, by attacking Walz’s service.  The Harris-Walz campaign was clearly not ready for the Swift boat attacks — but they were entirely predictable. Details, military records and validators who know Walz and the truth should have been buttoned up in advance, ready at the announcement, and shared with the public and media. Unfortunately, they were not.  This is an unnecessary communications and strategy failure, and a reflection of a deeper lack of military and veterans cultural competency in the Democratic Party. This problem also exists in the GOP (to a lesser degree) and indeed all across our society. And it is an important reminder that we need more veterans across the political, media, education and business ecosystem. But the lack of representation — and resulting ignorance — is especially painful in politics. Just ask former Sens. Jim Webb (Virginia) or Bob Kerrey (Nebraska).  The Trump campaign hired Chris LaCivita — a longtime political operative who led the “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” back in 2004 and helped sink Vietnam veteran John Kerry’s campaign — months ago. There’s no reason why Democrats should have been caught flat-footed this time around. Indeed, whether the Swift boat attacks are fair or not, the Harris-Walz campaign should have been more prepared for battle. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Now the campaign (and Walz himself), need to get a plan together, be transparent, clear and forceful, and make up the ground lost. And, where they can, counterattack smartly. This is the first battle of its kind for this new Democratic ticket. But it definitely won’t be the last. Every vote and foot of political ground taken is critical to victory. Especially with veterans — and especially with independent veterans in swing states.  I’d like to live in an America where nobody attacks a veteran's service or tries to compare one term of service to another. Every person who volunteers to wear the uniform has done something for our country that 99% of the public has not. And that should be respected — whether they’re a Navy SEAL hunting Osama Bin Laden or a cook making breakfast for other troops stateside at Fort Liberty. Service to our country is honorable. And one of the most dangerous jobs in America, whether you’re combat deployed or training back home.  But we live in this America. And no matter what anyone says, Tim Walz is incredibly sincere, hard-working, tough and likable. He’s a leader of integrity and character. He’s the opposite of ""weird."" And, yes, he’s funny.  He will change some hearts and minds. Hopefully, enough to beat Trump.  I’m just one veteran. But I’m rooting for him."
"On abortion rights, Trump keeps creating opportunities for Dems",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 12:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/abortion-rights-trump-keeps-creating-opportunities-dems-rcna166008,"In the spring, Donald Trump raised a few eyebrows by confirming — out loud, on camera, and on the record — that he was “looking at” possible restrictions on contraception. The former president eventually walked that back, but not before he created an opportunity that Democrats are already exploiting. In the summer, he’s doing it again. At his long, meandering press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump began by assuring the public that voters don’t much care about reproductive rights — a line Republicans have clung to in recent years, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary — before lying about the Democratic agenda in deeply ugly ways. All of which set the stage for the pièce de resistance. NBC News reported: The GOP nominee went on to argue that there are “many things on a humane basis that you can do outside of that.” The audio in the clip isn’t great, but NBC News’ Garrett Haake posted a written transcript of the exchange online, which reinforces the fact that Trump didn’t appear to have any idea what he was talking about. In fact, all things considered, it’s reasonable to wonder whether the former president has any idea what mifepristone is. For those unfamiliar with the medication — a group that apparently includes the Republican nominee — the FDA approved it nearly a quarter of a century ago, to be used as part of a two-step process to terminate unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks. The drug has proven to be safe, effective, and commonly used. A notorious Trump-appointed judge in Texas curtailed access to the drug, though he was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Nevertheless, many on the right still harbor hopes that the Republican, in a second term, might enforce the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of drugs used for abortions by mail. Indeed, all of this is part of the right-wing Project 2025 agenda, written in large part by members of Team Trump. It was against this backdrop that the GOP candidate left the door wide open to revoking access to the medication during the Q&A at Mar-a-Lago. Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez wasted little time in seizing on the comments from the press conference. “Already, women across the country are suffering because of the nightmare Donald Trump unleashed by overturning Roe v. Wade,” she said. “That reality — women forced to the brink of death before receiving the care they need, doctors facing the threat of jail time for doing their jobs, and survivors of rape and incest made to flee their states for basic health care — will only get worse if Donald Trump wins and wipes out access to medication abortion.”"
Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat appeals weight disqualification ahead of gold medal match,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 11:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/vinesh-phogat-appeal-disqualified-weight-olympics-rcna165964,"Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat just barely failed to make weight ahead of what was set to be her Olympic finals match on Wednesday against American wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt. Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Phogat beat in the semifinal the day before, took Phogat’s place in the 50-kilogram final, and Hildebrandt won the gold — the second for U.S. women wrestlers in as many days. While it was a great feat for Hildebrandt and the U.S. team, it was devastating for Phogat and her many supporters. As NBC News reported, she’s known for her “impassioned activism against sexual harassment in her sport, including making major allegations against the former president of the Wrestling Federation of India.” Phogat then announced her retirement, writing on social media (in a translation from Hindi by Reuters) that her “dreams are shattered. I don’t have any more strength.” Now, you might be wondering: Why are you reading this dramatic wrestling story on a legal blog? That’s because the story might not be over: It’s now a legal one of sorts. Phogat has pleaded her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an institution headquartered in Switzerland with an ad hoc division set up in Paris for the games. On Friday, the court noted that Phogat had filed an application with the tribunal, challenging United World Wrestling’s decision to replace her in the gold medal match. She wants to be awarded a (shared) silver medal.  There are separate weigh-ins for each day of wrestling, so Phogat had made the weight cut-off in her matches leading up to the finals. She reportedly only missed the weight on Wednesday by 100 grams — about a fifth of a pound. Sports Illustrated reported that “she was not only disqualified from the match against Hildebrandt but also had her previous victories in the tournament nullified.” Phogat’s path to success in her challenge is unclear because the UWW's wrestling rules state: “If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of [sic] the competition and ranked last, without rank.” The sports court said the matter has been referred to an arbitrator to hold a hearing with the parties on Friday, with a decision expected before the end of the Olympic Games on Sunday.

Jack Smith seeks more time for planning after immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 8:25 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 9, 2024, 10:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-trump-delay-chutkan-immunity-rcna165928,"UPDATE (Aug. 9, 2024, 1:18 p.m. ET): On Friday, Judge Tanya Chutkan granted special counsel Jack Smith's request for a time extension to file a joint status report in Donald Trump's federal election interference case. The report is now due Aug. 30 and a status conference is set for Sept. 5, Chutkan said. A hallmark of Donald Trump’s litigation strategy has been delay. Now special counsel Jack Smith wants more time in the federal election interference case, though not for the purpose of dragging it out. In a joint filing on Thursday from Smith and Trump’s lawyers, the special counsel told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that prosecutors are still assessing the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling in Trump v. United States, including by consulting with other components of the Justice Department. “Although those consultations are well underway, the Government has not finalized its position on the most appropriate schedule for the parties to brief issues related to the decision,” according to the filing, called a “joint status report.” Smith asked Chutkan for “additional time to provide the Court with an informed proposal regarding the schedule for pretrial proceedings moving forward.” Chutkan had asked the parties for the proposal to determine how to proceed after the case returned to her following the Supreme Court's July 1 immunity ruling. She had also set a status conference for Aug. 16. In Thursday’s filing, Smith asked Chutkan for an extension to submit another joint report by Aug. 30, and to hold the previously scheduled Aug. 16 conference at some point after that. Unsurprisingly, the filing noted that Trump “does not object to the Government’s request for an extension.” So, what’s going on here? It’s not fully clear from the filing, which (unsurprisingly) didn’t detail the DOJ’s deliberations or the extent to which there is disagreement within the department over how to move forward. To be sure, the Supreme Court’s new test for determining what may be immune from prosecution is cryptic enough that it could prompt different interpretations and prosecutorial strategies. The forthcoming filing on the government’s position may provide more insight into the matter. At any rate, pushing the proposal back a few weeks won’t make the difference in whether a trial happens before the election. The timing and substance of the Supreme Court ruling has already made that impracticable. The real question now isn’t whether a trial happens before the presidential election but, in the near term, whether Trump wins that election, in which case he can crush the prosecution himself. If he loses, then the question is what will be left of the case after the high court ruling that at least narrows the prosecution. That’s not an excuse for the government being unprepared with its position about how to proceed, but it’s a reality hovering over the case no matter what Smith’s eventual position is. The bottom line for now is that, since there won’t be a pre-election trial, it’s difficult to see this development as a meaningful delay in the grand scheme of things. That delay has already occurred. The next move is up to Chutkan to decide whether to accept the request. If she does, then there won’t be significant movement in the case before September. As it happens, that’s when Judge Juan Merchan is expected to rule on the immunity decision’s effect on Trump’s guilty verdicts in New York and to sentence him that month if he finds that the immunity ruling doesn’t stand in the way. So the next big filing in Trump’s cases could be Smith’s brief due later this month to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the dismissal of Trump’s federal classified documents case, whose fate, like the federal election interference case, is also partly tied to the presidential election outcome.

Donald Trump and JD Vance are failing America's favorite political test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 10:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-vance-harris-walz-beer-question-rcna165834,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""The Reid Out."" Let’s talk about joy — no not me, Joy, but the feeling of joy. More specifically, the joy being felt by Americans backing the Harris-Walz ticket. A joy that is palpable and pervasive.  We saw that joy on full display, with massive crowds greeting Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at their rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday. It feels like we are experiencing another 2008 Obama moment. The energy, the excitement, the enthusiasm. It feels fun. Imagine that, American politics … joyful again. The 2024 presidential election has quickly become the tale of two tickets: one radiates joy and the other is dour and frankly, frightening. And it’s clear that has Republicans freaking out. Harris has not only been criticized for her race, gender and parental status — but also for laughing. As if an infectious, energizing belly laugh — the literal display of joy — is a bad thing. Walz is also a joyful guy. His former students love him. He was a popular and successful high school football coach. He made “weird” happen. He’s a Midwesterner with “big dad energy” who will offer tips on how to fix your car and save money to boot. Some of you may be familiar with the “beer question” in U.S. politics: a thought experiment often utilized by the media or in polling, which says voters will generally elect the candidate they would rather have a beer with. Victory in American politics often goes not to the candidate who better articulates their platform, but rather, to whoever is more likable. So you be the judge: Who would you rather have a beer with? Harris, who dares to laugh and Walz, the plain-spoken fun uncle who will defend the people he loves? Or Trump, who rambles about sharks and hatred, who makes fun of people and smirks but who rarely laughs, and who doesn’t seem capable of talking to a child — even his own grandkids? And his cat lady-hating sidekick Sen. JD Vance? That guy is really weird. So weird the couch meme won’t die. Vance is basically stalking the Democratic ticket. On Wednesday, he stunned reporters by attempting to confront Harris and Walz on the tarmac when their planes arrived in Wisconsin at similar times.  Vance told reporters he “just wanted to check out [his] future plane.” Walking up to the vice president and Air Force Two is not a thing that normal people do. His weirdness aside, this race has also been a total reversal of how the parties are normally framed. The Republicans love to attack Democratic elites — but this time around, Harris and Walz actually feel like the more regular, normal middle-class folks. Yes, they are living extraordinary political lives but due to hard work, not connections or riches.  Harris went to Howard University, an HBCU, then The University Of California, Hastings College Of Law. Walz attended an open-admissions teachers college in northwest Nebraska. Quite the opposite of the candidates on the Republican side — with Trump-Vance being the Ivy League ticket, loved by the billionaires. It’s a conundrum for the Republican Party. The so-called populist MAGA movement is now bankrolling a celebrity who inherited his wealth, who is not out there campaigning but instead golfing at this exclusive ritzy resort, and a vice presidential candidate anointed by another super weird guy, tech investor Peter Thiel. It’s also a ticket backed by billionaire tech bros who want to unleash Project 2025 — the brainchild of rich people — on the American people.  It is a hateful vision that all people should fear … and it’s a vision reflected perfectly by the two men who want to execute it.

"On Harris’ racial identity, Trump apparently can’t help himself",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 9, 2024, 9:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-racial-identity-trump-apparently-cant-help-rcna165982,"Donald Trump spent much of last week taking aim at Kamala Harris’ racial identity — up to and including the Republican promoting messages related to the Democrat’s birth certificate. The tactics were as racist as they were familiar: Axios described the effort as “Trump’s new birtherism.” Earlier this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who became a sycophantic ally, appeared on Fox News and suggested the party steer clear of comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage ... is a good day for her and a bad day for us,” the South Carolina Republican said. Putting aside the fact that it’s a bad sign when a senator has to publicly appeal to his party’s presidential nominee to be less racist, Graham’s advice appeared sensible. Even Trump’s allies struggled to explain why, exactly, the GOP nominee was investing so much energy into targeting Harris on racial grounds. The former president nevertheless ignored Graham’s recommendation. The New Republic highlighted one of the more memorable exchanges from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago news conference: When a reporter, referencing one of Trump’s comments from last week, specifically asked the former president how it is that Harris only recently decided to be Black, the GOP nominee replied, “You’ll have to ask her that question because she’s the one that said it. I didn’t say it.” As part of the same exchange, Trump went on to argue: “From her standpoint, I think it’s very disrespectful to both, really. Whether it’s Indian or Black, I think it’s very disrespectful to both.” So, a few things. First, the idea that he “didn’t say” that Harris recently decided to be Black is the opposite of the truth. Appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention last week, Trump said — out loud, on the record and on camera — “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Is she Indian, or is she Black?” Second, the idea that a biracial person is being “disrespectful” by honoring their mother’s and father’s heritage is every bit as offensive as it seems. Finally, spare a thought for the Trump sycophants who’ve tried and failed to defend the former president’s fixation on Harris’ race — Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, I’m looking in your direction — only to have the GOP nominee casually stroll back into the racist trap of his own making."
