Americans want SCOTUS reform — but 'arrogant' justices are standing in the way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-supreme-court-reform-ethics-rcna164350,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""Deadline: White House."" On Monday, President Joe Biden announced a slate of new proposals to overhaul the Supreme Court, calling on Congress to establish term limits and a binding code of ethics for the justices. He also asked lawmakers to pass a constitutional amendment to overturn the court's decision allowing sitting presidents immunity from criminal law.  Now I know the chances of these reforms passing or being enshrined in our Constitution anytime soon are not great. But Biden did the right thing. It’s very important that the president put this marker down ahead of November's election. There’s no question the Roberts Court is in a crisis. The American people do not trust it. The justices' ethical lapses have been huge and notable. Most Americans realize there's something wrong with sitting U.S. Supreme Court justices taking all this free stuff from billionaires when everybody else in government has to be very transparent. Committing crimes as president and getting a free get-out-of-jail card is also not acceptable to most Americans. What we're witnessing from the Supreme Court is extreme arrogance. When all of the details of these ethical lapses first came out — the hundreds of thousands of dollars in luxury trips, school tuition, RVs and fishing trips — that would have been a moment for a majority of justices on the court to do a gut check and say it’s time for ethics reform. Instead of doing that, the majority of justices on the bench have told the American people: ""You can’t touch us. Leave us alone."" It’s just arrogant.  It's also infuriating for people like myself, who have served in government and been subject to ethics rules. Almost everyone in government has to abide by ethics rules. It is part of our democracy and has been for a long time. Ethics rules for judges who aren’t Supreme Court judges are tough. Same for members of Congress. If you’re a member of Congress. you can’t even go out to dinner with someone — you have to stand up and eat only hors d’oeuvres for it to qualify under the ethics rule.  Proposals like term limits have always been popular with voters, no matter who they are for. Republicans backing away from reform simply because the court is on their side right now is not a good look. Even if these proposals aren't implemented, I think this could be a winning issue for Democrats at the ballot box.

"Sheriff who hired Sean Grayson, the deputy who killed Sonya Massey, rejects calls to resign",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 2:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sean-grayson-sonya-massey-sheriff-resign-rcna164296,"The Illinois sheriff who hired Sean Grayson, the deputy who killed Sonya Massey in her home, has asked for “forgiveness” from the community over her death but rejected calls for his resignation. “We failed Sonya. We failed Sonya’s family and friends. We failed the community,” Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell told residents in Springfield on Monday night. “I stand here today before you, with arms wide open, and I ask for your forgiveness. I ask Ms. Massey and her family for forgiveness.” Campbell was speaking at a listening session organized by the U.S. Justice Department, which is investigating Massey's death. Grayson, who is white, shot and killed Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, in her home on July 6 after she called 911 to report a suspected prowler. It was the first time that Campbell has addressed the public in person since Massey's killing. Yet the sheriff maintained that he would not step down. ""You are the reason I ran for sheriff,"" he told residents on Monday. ""My commitment to you has never wavered. It still doesn't. I cannot step down. I will not abandon the sheriff's office at a most critical moment. That would solve nothing; the incident would remain. I vow to listen and learn."" Grayson was hired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office in May 2023 — his sixth job at a law enforcement agency since 2020. He was fired on July 17, nearly two weeks after he killed Massey. Massey's family members have questioned why the sheriff’s office hired Grayson in the first place, given his history of disciplinary problems and red flags at law enforcement agencies where he previously worked. It's unclear whether Campbell or any other Sangamon County officials were aware of Grayson's performance issues at his previous jobs, NBC News reported. However, the sheriff's office said it was aware of his misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence in two separate prior incidents. Grayson has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in Massey's death. His attorney, Dan Fultz, declined to comment about his history of disciplinary issues."
R. Kelly appeals sex crime convictions to U.S. Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 1:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/r-kelly-supreme-court-appeal-rcna164313,"R. Kelly is appealing his federal sex crimes convictions to the Supreme Court, pressing a statute of limitations argument that an appeals court flatly rejected. The disgraced singer’s appeal stems from his conviction in Chicago for producing child pornography and enticing minors to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to 20 years. (In another case in New York that’s under a separate pending appeal, he was sentenced to 30 years, though 19 years of the two sentences are set to be served concurrently.) The 57-year-old, named Robert Sylvester Kelly, is currently slated to be released from prison in 2045.  In his petition to the justices, Kelly’s lawyers argue that he was wrongly prosecuted retroactively under a federal law that they argue bars charges related to his conduct in the 1990s and early 2000s. Prior to 2003, the statute of limitations barred prosecutions after the victim’s 25th birthday. But the law was amended that year to allow prosecutions through the life of the victim. The victims hadn’t turned 25 by then, but they had by the time that Kelly was charged. That timing is crucial, according to the federal appeals court that rejected Kelly’s claim, leading to his Supreme Court appeal. “As a threshold matter, it is not unconstitutional to apply a newer statute of limitations to old conduct when the defendant was subject to prosecution at the time of the change, as Kelly was in 2003,” the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in April. It takes four justices to grant review of a petition, and the court only takes a small fraction each year of the thousands of appeals it receives. Before the court considers whether to take Kelly’s case, the Justice Department has a chance to oppose his petition in writing, with its response currently due Aug. 28.

I didn’t vote for Tim Walz originally. Now I’m completely Walz-pilled.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 12:33 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 6, 2024, 6:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-pick-minnesota-rcna164157,"UPDATE (Aug. 6, 2024, 9:17 a.m. ET): On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz to be her 2024 running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thinks the leaders of the modern Republican Party — especially but not exclusively former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — are extremely “weird.” He has been saying so for months, but ever since Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, he has become one of her most effective messengers, doing the dirty work of attacking the Republicans so Harris can focus on a positive message — “Freedom.”  It has become easy to imagine Walz as the next Democratic nominee for vice president, one of a handful of politicians who have emerged as front-runners for the honor. If it happens, I’ll be thrilled. I’m a Minnesotan and have watched Walz since he started running for governor in the 2018 election. Before that, he was just a “downstate” congressman and not so much on my radar.  But much to my surprise, I’ve become fully “Walz-pilled,” not so much because of the viral clips, but because when he has had the opportunity, he has done everything he can to make Minnesota a better place for everyone. Frankly, I’m surprised at my own enthusiasm, because I wasn’t a Walz supporter when he ran for governor in 2018. This is inside baseball for Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor politics (not technically the Democratic Party), but Walz came into the race as the more electable, more conservative major candidate for governor. He seemed fine but boring, and it felt like in the coming blue wave anti-Trump election cycle, Minnesota could do better.  So I backed his rival, Erin Murphy, and she lost. I was disappointed but naturally voted for Walz in the general election and was happy enough that he won.  But I thought Walz would be a brake on progress, seeking the kind of consensus across the middle that just isn’t possible these days thanks to the devolution of the Republicans. And the Minnesota GOP seemed especially devolved, nominating far-right ideologues instead of trying to compete in a purple state. Turns out I was wrong. Walz’s first term was fine, marked by generally solid health-related leadership during Covid and some questionable decisions during the 2020 George Floyd uprising, but it was last year that everything changed.  In the 2022 elections, Democrats won a trifecta, taking full control of state government, but with a Senate majority of only one seat. DFL leaders never hesitated, taking advantage of a large budget surplus to quickly enact a wide range of progressive policies across the board that changed our state for the better.  They made Minnesota a safe haven for the trans community. They affirmed abortion as a fundamental right and removed restrictions that limited access. They legalized recreational cannabis use and passed laws for driver’s licenses for all Minnesotans regardless of immigration status, automatic voter registration, paid family and medical leave, tax rebates for people making less than $75,000 and new climate goals, and they phased out parental fees for families with kids on Medicaid. This last one is perhaps narrower than the others, but my son has Down syndrome and is on Medicaid, so I sure paid close attention to this. Tim Walz was just one of the Democratic leaders behind the unprecedented sweep of legislation, and arguably not even the most important. House leader Melissa Hortman and Senate leader Kari Dziedzic led the way, kept their caucuses united and got the bills to Walz’s desk. But he never hesitated and quickly became the public face of the movement, especially when he was signing bills for free lunch for all Minnesota school kids, no exceptions. Long before his name was mentioned in the veepstakes, he went viral for pictures of kids hugging him and then lining up for a high-five line as Walz clowned around in the classroom. I’m less interested in the identity politics surrounding Walz, though I recognize that as a Midwestern white dad, a veteran, a former social studies teacher and football coach and a dad from a small rural town, he has a background very distinguishable from Harris’.  But there’s an advantage to this. He can argue, as he did on MSNBC, that the genuine problems facing small-town white Americans are the fault of plutocrats — the Trumps of the world, venture capitalists like JD Vance and their backers. Because the problem isn’t just that they are weird creeps, but that they’re genuinely making lives worse for more people. Walz believes Democratic policies make lives better. At the end of the 2023 legislative session, Walz gave the memorable quote “Minnesota is showing the country you don’t win elections to bank political capital — you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”  When I heard that, I became entirely Walz-pilled, delighted to be led by a politician drawing from the best Minnesota traditions of “happy warriors” like former Democratic Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey (also a former vice president) and Paul Wellstone. I’m willing to share him with the nation. Too often, including in January 2021, Democrats have held power in Washington and acted too cautiously rather than risen to the moment. The Minnesota model shows there’s another way.  Sure, Republicans howled about the lack of bipartisanship, but that’s one of the lessons. Do one progressive act or do 50, the howl will be the same. And if you help enough people, voters will reward you. There’s some Midwestern dad energy that the nation sorely needs. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign.

"Team Harris stresses prosecutorial record, calls Trump a criminal",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 11:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-harris-prosecutorial-record-calls-trump-criminal-election-2024-rcna164333,"At an event late last week, Donald Trump declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” he said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” In context, Trump appeared to be referring to migrants hoping to enter the United States, but there was a degree of irony hanging overhead. In a little more than a year, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case, a different jury held him liable for sexual abuse, and a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. A little self-awareness goes a long way, and by any reasonable measure, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal” is a phrase the GOP nominee probably ought to avoid. It was against this backdrop that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign made its first big ad buy of the cycle, investing $50 million in support of a spot called “Fearless.” The minute-long commercial is worth watching in its entirety, but of particular interest was the opening message in the spot. “As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,” the narrator tells viewers. “As California’s attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners.” The ad goes on from there, but from the outset, the message was unambiguous: Team Harris wants voters to know about her background in law enforcement, and her role in locking up criminals. A day earlier, the incumbent vice president’s political operation sent a news release to reporters on crime, noting not only the significant improvement in crime rates during the Democratic administration, but also saying plainly: “Our opponent Donald Trump is a criminal.” A campaign spokesperson added, “On crime and the border: Donald Trump’s lies are not facts and Donald Trump’s angry rants are not results. Under Trump, America saw unprecedented violence, ineptitude, and division. Right now, America is stronger and safer because of the work of the Biden-Harris administration: Violent crime is at record lows, the border is more secure, and unlike Donald Trump, the vice president is committed to enforcing the law, not breaking it.” The former president talks about crime as if it’s a campaign issue on which he has an advantage, despite his felonious past. It appears his assumptions are being tested. At a campaign rally last week, Trump told an audience that the Democratic campaign was telling the electorate, “‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’” He added, “I don’t think people are going to buy it.” The trouble, of course, is that the message has the benefit of being true. As for whether voters will buy it or not, we’ll find out in about 98 days."
Project 2025’s plot for a Trump DOJ takeover,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 11:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-doj-fbi-trump-power-rcna164165,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 28 episode of “Velshi.” Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department begins with a bit of a tell: ""Not reforming the Department of Justice will also guarantee the failure of that conservative Administration’s agenda in countless other ways.” A common misconception held by Donald Trump while he was president was that the Justice Department worked for him, not for the American people. Chapter 17 seeks to make that misconception true. Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation and architect of Project 2025, is already on board with Trump’s perspective. In January, he told The New York Times, “[W]e just disagree wholly that the Department of Justice is independent of the president or the executive branch.” Now, Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for a second Trump term isn't an easy read. The words and sentences are deliberately confusing. But make no mistake, Project 2025 calls for a Justice Department working in lockstep with a potential Trump administration. That means if Trump is re-elected, the branch tasked with independently and impartially upholding the rule of law will be in the hands of a man convicted of 34 felony counts, who has promised revenge and retribution against his personal enemies. What could possibly go wrong? Let’s start with Project 2025's plans for the FBI, which is a branch within the Justice Department. While president, Trump was supremely frustrated by his inability to control the FBI. He wanted desperately for the agency to drop its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. So it follows that Project 2025 would encourage the next conservative administration to place the FBI under more “politically accountable” leadership — code words for “loyal to the president.” It also wants the FBI to stop investigating online misinformation, a new initiative that feels more important than ever. The agency wouldn't investigate police misconduct, either. Another hidden detail in Chapter 17 is the call to “Promptly and properly eliminate ... all existing consent decrees.” The Justice Department typically hands down consent decrees to local jurisdictions after investigations into police wrongdoing — think of them like court-ordered improvement plans. These decrees usually compel jails to improve their conditions or police departments to consider their tactics and report back to the Justice Department. Project 2025 argues the Justice Department should “disclaim” its ability to hand down consent decrees. Another target of this chapter is local and state attorneys who use their own discretion to pursue or not pursue prosecution. Project 2025 calls for the Justice Department to “initiate legal action against local officials—including District Attorneys—who deny American citizens the ‘equal protection of the laws’ by refusing to prosecute criminal offenses in their jurisdictions.” This would be a radical departure from the norm, and it goes against the very purpose of local district attorneys. As the Marshall Project's Jamiles Lartey explains, “Choosing which cases to pursue and which to drop is a core responsibility of prosecution, and one of the arguments for the local election of district attorneys is that communities may have different priorities on how these choices get made.” But no such quarter would be given in a second Trump term. If you’d prefer a Justice Department that will defend and uphold voting rights, I have bad news for you: Project 2025 would reorient the federal government’s role from upholding voting rights to suppressing them. It takes specific aim at so-called mail-in ballot fraud and other types of voting and registration that became targets of The Big Lie: “With respect to the 2020 presidential election, there were no DOJ investigations of the appropriateness or lawfulness of state election guidance. ... The Pennsylvania Secretary of State should have been (and still should be) investigated and prosecuted for potential violations.” That paragraph explicitly targets a specific official whom Trump blames for his 2020 election loss. Again, what could go wrong? If implemented, Project 2025’s new-era Justice Department would cement long-standing grudges Trump holds against the various legal guardrails he crashed into during his four years in office and in the years since, and it would mutate the Justice Department into nothing more than a crude beating stick for Trump and his allies to use against their perceived enemies."
Trump’s ‘won’t have to vote anymore’ remarks sounded just like his authoritarian idols,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 10:25 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-wont-vote-remarks-reflect-authoritarian-idols-rcna164167,"Legal scholar Dahlia Lithwick’s sobering comments after the Supreme Court gave Donald Trump broad immunity from prosecution have stuck with me ever since. “As an official representative of the legal commentariat I want to suggest that tonight’s a good news cycle to talk to the fascism and authoritarianism experts,” she tweeted July 1, the day of the ruling. “This is their inning now...” Those words came to my mind over the weekend as Trump was going viral for telling supporters that they “won’t have to vote anymore” in four years because “it’ll be fixed” — remarks that sure sounded like a clear signal that Trump is planning to end democracy if he’s elected president again. I think sometimes people can foolishly minimize such statements from Trump as if they simply reflect a thirst for power. But I doubt we’ve ever had a presidential hopeful as eager as Trump is to fawn over authoritarians. In fact, Trump was given multiple opportunities to explain his concerning comment on Monday night but failed to do so. So I think we should heed Lithwick’s advice and take a look at these strongman idols. Trump has praised the likes of China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. But his party is currently enamored with some lesser-known authoritarians, too, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele. And I question, sometimes, whether people know what kind of governance the MAGA movement is motioning toward with this. Orbán has railed against “mixed-race” countries and touted his vision of an “illiberal state.” His government has consolidated control of media outlets, and his Fidesz party has used gerrymandering to seemingly draw itself into power indefinitely. The party once sought to give parents more voting power than people without children — a plan that Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, pushed in 2021.  Bukele — El Salvador’s self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world” — is another favorite among American conservatives. He once ordered armed soldiers into parliament to pressure lawmakers. He has waged a violent crackdown on gangs, alarming human rights observers, and used that crusade to justify censoring the press. He also stacked El Salvador’s top court, which struck down a seeming constitutional ban on consecutive presidential terms. When you consider such actions against the backdrop of Trump’s repeated antidemocratic statements, it’s more than appropriate for us to consider how he just might try — if he wins in November — to achieve the kind of power his idols have."
JD Vance’s record of deriding people without kids gets even worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 9:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-record-deriding-people-kids-gets-even-worse-rcna164297,"When Donald Trump sat down with Laura Ingraham for his latest Fox News interview, the host noted that his running mate has faced criticisms for his comments about Americans who don’t have children. The Republican nominee shrugged it off. In fact, the former president took the opportunity to insist that Sen. JD Vance is “not against” those without biological kids of their own. Trump added that he’s confident that women “understand” the Ohio senator’s true beliefs. It’s clear, the Republican added, “when you listen to his words.” The trouble is, we’ve been listening to Vance’s words quite a bit, and they’re not getting any less controversial. The Ohioan’s first full week as a candidate for national office was quite dreadful for a variety of reasons, but one comment from his record stood out. As we’ve discussed, during Vance’s first campaign for elected office three years ago, the then-Senate candidate appeared on Fox News and diagnosed what he saw as a crisis plaguing the United States. The country, Vance told a national television audience, was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It’s just a basic fact.” The future senator specifically included Vice President Kamala Harris — who has step-children, but no biological children of her own — in his societal condemnation. The ugliness of Vance’s rhetoric — rooted in the idea that those without biological children are somehow lesser, unreliable, and undeserving of positions of leadership — generated considerable attention, leading the vice presidential candidate to concede his comments were “sarcastic.” But when offered an opportunity to walk back his rhetoric, Vance instead doubled down on the underlying point. In a separate media appearance last week, the Republican also tried to defend himself by arguing that Harris called for “an end to the child tax credit,” which wasn’t true. But making matters even worse is the totality of Vance’s record. CNN reported: As recently as November 2020, for example, Vance said on a podcast that childless Americans, especially those in the country’s “leadership class,” were “more sociopathic” than those with children and made the country “less mentally stable.” Vance went on to say that in his experience, the “most deranged” and “most psychotic” people he sees on social media were also typically childless. The “childless cat ladies” comments, in other words, were not a one-off. Vance has been condemning Americans without kids repeatedly, for years. Indeed, it’s been genuinely challenging to keep up with the avalanche of reporting on this, just from the past few days. Media Matters, for example, uncovered several additional Fox interviews in which Vance lashed out at “childless” Democrats. Media Matters also found a Breitbart news interview in which the Ohio Republican claimed that the left’s “next generation leaders,” including “the Kamala Harrises, they don’t have kids. And so there’s this weird way where they want to take our kids and brainwash them so that their ideas continue to exist in the next generation.”  There’s also been extensive reporting of late about Vance suggesting that parents should have greater voting rights than Americans without children, and federal tax policies should “punish” those without children for their “bad” choices. Mother Jones’ David Corn, meanwhile, uncovered a speech in which Vance said he receives unflattering media coverage because he thinks most journalists are “childless adults.” HuffPost added a report of its own, shining a light on comments the Republican senator made in 2021 about the need to ""go to war” against the idea that women can decide not to have children, suggesting that someone who focuses on building their career instead of making babies will be “a sad, lonely, pathetic person.” Remember, as far as Trump is concerned, Vance is “not against” those without biological kids of their own. All people have to do, the former president said, is “listen to his words.” I have a follow-up question for the GOP nominee: “Have you listened to his words?” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Trump defends JD Vance's 'childless cat ladies' comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 9:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-rcna164236,"Donald Trump is trying to do some damage control as the fallout from his running mate’s comments about “childless cat ladies” continues. In an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham that aired Monday night, Trump defended Sen. JD Vance, saying his vice presidential pick's past attacks on women without children were simply due to his love for family. “He made a statement having to do with families,” Trump said. “That doesn’t mean people that aren’t a member of a big and beautiful family with 400 children around and everything else — it doesn’t mean that a person doesn’t have — he’s not against anything, but he loves family. It’s very important to him.” The GOP presidential nominee pointed to Vance’s “interesting family situation,” which the Ohio senator documented in his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” “He feels family is good. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong in saying that,” Trump said, accusing Democrats of “spinning things differently.” Vance's questionable views on family and women have come under scrutiny in recent weeks. Trump’s attempt to portray his running mate’s past comments as innocuous is not exactly convincing, given the disdain with which the Ohio senator himself spoke about women without children. Vance lamented to Fox News in 2021 that the country was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Vance’s comments have provoked intense backlash from Democrats and risk jeopardizing the Republican presidential ticket’s support among undecided voters, including women. Last week, Vance himself went on the defensive, saying in an interview that his “childless cat ladies” barb was part of his argument that Democrats are “anti-family and anti-child.” “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment,” he said. “I’ve got nothing against cats.”"
What the Trump immunity ruling says about the Roberts Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 9:25 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-roberts-court-rcna164239,"Throughout the Donald Trump immunity litigation leading up to the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this month, questions abounded over whether the court would step in to decide the issue, when it would do so, and how — including whether the court might achieve a unanimous opinion on presidential power as it had historically. When we finally saw the decision on July 1, we learned that the court was far from unanimous in Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion granting Trump (and other former presidents) broad criminal immunity. A new report sheds light on the court’s deliberations and Roberts’ further rightward shift, suggesting that a partisan divide on presidential immunity was seemingly inevitable under the chief justice’s leadership. The report by CNN chief Supreme Court analyst and Roberts biographer Joan Biskupic, which hasn’t been confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC, recounted that sources familiar with the court’s deliberations said “there was an immediate and clear 6-3 split” in the case. Biskupic reported that Roberts “made no serious effort to entice the three liberal justices for even a modicum of the cross-ideological agreement that distinguished such presidential-powers cases in the past. He believed he could persuade people to look beyond Trump.” Roberts reportedly declined to respond to CNN’s questions about the recent term and this case.  To recap, the court could’ve taken up the immunity issue in December, when special counsel Jack Smith asked the justices to do so at an earlier stage of litigation in the federal election interference case. The court declined. After the federal appeals court ruled against Trump, the high court granted review of his appeal in February but didn’t schedule a hearing until the last argument day of the term in late April — in fact, the court scheduled a new last day for the immunity case. The July 1 ruling came on the final decision day of the term, months out from the presidential election whose outcome could lead to Trump crushing his federal cases if he wins.  It was a 6-3 ruling, with Republican appointees in the majority, though Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett disagreed with part of Roberts’ opinion that curbed the use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of private conduct. That part of the ruling has called into question Trump’s New York state guilty verdicts, which weren’t at issue in his federal election interference appeal. President Joe Biden just called for a constitutional amendment — the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment” — to counteract the ruling. So, what does Roberts’ handling of the immunity appeal tell us about him and his court? Biskupic wrote that the chief justice “appears to have abandoned his usual institutional concerns.” That’s one way to look at it.  Another is that his institutionalist reputation has long been overblown, at least when it comes to his rulings — which, to be sure, haven’t always represented the furthest right flank of the court, such as his concurring opinion in Dobbs, which wouldn’t have overturned Roe v. Wade; the other five Republican-appointed justices accomplished that without him. But that may say more about the fact that this far-right court doesn’t need Roberts’ vote to achieve its ends. The immunity episode, then, suggests that the chief justice is not only eager to be in on the court’s rightward march but wants to lead the way.

Trump pressed for answers after saying supporters ‘won’t have to vote’ again,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 8:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pressed-answers-saying-supporters-wont-vote-rcna164264,"Given Donald Trump’s apparent discomfort with being described as a threat to American democracy, it’s tempting to think the former president would be cautious when talking about voting and elections. And yet the Republican is doing largely the opposite. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly said that he and his political operation “don’t need” votes — a curious comment from a candidate for public office — which has dovetailed with his latest comments that his Christian supporters “won’t have to vote anymore“ if he wins a second term. It was against this backdrop that the GOP nominee sat down yesterday with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, who offered Trump multiple opportunities to clarify matters and explain what he meant. It didn’t go especially well. The host began by saying Trump’s critics are “attacking” him for “ridiculous reasons,” adding, “They’re saying that you said to a crowd of Christians that they won’t have to vote in the future.” Of course, “they” are saying that because Trump really did tell a Christian audience that that they won’t have to vote in the future. Nevertheless, the Republican initially responded by talking about his popularity with Christian voters, before shifting his attention to Jewish voters. Eventually, he doubled down on his controversial comments, explaining that Christians “won’t have to vote anymore” after he’s done “straightening out the country.” It appeared as if the Fox anchor simply wanted Trump to say that he supports democracy and future elections, but the former president apparently didn’t get the hint. On the contrary, he largely echoed the same point all over again, saying that his “simple” message to Christian voters is, “You have to vote on November 5th. After that, you don’t have to worry about voting anymore.” At that point, Trump added, “We won’t even need your vote anymore.” It would’ve been very easy for him to say, “Of course we’ll have elections in the future, and of course Americans will be encouraged to participate in their own democratic system.” But that’s not what he said — despite having opportunities to do so. Following up on our coverage from yesterday, one possible interpretation of Trump’s rhetoric is that he wants the public to believe that by the end of his prospective second term, his far-right vision will be so entrenched in the American system that it will be effectively election-proof. MAGA world will endure for the indefinite future, the argument goes, so whether the Republican’s followers vote or not in 2028 will be irrelevant — because there will be nothing Democrats can do to reverse what’s been done. The less charitable interpretation is that Trump envisions a future without elections. For his part, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas insisted on Sunday that the former president was “obviously making a joke“ with his controversial comments. At no point during Trump’s interview with Fox’s Ingraham did he say he was kidding."
Kamala Harris might have an opening on the economy that Biden didn't,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 7:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-poll-economy-inflation-rcna164099,"A number of early surveys measuring the popularity of Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, look promising for her and her party. Several show Harris quickly surpassing President Joe Biden when pitted against former President Donald Trump in the polls. But one data point in particular has me feeling optimistic about Harris’ odds. A snap poll conducted by Democratic pollster Blueprint immediately after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris found that registered voters were split 50-50 on whether she or Trump would do a better job “bringing down prices” on goods and services. “The upside for Harris is huge: Voters do not hold her accountable for Biden’s perceived failures on inflation, and she can run hard on economic messaging,” Blueprint lead pollster Evan Roth Smith told Semafor. To use a Bidenism, this is a big f---ing deal.  Harris coming in even with Trump on inflation might not sound all that positive, but it is. Countless polls have shown that Biden was weak against Trump on the economy, and specifically on inflation. Biden struggled to win back voter trust on the economy, despite the fact that inflation has dissipated, wages have grown and the economy is by many metrics, including the unemployment rate, very strong. It seems that, for at least some of the electorate, the memory of high inflation earlier in Biden’s term stuck to him and was hard to shake off, particularly as housing inflation remains high.  But it looks like Harris might have a chance to instantly shed Biden’s second-biggest political liability — behind only questions about his mental acuity. Harris getting an opportunity to reset the Democrats on the economy is an especially big deal because it looms particularly large in the eyes of undecided voters who could play a decisive role in the election. While Biden’s ""defense of democracy"" narrative played well with the plugged-in Democratic base, less politically engaged voters are more focused on their pocketbooks. If Harris is seen as either not responsible for or less responsible for inflation, it could make them more receptive to her pitch on economic issues. Republicans are starting to roll out attacks on Harris as liable for inflation during Biden’s term; it’s unclear how much of it will stick. Inflation has been notably absent from Harris’ opening case to voters in speeches and her first campaign video. It’s possible she wants to avoid drawing attention to the issue during the initial phase of her campaign, during which she wants to focus in positive terms about her vision for the country and exploit a honeymoon period with the press and the electorate.  But she won’t be able to avoid it indefinitely. Harris will need to settle upon strategies for discussing the Biden administration’s record on the issue; unveil her policy plan to address concerns that some costs remain too high (especially housing) or fears that high inflation could return; and determine whether she will home in on Trump’s extremist tariff plans as inflationary. There are no easy answers here, as the Harris campaign will have to balance trying to focus on narratives that most naturally play to her strengths against addressing voter concerns. But her performance in the polls suggest that there’s a window for her to make a case that Biden couldn’t."
GOP leaders make odd choices for task force on Trump rally shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 7:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-leaders-make-odd-choices-task-force-trump-rally-shooting-rcna164254,"During his relatively brief tenure as Congress’ top Republican, House Speaker Mike Johnson has confronted a couple of important personnel challenges. The first came several weeks ago when the Louisiana congressman had to choose two new members of the House Intelligence Committee — and as members of both parties came to agree, Johnson did not choose wisely. His second personnel challenge came this week, and by some measures, the House speaker’s newest failure was even more dramatic than his first. The Washington Post reported: To be sure, there is no controversy surrounding the existence of this new congressional task force. There’s broad support for investigating the attempt on Trump’s life, and the official inquiry will move forward with bipartisan backing. But as the process advances, it’s worth pausing to consider who Johnson appointed to the panel. Indeed, it’s difficult to pick which of the task force’s GOP members is the most controversial. Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, for example, is an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and who’s also faced some unfortunate ethics questions. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee is also an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and his right-wing background was so controversial in 2017 that the Senate wouldn’t confirm him when Trump nominated him to serve as secretary of the Army. The panel will be chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who, in addition to being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, is also up to his ears in the fake elector scandal; has accused Barack Obama of running a secret “shadow government”; and initially responded to the recent assassination attempt targeting Trump by describing it without evidence as an “attack from the left.” But perhaps most notable of all is Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana — an election denier who’s also taken a leading role in concocting deeply weird conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, including bizarre allegations related to the FBI and “ghost buses.” As a recent New York Times report summarized, “Even by a conspiracy theorist’s standards, the wild claims made by Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, stand out.” Some might see this and question the relevance. Perhaps, the argument goes, these House Republicans pushed ridiculous conspiracy theories related to the 2020 elections and the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, but this investigation is about the shooting that nearly killed Trump. It is, some might argue, an entirely unrelated matter. Perhaps, but judgment matters. The shooting in Pennsylvania was deadly serious and deserves to be scrutinized by credible and responsible members of Congress who care about evidence and reality. The goal is to produce findings that the American public will be able to believe. For Johnson to choose fringe figures such as Higgins for this task force was an avoidable mistake."
Mark Meadows cites Trump immunity ruling in his own Supreme Court appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 6:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/meadows-cites-trump-immunity-ruling-supreme-court-rcna164160,"The full effect of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling on Donald Trump’s criminal cases isn’t yet known, saying nothing of its implications for the future of the presidency and the country. But while the application of Trump v. United States is slowly playing out in the GOP presidential nominee’s cases, another beneficiary of the ruling may be his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Meadows cites the July 1 ruling several times in his new Supreme Court petition, seeking the justices’ help in moving his Georgia state 2020 election interference case to federal court. Both the federal trial and appeals courts rejected Meadows’ claim, with the latter deciding that federal officer removal isn’t even available to former officers like Meadows and that, even if it was, his Georgia charges don’t relate to his official duties so he needs to stay in state court. Represented by top conservative lawyer Paul Clement at the Supreme Court, Meadows calls the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling “egregiously wrong, wholly unprecedented, and exceptionally dangerous,” arguing that “what matters is a federal officer’s status at the time of the conduct at issue, not her status at the time the prosecutor or plaintiff gets around to filing suit.” Even before the high court majority bestowed broad immunity on his former boss, there was reason to think that the justices might take interest in Meadows’ case. The 11th Circuit admittedly broke new ground in its ruling, with the three-judge appeals court panel acknowledging that “in the 190-year history of the federal-officer removal statute, no court has ruled that former officers are excluded from removal.” Notably, that appellate ruling was authored by a jurist well-respected in conservative circles, the circuit’s chief judge, William Pryor. Also notable is that the two Democratic-appointed judges on the panel agreed with the legal outcome but wrote separately to lament the “nightmare scenario” of not extending removal to former officers, arguing that “not extending the federal-officer removal statute to former officers for prosecutions based on their official actions during their tenure is bad policy, and it represents a potential threat to our republic’s stability.” To be sure, they noted that Meadows’ case still shouldn’t go to federal court even if former officers could get removal, because he “has not established that the State has charged him for or relating to an act under color of his office as White House chief of staff.” Nonetheless, to address their broader concerns, they called on Congress to amend the law to expressly include former officers. “The far better course is for this Court to intervene,” Meadows urged the justices in the petition, citing the Trump immunity ruling for, among other things, the proposition that “federal protections cannot prevent the distortion of federal decisionmaking by current officeholders if they expire as soon as they leave office, as this Court reiterated just this past Term.” The Georgia state prosecution brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis against Trump, Meadows (they’ve both pleaded not guilty) and others is currently on hold pending a separate pretrial appeal over the defense attempt to disqualify Willis. Meadows’ petition adds yet another wrinkle if the justices’ agree to review his appeal. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Arizona mayor becomes the latest Republican to back Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 6:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizona-mayor-becomes-latest-republican-back-harris-rcna164241,"Vice President Kamala Harris picked up endorsements this week from several mayors of border towns in Arizona, but one new endorsement from the Grand Canyon State stood out from the rest. John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona’s third-largest city, endorsed the Democrat in an op-ed for The Arizona Republic, despite the fact that Giles is a Republican. The mayor described Harris as “the competent, just and fair leader our country deserves,” while describing Trump as “a felon” and “a serious threat to our nation.” Giles went on to write, “I believe my party has a moral and ethical responsibility to restore faith in our democratic institutions. In the spirit of the late Sen. John McCain’s motto, ‘Country First,’ I call on other Arizona Republicans to join me in choosing country over party this election and to vote against Donald Trump.” This announcement comes on the heels of a similar endorsement from former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a lifelong Republican who threw his support behind Harris last week. For the vice president, this isn’t a bad start. After all, Harris has only been a candidate for nine days, and given the state of the cotemporary GOP, it’s not easy for any Democratic candidate to pick up cross-party backing. Looking ahead, though, it’s only natural to wonder whether Giles and Duncan represent the start of a trend or whether they’ll be 2024 outliers. Before President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, he’d picked up some Republican backing, including a high-profile endorsement from former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson also encouraged people to vote for the Democratic incumbent, and former deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews made a similar announcement. As best as I can tell, they haven’t yet thrown their support behind Harris, though it wouldn’t come as too big of a surprise if they did. But will other Republicans follow suit? I kept a close eye on this dynamic four years ago and found quite a few GOP partisans — former Republican National Committee chairs, former Republican cabinet secretaries, former Republican governors and former Republican members of Congress — who publicly expressed support for the Biden-led Democratic ticket. As Election Day 2024 approaches, they are likely to face some pressure to do the same this year. Watch this space."
Where exactly do Trump's remaining criminal cases stand?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 30, 2024, 6:16 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-legal-cases-where-they-stand-rcna163832,"July 2024 might better be remembered as the month in American politics that felt like a year: Former President Donald Trump avoided an assassination attempt and named his vice presidential nominee in a series of days; his then-political rival withdrew from the 2024 race and endorsed his own vice president. But focusing only on politics ignores a pair of massive developments in special counsel Jack Smith’s two federal criminal cases against Trump, which are expected to end if Trump is re-elected. Still, while both cases have hit serious roadblocks, neither is over by a long shot. Here’s where the federal cases stand: In Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon ruled this month that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s November 2022 appointment of Smith as special counsel and the Justice Department’s funding of the special counsel office’s expenses were inconsistent with not one, but two provisions of Article II of the Constitution: the so-called Appointments and Appropriations Clauses. Therefore, Cannon held that the case could not continue, regardless of whether Trump’s other objections were valid. Smith's office has made clear how and where it plans to forge ahead. Specifically, with the blessing of the DOJ, the special counsel filed an appeal of Cannon’s July 15 order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which oversees federal trial courts in Florida, as well as Alabama and Georgia.  Some legal experts, including former federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst Mary McCord, had argued that having the DOJ reindict the case would be the best and most expeditious way to get that case back on track. But according to former U.S. attorney and MSNBC legal analyst Joyce Vance, “If the special counsel pursues the appeal, the DOJ is extremely unlikely to reindict during its pendency, among other reasons because it would likely moot the appeal.” Note also that to date, Smith's office has only filed a notice of appeal, which is like a declaration of its intent. The actual brief is not due until Aug. 27. Currently, Trump’s opposition to the appeal is due 30 days thereafter, and the special counsel can submit a reply 21 days after that. With briefing ending in mid-October and no oral argument date set, it is unlikely the 11th Circuit would issue an opinion before the election — and to date, the special counsel’s office has not asked the court to expedite briefing and consideration of the appeal. Yet in 2022, Smith requested — and got — an expedited briefing when he successfully appealed Cannon’s appointment of a special master to review materials seized at Mar-a-Lago in August of that year. The time frame for Smith's appeal could be equally critical here. The bottom line: The Mar-a-Lago documents case is over for now — but it could come back with a vengeance after the 11th Circuit rules, assuming Trump is not back in the Oval Office by then. While the classified documents case awaits appellate briefing, the federal election interference case pending in Washington, D.C., before Judge Tanya Chutkan has yet to be restarted after the Supreme Court’s broad immunity decision in Trump v. United States. But that case is widely expected to be curtailed. For example, the majority opinion holds unambiguously that Trump is “absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.” Therefore, going forward, legal experts expect neither the charges themselves nor the evidence can refer to Trump’s conversations with then-Attorney General Bill Barr; his acting successor, Jeffrey Rosen, and Rosen’s deputy, Rich Donoghue; and even Trump’s alleged co-conspirator, then-acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark. Yet the Supreme Court was equally clear that sorting through when immunity applies to the remainder of the indictment, at least “in the first instance,” is a job for Chutkan. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, she must: The court therefore ordered that the case be remanded — or returned — to Chutkan to determine whether these categories of alleged conduct are official or unofficial, and if official, whether the presumption of immunity can be rebutted. What form that process will take has yet to be resolved. Some legal experts believe the Supreme Court’s repeated references to “factbound” or “fact specific” analyses require Chutkan to hold one or more evidentiary hearings ""replete with important witness testimony,"" as MSNBC legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann has written. After all, in classifying Trump’s public statements and tweets on and about Jan. 6, the Supreme Court noted that Chutkan could find relevant “what else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally.” That sort of information is not evident from the indictment and would require additional proof. On the other hand, other aspects of the task thrust into Chutkan’s hands seem to lend themselves to a more straightforward, albeit close, reading of the indictment, supplemented by briefs from the parties, as the Supreme Court suggests. Public reporting also indicates Trump's team intends to argue that Chutkan can resolve which conduct is and is not immune ""based on legal arguments alone, negating the need for witnesses or multiple evidentiary hearings,"" which could be embarrassing or even politically damaging to Trump as he again campaigns for the presidency. But no matter how Chutkan intends to move ahead, she cannot start quite yet. Rather, a Supreme Court rule provides that unless the whole court or an individual justice orders or the parties themselves agree otherwise, a case does not come back to the trial court for 32 days after the judgment is entered. The special counsel did not plan to ask the Supreme Court to expedite that timing, NBC News reported earlier this month. Still, why wouldn't the special counsel attempt to revive the case more quickly? Some believe that in lieu of delving into an extensive fight over which allegations and charges can be leveled against Trump, Smith’s office might first attempt to narrow its case by streamlining its indictment. That could mean substituting a new or superseding indictment for the existing one, but it’s not as simple as merely preparing a revised document. Instead, Smith would need a grand jury to review and approve such an indictment. Experts note that given the extensive testimony previously presented, prosecutors would not need to recall witnesses. A so-called summary witness, such as an FBI agent assigned to the case, could read relevant excerpts of such testimony to a grand jury, for example.  But in any event, the case will not be sent back to Chutkan earlier than Aug. 2. And in February, during a hearing in another Jan. 6-related case, Chutkan revealed plans to be out of the country days later, on Aug. 5, unless the Trump trial were ongoing then. A review of publicly available court calendars reflects that Chutkan does not have any scheduled matters next month until Aug. 15. Assuming, however, that Chutkan does convene some form of public hearing in mid-August or shortly thereafter, the contours of what would transpire at such a conference, or whether any briefing will be ordered in advance, remains unclear. Moreover, some reports suggest Trump’s lawyers intend to file other pretrial motions unrelated to immunity once Chutkan retakes the reins. For example, despite successfully litigating the issue before Cannon, Trump’s team never moved to dismiss the Washington case on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed and that his office was unlawfully funded. That could be because, in 2019, the D.C. Circuit rejected nearly identical arguments concerning the appointment of then-special counsel Robert Mueller. Nonetheless, at oral argument in the presidential immunity case, Trump lawyer John Sauer intimated it was just a question of timing: ""We hadn't raised it yet in this case when this case went up on appeal."" Given Trump's potential challenge to Smith's very authority to indict Trump in Washington and with Chutkan perhaps not assuming control of the case again for several more weeks, it's not clear that the evidentiary hearings some think are warranted will happen any time soon. In fact, Chutkan holding any evidentiary hearing at all before year’s end might be a feat of judicial oversight and control in and of itself.  The bottom line: Though the federal election interference case has technically survived the Supreme Court’s ruling, that decision will almost certainly bog the case down with legal wrangling over the coming months. And whether even a slimmed-down case progresses will hinge on further appeals and the election itself, because if Trump wins in November, this case is effectively over."
‘Duckin’ Don’: Team Harris ridicules Trump over new debate dodge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/duckin-don-team-harris-ridicules-trump-new-debate-dodge-2024-election-rcna164227,"It was nearly three months ago when Donald Trump and his campaign team agreed to participate in some presidential debates, including an event on Sept. 10, shortly before early voting begins in some states. At the time, of course, the Republican and his political operation assumed he’d share a stage with President Joe Biden. They now know better — and their willingness to honor the original schedule is, at a minimum, in flux. Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed-upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’d been a candidate for less than a week. The likely Democratic nominee went a little further yesterday, explaining that she will, in fact, be on the stage for the event, whether her GOP rival agrees to participate or not. “We’ll see if Trump shows,” Harris’ spokesperson added. As things stand, the odds of Trump agreeing to another general election debate aren’t great. The Associated Press reported on the former president’s latest comments on the subject, aired last night on Fox News. Fox’s Laura Ingraham pressed him on this point several times, and the Republican nominee kept hedging. Trump said he “likes” debating and “wants” to debate Harris, before adding, “But I also can say this: Everybody knows who I am.” When the host asked, “Why not debate her?” Trump didn’t contest the premise of the question. He instead replied, “Because [voters] already know everything.” The former president added that if he agreed to the Sept. 10 debate, it would “reward fake news,” and he’s against making ABC News “rich.” These were not the words of someone who seems eager to share a debate stage with Harris. With this in mind, let’s recap recent events. July 21: Within hours of Biden ending his 2024 candidacy, Trump started hedging on a possible debate and complaining about ABC News, despite the fact that his campaign team had already agreed to have ABC News host the next event. July 23: Trump doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later in the day, he told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate Harris, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything.” July 25: Aides to Trump said they wouldn’t commit to another debate. July 29: Trump appeared on Fox News and hedged some more, arguing that he “can also make a case for not doing it.” After the interview aired, the Harris campaign issued a press release with a headline that referred to the former president as “Duckin’ Don.” The statement from the vice president’s spokesperson added, “Why won’t Donald Trump give a straight answer on debating Vice President Harris? It’s clear from tonight’s question-dodging: He’s scared he’ll have to defend his running mate’s weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president. Vice President Harris will be on the debate stage September 10th. Donald Trump can show up, or not.” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Kamala Harris got Democrats excited. Mark Kelly can help them win.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-running-mate-arizona-vet-mark-kelly-rcna164194,"The last few weeks have given the country a massive dose of perspective. From the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden’s stepping aside, politicians and voters have endured weeks of political turmoil.   Now, with the Democratic nomination in her sights, all eyes turn to Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate search.  Outside of finding a Republican like former Rep. Adam Kinzinger or an unaffiliated leader like Adm. William McRaven, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is the best pick for the Democrats — especially if they want to attract incredibly important independent voters. First off, Kelly is a Navy combat pilot with significant military experience. That is big. Plus, he’s an astronaut, which means bipartisan respect and exciting star power (and cool stories). He’s more than prepared to be commander in chief if called upon. But despite his decades of leadership, Kelly isn’t a Washington insider.  Kelly is from Arizona, of course, and would bring a somewhat maverick spirit to the ticket in the style of fellow Arizonan John McCain. He is married to the universally beloved and politically experienced former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He’s a straight, white, tough man who can talk guns, abortion and the border, and he is moderate by modern Democratic Party standards — which is critical.  I’ve met Kelly; he’s the real deal as a human. He would be a powerful contrast to the sketchiness of Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. And both Vance and Trump would have a hard time landing blows against this American hero.  Overall (and perhaps most of all), Kelly is the closest to an independent or Republican option among the reported finalists. That may not make the more progressive wing of the party happy, but ultimately the trade-off should be worth it.   In 2020, Democrats did the right thing to win. They picked Biden over some of the more progressive options like Sen. Bernie Sanders and selected Harris for balance. She was a key part of a ticket that needed to mobilize and inspire.  This year is different. Many Democrats are already excited about Harris’ surprise top billing. Some Republicans are, too. But emotion isn’t enough. In June, before Biden stepped aside, polls showed that a quarter of Americans had unfavorable views of both candidates. In 2022, the majority of millennials and Gen Zers old enough to vote identified as independent — a significant antiestablishment rebellion that shows no signs of reversing. At the end of this month, Gallup reported that 41% of all respondents identified as “independent.” (Of these independent respondents, slightly more lean Republican than Democrat.) Winning over these millions of independent-minded voters — especially in swing states — could very well determine the outcome of the election. I didn’t think Harris was Democrats’ best option to replace Biden, especially in the context of an increasingly independent voting population. And she still has some very key weaknesses — namely a lack of military experience and high negatives with both independents and Republicans — that must be offset.  More than any other option floated, Capt. Mark Kelly offsets those weaknesses. Harris is clearly getting Democrats excited. But adding Kelly would mean maybe they can win. Just maybe. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here and the case for Josh Shapiro here."
This billionaire Democrat’s brazen suggestion puts Kamala Harris in a lose-lose situation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-linkedin-reid-hoffman-ftc-chair-lina-khan-rcna163897,"LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has a request for Vice President Kamala Harris, should she become president: replace Lina Khan as head of the Federal Trade Commission. Khan is “waging war on American business,” he told CNN last week. Hoffman, to be clear, is not just another man with an opinion. The billionaire and political megadonor donated $10 million to the Biden-Harris campaign, pushed his peers to do the same and is planning on a major fundraising push in Silicon Valley for Harris. And his public demand to oust Khan is the latest sign America’s billionaires need to be reminded that government policy shouldn’t be dictated by those with the largest checkbook.   The Biden administration has been the most pro-worker and pro-consumer presidential administration in decades. That charge has been led, in part, by Khan. In her tenure as FTC chair, Khan has spearheaded efforts to block mergers that could result in monopolies in sectors ranging from big tech to grocery stores, and she has stood up for worker rights by moving to ban widely reviled noncompete agreements. It’s no surprise then that after Hoffman made his demand, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the Service Employees International Union came to Khan’s defense. This is a very democratic — with a small d — agenda. It is about freedom — the freedom to start a business and not worry about anti-competitive practices from deep-pocketed rivals, the freedom from unaccountable businesses that have no market incentives to worry about the needs and rights of their customers, and the freedom for workers to move jobs as they wish. It also happens to be a popular agenda — that is, with everyone but the most powerful. Khan’s pro-consumer, pro-worker, anti-monopoly agenda has attracted no small amount of hate from powerful and monied interests. Since Khan became FTC chair just over three years ago, the Wall Street Journal opinion page has printed more than 100 opinion pieces ranting about her record — an average of one screed every 11 days. Billionaires regularly take to CNBC to complain about her record; on Monday, media mogul Barry Diller referred to her as “a dope” and said that, if Harris wins, he would lobby her for Khan’s removal. These plutocrats are speaking up, in part, because Harris’ opinions on Khan are largely unknown. But their opening and influence would be much less if it wasn’t for our campaign financing system, which privileges access to money over the power of the ballot box. A study by Martin Gilens at Princeton University and Benjamin Page at Northwestern University confirmed that government action is much more likely to reflect the wants and sentiments of wealthy Americans and corporate interests than actual majority sentiment. Americans hate this reality. It’s a large part of why former President Donald Trump was able to ride “drain the swamp” to the White House in 2016. But it’s also a part of the reason he got tossed in 2020. Instead of draining the swamp, he appointed the wealthiest Cabinet in American history and opened up the spigots for those who sought to influence his administration. But the power of the corporate purse also helps explain why Democrats quickly embraced any business leader who spoke up and took on Trump. Seeking allies against Trump, it was a natural next step to elevate prominent business leaders who said they didn’t support his administration or re-election. Anti-Trump forces even celebrated Elon Musk when he resigned from a Trump business advisory council after the former president walked away from the Paris climate accords. As we know, Musk soon resumed his right-ward trajectory. Others who were quick to condemn Trump in the wake of Jan. 6, have also made their way back to supporting the former president, seemingly because he’s promising tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Money talks in both our culture and, the more money, the louder the voice. Take, for example, how voter concerns about Biden’s advanced age were largely ignored — until, that is, his shocking June debate performance led donors who had previously backed Biden’s re-election effort to shut their wallets. As for Trump, he barely mentions “drain the swamp” these days. He instead is campaigning on a grab bag of grievances, even as he privately visits major donors, tin cup in one hand and a for-sale sign in the other. Earlier this year, according to The Washington Post, he all but promised to do away with a laundry list of policies and regulations reviled by the fossil fuel companies if, in turn, their executives raised $1 billion for his campaign. All this explains why the wealthiest Americans are increasingly used to getting their way no matter what party is in charge — and why they are so quick to get offended when thwarted.   Hoffman’s got other beefs too — he’s also made it known he would like to see tariffs imposed under both Trump and Biden rolled back. Taken together, this brazenness leaves Harris in a terrible position. While she should keep Khan on, if she wins and decides, for whatever reason, to replace the current FTC chair, it will look like she is doing the bidding of billionaires. Calls for Harris to return Hoffman’s money, on the other hand, don’t solve the underlying problem either. Not only would it be hard to know what to give back, but Hoffman's case raises contributions from many other donors. And the real issue is that the legalized corruption that is the U.S. campaign financing system is hardly a way to run an effective and democratic government. Until that changes, nothing else will. "
The ridiculous moral panic over the Olympics’ opening ceremony,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 5:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/olympics-2024-apology-christians-last-supper-elon-musk-mike-johnson-rcna164008,"The moral panic over a scene of drag queens feasting at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics set off a firestorm of outrage from religious conservatives and politicians who believed the scene was a mockery of the Last Supper. Except it wasn’t about the Last Supper at all.  The so-called re-enactment was a scene of a bacchanal, a feast to the Greek god Dionysus. After all, the Olympics originated in ancient Greece, and the Greek gods were a part of the culture of that time. French director Thomas Jolly, who oversaw the opening ceremony show, explained that the scene was Dionysus arriving on a table and that it was meant to be representative of the gods of Olympus celebrating the Olympic Games. Tell that, though, to those unable to see the scene outside the lens of their conservative religious convictions. They inserted those beliefs into an Olympic celebration put on by the country that had a whole revolution against the oppression of the monarchy and Christianity. Criticisms arose from figures such as Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Barron, who took to X to condemn the scene. French Catholic bishops, who really ought to have known better, complained about the “mocking” of Christianity, and some Greek Orthodox Church representatives condemned the opening of the Olympics as “blasphemous.” Churches weren’t the only ones complaining. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform X, also panned the depiction of the drag queens. C-Spire, a tech company, announced that it was pulling its advertising during the Olympics because of the scene. The organizers of the Olympics apologized, saying that they didn’t mean any disrespect for the Christian faith but rather that they wanted to emphasize tolerance. Tolerance, sadly, isn’t what conservatives are noted for, especially since many of them deemed the 2024 Olympics “woke.” It is fascinating and understandable that the Christians and others who condemned the scene automatically went to the Last Supper as their reference point. Much of their worldview is limited and doesn’t consider views that fall outside their faith. First, the classical image of the Last Supper comes from da Vinci’s painting. It doesn’t represent the reality of what the Last Supper looked like. The confusion and misplaced anger over the scene tell us a lot more about conservative Christians and others than perhaps they want us to know. Moral panics like this one demand immediate strong denunciations and lamentations about the decline of morality and society. Moral panics are designed to take control of any narratives in society that are deemed evil or sinful. In this case, drag queens have been the cause of a political and religious firestorm not only in America, but also in conservative religious nations worldwide. Second, the fact that Christians immediately identified the scene as being the Last Supper suggests an intellectual simplicity and a knee-jerk reaction. Had any of these critics looked closely at the tableau, it didn’t resemble da Vinci’s Last Supper at all! The number of people at the table didn’t even match the 13 who would have been Jesus and his disciples. Their immediate gut-level response was telling. Not understanding the allusions to Greek mythology or the origins of the Olympic Games and their cultural context suggests that the book-burning, anti-history contingent of religious conservatives has coincided with their ignorance of art, culture, history and society. The Olympics are being held in Paris! There’s a reason there was a whole scene filled with headless Marie Antoinettes at the very prison in which she was held, listening to Gojira’s heavy metal music. It’s France, folks. It dealt with conservative religion and monarchy in its history in decisive and bloody ways. Curiously, religious conservatives didn’t have much to say about the menage a trois scene that was also included in the opening ceremony. Perhaps that wasn’t as sacrilegious to them as drag queens having a bacchanalia. The outrage surrounding this particular scene at the opening ceremony reveals several important things about conservative religion and politics at the present moment. One, trans persons and queer people continue to be the subject of ire and persecution from conservative religions. Sexuality is often the first place for persecution in societies that have conservative factions in majority politics. It also signals intolerance for not only these people, but also for the cultural context of the nation France. This particular level of criticism against France isn’t new — remember freedom fries from the Iraqi War? That didn’t last long, and I suspect this new moral panic won’t last over the course of the Olympics. After all, the outrage only shows just how limited in scope their imaginations are."
Dobbs was 'just the beginning:' Inside Project 2025's attack on abortion,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 3:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-abortion-trump-rcna164125,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 28 episode of ""Velshi."" Abortion is mentioned 199 times throughout Project 2025 — the Heritage Foundation's ambitious 920-page blueprint for a possible second Donald Trump administration. The forward reads in part: Along with suggesting that the Department of Health and Human Services should instead be known as “the Department of Life,"" the recommendations in Project 2025 target every aspect of reproductive health care. When it comes to medication abortion, the mandate states, “Abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world. ... [The] FDA should therefore: Reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the politicized approval process was illegal from the start.” But it's not just medication abortion that they’re going after. Project 2025 also aims to eliminate both the morning-after pill — which is emergency birth control — and men’s contraceptives, from Affordable Care Act coverage. On page 458, the mandate also suggests cracking down on what the document refers to as “mail order abortion,"" which would entail using the Comstock Act, a law from the 19th century, to prosecute people who send abortion pills — or potentially anything affiliated with abortion, like other medical supplies — by mail. On Page 455, Project 2025 lays out a plan to curb what it calls “abortion tourism,"" or instances in which women must travel to other states to seek medical care that is banned in their home state. It recommends the CDC implement mandatory data collection for all abortions nationwide — literally tracking and surveilling women who choose to get abortions. The plan also threatens to cut funding to any state that resists such surveillance. The mandate also spells out the specifics around emergency intervention, stating that emergency rooms have a legal obligation to protect the life of the fetus: “EMTALA — or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act — requires no abortions, preempts no pro-life state laws, and explicitly requires stabilization of the unborn child.”  In other words, Project 2025 says that in an emergency, when an abortion would save the life of the pregnant person, medical personnel are not required to perform that life-saving abortion. Now, I want to be clear about this: You may see claims that Project 2025 is taking a more moderate stance on abortion. You may hear that Project 2025 doesn’t call for a national abortion ban, or that it calls for differentiation between miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and elective abortion. But do not be fooled. Project 2025’s section on the HSS reads, in part, “The Secretary should pursue a robust agenda to protect the fundamental right to life. ... From the moment of conception, every human being possesses inherent dignity and worth. ... Abortion and euthanasia are not health care.” Littered throughout the 900-page Project 2025 mandate is the repeated declaration that life begins at conception — an idea also known as fetal personhood. Fetal personhood insists that, from the moment of conception, a fertilized egg is a person, endowed with the same rights as you and I. That claim strikes at the heart of everything I’ve listed above. Laws that establish fetal personhood, laws that mandate doctors to treat fetuses even when the pregnant person’s life is at risk — in practice, those laws are abortion bans. Full stop. Any policy that declares “life begins at conception” is an abortion ban for all intents and purposes and will result, in practice, in miscarriage patients being denied care that is needed to save their lives. That is not a guess. That is a fact. We are living in a post-Roe country now and we've seen it happen over and over again. Right now, abortion is banned in 21 states, with total bans in place in 14. Depending on where you live, there are varying exceptions — Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Mississippi, for instance, claim to allow exceptions to their abortion bans to save the life of the mother but not to save the health of the mother. That puts doctors in impossible positions — legally unable to perform an abortion, a necessary medical procedure, and forced to watch patients become sicker and sicker until they reach death’s door before they can move forward. Women who are miscarrying very often need abortions to save their lives, health and future fertility. Take the case of Amanda Zurawski in Texas. During her planned and wanted pregnancy, Amanda developed a condition that meant her fetus wasn't going to survive. The standard medical procedure for her condition was to terminate the pregnancy by performing a dilation and curettage — commonly referred to as a D&C. Also known as an abortion. Without an abortion, Amanda was at risk of developing a serious, potentially fatal infection. But her doctors said they couldn’t perform the procedure under Texas law because her nonviable fetus still had a heartbeat. She was told she wasn’t sick enough and she would have to wait. Days later, Amanda developed the infection she was warned she might get. She went into septic shock. Once her doctors finally performed the abortion, Amanda’s uterus and fallopian tubes were severely scarred. One of her fallopian tubes is now permanently blocked. Amanda sued the state of Texas in a lawsuit that eventually grew to include 20 women, many of whom experienced life or health-threatening complications due to the state's abortion ban. Earlier this summer, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Amanda and the other women. That's the reality of extreme abortion bans. That's the reality of living under governments that push fetal personhood. And that's the plan under Project 2025. As they state so clearly: The Dobbs decision is just the beginning."

Election officials declared President Nicolás Maduro the winner over opposition candidate Edmundo González early Monday during a press conference on Venezuelan state television.” * In the Middle East, on Saturday: “A rocket strike Saturday at a soccer field killed at least 11 children and teens, Israeli authorities said, in the deadliest strike on an Israeli target along the country’s northern border since the fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began. It raised fears of a broader regional war.” * In the Middle East, on Sunday: “Western diplomats were scrambling on Sunday to prevent a surge of fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border, officials said, after a rocket from Lebanon on Saturday killed at least 12 children and teenagers in an Israeli-controlled town. The rocket prompted Israel to retaliate early Sunday with strikes across Lebanon.” * In Ukraine: “The U.S. will send $1.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine, officials announced on Monday, including an array of munitions for air defense systems, artillery, mortars and anti-tank and anti-ship missiles. The package includes $1.5 billion in funding for long-term contracts through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $200 million in immediate military aid taken from Pentagon stockpiles.” * In Iowa: “Iowa’s strict abortion law went into effect Monday, immediately prohibiting most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Iowa’s Republican leaders have been seeking the law for years and gained momentum after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Iowa Supreme Court also issued a ruling that year saying there was no constitutional right to abortion in the state.” * A case of interest: “Two former FBI officials settled lawsuits with the Justice Department on Friday, resolving claims that their privacy rights were violated when the department leaked to the news media text messages that they had sent one another that disparaged former President Donald Trump. Peter Strzok, a former top counterintelligence agent who played a crucial role in the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016, settled his case for $1.2 million. Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer who exchanged text messages with Strzok, also reached a separate settlement.
