"What is Project 2025? The plans for Trump's second term, explained",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-what-know-trump-president-second-term-rcna160465,"A far-right blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration has become an increasing source of controversy, leading Trump to at least try to distance himself from it. But what would Project 2025 actually do? Clocking in at a staggering 920 pages, the proposal from the conservative Heritage Foundation and more than 100 like-minded groups outlines step-by-step plans to give the next president massive new powers and politicize federal agencies. It also outlines a long wish list of conservative ideas he would pursue with those powers. Among other things, Project 2025 proposes: • Passing sweeping tax cuts • Limiting the U.S. role in NATO • Developing new nuclear weapons • Abolishing the Department of Education and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration • Reversing the FDA’s approval of abortion pills • Reducing legal immigration • Ending Head Start • Stripping NPR and PBS of federal funding • Outlawing pornography While not new, the proposal has received a lot more attention in recent weeks. HBO host John Oliver dedicated a segment on his show, “Last Week Tonight,” to Project 2025, which has now been viewed 6.9 million times on YouTube alone. Black Entertainment Television Awards host Taraji P. Henson encouraged viewers to look up Project 2025 in late June. Other celebrities, such as actor Mark Hamill and singer Lizzo, have posted about it on social media. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts inadvertently drew more attention when he said in an interview that the U.S. was in the process of a ""second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be."" And now, there are signs that voters are responding. Searches for ""Project 2025"" have spiked on Google, while it has become a hot topic on Reddit, where a subreddit with more than 54,000 members is dedicated to defeating it. This guide answers some of the biggest questions Americans have about the conservative playbook. Trump has recently sought to distance himself from Project 2025, but he has close ties to the people behind it. Russ Vought, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, wrote the chapter on the executive office. John McEntee, who was director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office under Trump, is a senior adviser to Project 2025. Three former Trump administration staffers — Paul Dans, Spencer Chretien and Troup Hemenway — are listed as the heads of the Project 2025 team. The Heritage Foundation has a track record of getting Trump to support its ideas. In 2018, it claimed that Trump had carried out or embraced at least two-thirds of its ideas in his first year in office, exceeding a previous high-water mark set in President Ronald Reagan’s first year. In a 2022 keynote address at Heritage’s annual leadership conference, Trump effusively praised Roberts shortly after the latter became the group's president and said Roberts was ""going to be so incredible"" in his new role. Still, Trump denies any connection. ""I know nothing about Project 2025,"" he wrote on his Truth Social account last week. ""I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them."" Notably, the former president did not say which Project 2025 proposals he opposed. In November, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying that proposals by ""various non-profit groups are certainly appreciated and can be enormously helpful"" but stressing that ""none of these groups or individuals speak for President Trump or his campaign."" ""Unless a second term priority is articulated by President Trump himself, or is officially communicated by the campaign, it is not authorized in any way,"" it said. The proposal's most dramatic shift would be to reclassify thousands of federal jobs, allowing Trump to fire career employees and replace them with his picks. This would be the most dramatic shift in the federal workforce since the 1880s, when reformers ended the partisan ""spoils system,"" which led to incompetence, graft and corruption within federal agencies. ""Our goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained and prepared conservatives to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State,"" the authors say in a foreword. Trump previously tried this move toward the end of his presidency, signing an executive order to create the new job classification — known as ""Schedule F"" — in October 2020. President Joe Biden repealed that order when he took office and sought to add new protections for federal workers. Many other Project 2025 plans rely on this broad new proposed power, as they would need federal workers to sign off on implementation. Robert Shea, who served in the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, has said that Schedule F would create ""an army of suck-ups"" within the federal government since if federal workers objected that a policy was unwise, impractical or even illegal, they could be fired. The proposal would roll back many current efforts to fight climate change while also promoting oil and gas. In short, the proposal calls for a “whole-of-government unwinding” of what it calls “the Biden Administration’s climate fanaticism.” Project 2025 calls for ending subsidies for wind and solar power, making it easier to drill domestically for oil and natural gas and build nuclear power plants, promoting fossil fuels in the developing world, ending federal mandates and subsidies for electric vehicles and breaking up NOAA, which it says has “become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.” One section says the Environmental Protection Agency has used “fear-based rhetoric” about “the perceived threat of climate change” by overstating its “actual harms.” Another says the secretary of energy should “oppose eyesore windmills built at taxpayer expense.” The proposal would add new restrictions on legal immigration and use various executive actions to reshape the immigration system. Project 2025 would target the ""Dreamers,"" people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and who received protection from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Under Project 2025, the Department of Homeland Security would deprioritize staff work on DACA and other ""unlawful programs"" to the point that Dreamers would be unable to renew those protections. The proposal would take the same approach with Biden's Uniting for Ukraine program, which allows more Ukrainians to come to the U.S. The proposal also calls for blocking federal student loans to DACA recipients, as well as state colleges that provide in-state tuition rates to Dreamers. Project 2025 also calls for the secretary of homeland security to decline to update or expand H-2A and H-2B visas used by guest workers, restrict temporary visas given to victims of human trafficking, let Temporary Protected Status designations for countries affected by armed conflict or environmental disasters lapse and increase fees on immigration paperwork. An analysis from the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank, summarizes the proposals as a ""meticulously orchestrated, comprehensive plan to drive immigration levels to unprecedented lows"" while circumventing Congress and the courts. The proposal calls for a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of the Justice Department and the FBI, repeating Trump's baseless claims about the department and the bureau: It proposes changing the supervision of the FBI within the Justice Department to curb its independence, a move that critics say would give the president more power over prosecutions. It also calls for an ""immediate, comprehensive review"" of all active FBI investigations, ending any that are ""unlawful or contrary to the national interest"" and possibly issuing a public report. It would also bar the FBI from attempting to combat ""the spread of so-called misinformation and disinformation."" The proposal calls for reducing the federal role in education policy, including eliminating the Education Department and refocusing higher education policy on job skills. Overall, Project 2025 proposes eliminating federal education spending programs or turning them into ""no-strings-attached"" block grants that states could spend however they wanted. It also suggests tying federal spending directly to students, which would allow it to be used on private schools. (The proposal is vague about how exactly this would be implemented.) One section calls for ending Head Start, a comprehensive early education program for low-income children under five that has served about 39 million children since it started in 1965. The proposal also calls for rescinding the congressional charter of the National Education Association, the leading labor union for teachers and other educators, and conducting congressional hearings about its political activities. In higher education, it calls for focusing more on ""bolstering the workforce skills of Americans who have no interest in pursuing a four-year academic degree."" The proposal calls for limiting or ending student debt forgiveness programs, turning the current government-run student loan program over to a new federal authority and tightening income-driven student loan repayments. ""The new Administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,"" it says in a criticism of Biden's student debt forgiveness measures. ""The new Administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans."" The proposal criticizes the expansion of income-driven repayment programs, which tie payments on federal student loans to income. It says the Education Department should phase out existing programs and consolidate them in a new plan open only to the lowest-income Americans: The proposal calls for the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw its 2000 approval of mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill that has recently become a target of anti-abortion-rights activists. The U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected a legal challenge to the drug, arguing that a group of doctors who brought the case did not have standing to sue. Louisiana recently classified mifepristone and misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, as controlled dangerous substances. The proposal also calls for barring sending abortion pills through the U.S. mail or by private companies like UPS and FedEx by reviving the Comstock Act, an 1873 law, a move that abortion rights supporters say would amount to a ""backdoor scheme"" to ban abortion. It also proposes banning the military from spending any money to ""facilitate abortion for servicemembers,"" creating a ""pro-life task force"" in the Department of Health and Human Services to ""promote the life and health of women and their unborn children"" and appointing a ""special representative for domestic women's health."" ""HHS should return to being known as the Department of Life by explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care,"" it says. The proposal calls for the federal government to promote heterosexual marriage and proposes new restrictions on transgender Americans. On education policy, it would bar public educators from calling students by names other than what are listed on their birth certificates or pronouns other than their ""biological sex"" without written permission of their parents or guardians. It would also allow all public educators to opt out of using pronouns if they are ""contrary to the employee's or contractor's religious or moral convictions."" On health policy, it calls for ending any research based on “woke transgender activism” at the National Institutes of Health and having the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend that gender-reassignment surgery not be covered in state health plans. On military policy, Project 2025 proposes banning transgender Americans and people with HIV from serving in the military, expelling any current service members with ""gender dysphoria"" and barring the military from spending any money on ""transgender surgeries."" More broadly, the proposal calls for rescinding regulations that bar discrimination “on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics” and removing “divisive symbols such as the rainbow flag” from U.S. embassies as part of an effort to stop promoting “pro-LGBT initiatives” in Africa. The proposal also calls for the federal government to ""maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family,"" which it defines as a ""heterosexual, intact marriage:"" Another section calls for the secretary of health and human services to ""proudly state that men and women are biological realities that are crucial to the advancement of life sciences and medical care and that married men and women are the ideal, natural family structure because all children have a right to be raised by the men and women who conceived them."" The proposal calls for dramatically restricting pornography, arguing that it does not deserve First Amendment protection. The foreword argues that pornography — which it defines to include the “transgender ideology” — is “as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.” (Experts disagree about whether people can become addicted to porn the same way they get addicted to alcohol or drugs.) The proposal calls for a dramatic buildup of nuclear weapons, accelerating the development and production of new weapons despite current arms treaties. Among other things, Project 2025 proposes increasing funding for new and modernized nuclear warheads, developing a new sea-launched cruise missile, buying more intercontinental ballistic missiles and preparing to test new nuclear weapons. It also outlines transforming the U.S. role in NATO, reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe and requiring allies to provide ""the great majority of the conventional forces to deter Russia"" while relying on the U.S. to provide a nuclear weapons deterrent. The U.S. should ""expand and modernize the U.S. nuclear force so that it has the size, sophistication, and tailoring to deter Russia and China simultaneously,"" the proposal says. In an analysis of the proposal, the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said that it ""would accelerate the nuclear arms race the United States is already engaged in and encourage the expansion — or initiation — of new nuclear weapons programs in other nations around the globe."" The proposal calls for ending government funding for NPR, PBS and other public broadcasters and ending their status as noncommercial education stations, which exempts them from licensing fees and allows radio stations to broadcast at certain reserved frequencies that can be heard farther away. It notes, however, that this may not be easy. ""The President may have to use the bully pulpit, as NPR and PBS have teams of lobbyists who have convinced enough Members of Congress to save their bacon every time their taxpayer subsidies have been at risk since the Nixon era,"" it says. The proposal calls for dramatically simplifying the tax code in ways that would hurt lower-income earners and benefit people with higher incomes. Currently, the U.S. has seven federal income tax brackets, with rates from 10% for taxable income up to $11,000 to 37% on income higher than $578,125 in the 2023 tax year. As an intermediate step, Project 2025 calls for reducing that to two brackets of 15% and 30%; ending ""most deductions, credits and exclusions""; and setting a cap on untaxed employee benefits. In the long term, it calls for ""fundamental tax reform"" that could include implementing a national sales tax or requiring a supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. It also calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate from its current 21% rate to 18% and repealing various changes to the tax code in the Inflation Reduction Act. That bill, signed into law by Biden in 2022, included a corporate alternative minimum tax, a tax on stock buybacks and tax breaks for clean energy. An analysis of Project 2025 in Tax Notes found that these plans would depend on whether Democrats control the House or the Senate, allowing them to block legislation. But under unified Republican control, ""Trump would likely obtain passage of a great deal of his tax and spending proposals using a single budget reconciliation bill, which, instead of needing 60 votes to block a filibuster, would need only a simple majority,"" it noted."
J. Edgar Hoover should validate our fears about SCOTUS’s immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 2:49 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-immunity-fbi-rcna160514,"There’s been much talk about the gravity and impact of this month’s Supreme Court finding granting a former U.S. president presumptive immunity for “official” acts, and absolute immunity when exercising “core constitutional powers.” In the oral arguments preceding this decision, and in the dissenting opinion of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the justices raised the scenario of a president getting away with ordering Navy SEALS to kill a political opponent, using the military to stage a coup or accepting a bribe in exchange for a pardon. Chief Justice John Roberts called his colleagues’ remonstrations “extreme hypotheticals” and” fearmongering.” There was nothing extreme in Sotomayor’s concerns, and her fears were justified. As a national security analyst, with 25 years as an FBI agent, I know we don’t need to engage in hypotheticals to lay out this ruling’s likely consequences. All we need to understand what a criminally immune Trump might do, with even one executive branch agency given carte blanche, is to remind ourselves what the nation learned about the FBI during the 1970s. The great unraveling started in 1971, when a group of peace activists broke into a small FBI office in Media, Pa., and stole whatever files they could carry out. They suspected that the FBI was spying on anti-Vietnam war protestors, especially on college campuses. The files confirmed their suspicions, but unsure of what exactly they were looking at, they handed some of the files to reporters. One journalist, then-NBC reporter Carl Stern, was intrigued by a code word in the files: “COINTELPRO.” It would take years of dogged reporting, lawsuits to uncover documents and a number of congressional committee inquiries to fully learn the details of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s secret counterintelligence program to covertly address anything and anyone deemed to be a threat by Hoover or the presidents he served under. For over a year, a special Senate committee chaired by Idaho Democrat Frank Church conducted 800 interviews, demanded documents and held public and closed-door hearings. What they learned shocked the nation. The Church Committee and other investigations confirmed that the FBI, the CIA and the NSA had been unlawfully spying on American citizens. The FBI, with the approval of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and later with the encouragement of President Lyndon Johnson, illegally wiretapped Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders. The FBI sent a letter to King, using details uncovered in the wiretap, essentially blackmailing King and suggesting he kill himself. There were countless other “black bag jobs” where the FBI, without court authorization, broke into people’s homes, took evidence, opened and read mail, and planted microphones — all outside the law, because someone in power deemed those American citizens to pose some kind of threat. In 1968 and into the 1970s, Hoover claimed the Black Panther Party was “the greatest threat to internal security of the United States.” (It wasn’t.) Hoover discussed the Black Panthers with then-President Richard Nixon and got the green light to go after them, when, as Nixon directed, “you sort of had the scent of the smell of a national conspiracy thing. You know, the kind of thing like the Panthers, and all that … ”  The FBI developed an informant to penetrate the Panthers’ Illinois chapter. In the evening of Dec. 3, 1969, the informant drugged Fred Hampton, one of the chapter’s rising leaders. Chicago police officers, coordinating with the bureau, raided Hampton’s apartment and fatally shot him as he slept. Unsurprisingly, these sorts of actions did not stop at the Panthers. Nixon ordered the FBI to unlawfully wiretap members of the media without benefit of lawful court orders, simply because Nixon didn’t like those reporters. And, during the Watergate scandal, he ordered the CIA to tell the FBI to end their investigation into the illegal break-in directed by Nixon’s campaign. Remember, it was Nixon who infamously said during an interview, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” Nixon’s assertion was wrong back in the 1970s. Yet, with this month’s court ruling on absolute immunity, an American president can make that declaration with a straight face. If a president is acting within his Constitutional powers, they can tell the FBI to do almost anything to suppress any “threat” — real or imagined, political or not. According to a Reuters report, Trump’s allies are already planning to give their candidate direct control of DOJ and the FBI so that they will no longer function independent of the White House. “Two prominent Trump allies told Reuters they support eliminating the FBI’s general counsel” — the office that flashes a red light whenever the bureau is about to do something unlawful. If that red light is removed, there'd be nothing standing between a president and a crime spree. The Church Committee’s findings resulted in numerous regulations and policies that established guardrails to prevent the FBI and other intelligence agencies from unlawfully spying on Americans. The committee also established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to ensure that federal judges approve all national security wiretaps and covert search warrants. Today, a president could tell the FBI to ignore the formalities of the FISA court and simply spy on his enemies — without fear of criminal liability. Do Sotomayor’s hypotheticals seem “extreme” now? They shouldn’t, because we’ve already “been there, done that” as a nation. If none of this troubles you, you’re not paying attention. Because some day, a president you don’t support can designate you, your friends, your employer or your favorite organization or news platform a threat. That president could direct the FBI to spy on those entities and people, and you won’t know about it until it’s too late. It’s happened before, and it can happen again."
Why Trump doesn’t want you to know he knows about Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 2:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-truth-social-rcna160774,"There’s no sugarcoating it: The last few weeks have been bad for Democrats. And yet, former President Donald Trump and Republicans still appear to be panicking. The problem isn't President Joe Biden, who continues to combat internal pressure to step aside. Instead, the Republican Party, including apparently Trump himself, seems suddenly worried about growing mainstream awareness of Project 2025, a set of far-right policy initiatives developed by the Heritage Foundation and a slew of Trump-supporting thinkers and organizations. Last week Trump took to Truth Social to deny any knowledge of the project. “I know nothing about Project 2025,"" the former president wrote. ""I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.” You may have heard the expression, “A hit dog will holler”? Even for Trump, someone who lies easily and without remorse, the suggestion that he has “no idea who is behind” Project 2025 is laughably false. The truth is Project 2025 was enabled by a raft of former Trump administration officials, including Paul Dans, former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management; John McEntee, former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office; Rick Dearborn, former White House deputy chief of staff for legislative, intergovernmental affairs and implementation; Ben Carson, former Housing and Urban Development secretary; Ken Cuccinelli, former deputy secretary of homeland security; Peter Navarro, former director of the White House National Trade Council and director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy; Christopher Miller, former acting secretary of defense; Stephen Moore, an adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign; Russell Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget; William Pendley, former acting director of the Bureau of Land Management; Paul Winfree, former director of budget policy; Brooks Tucker, former chief of staff for the Department of Veterans Affairs; Roger Severino, former director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services; Kiron Skinner, former director of policy planning at the State Department; and Bernard McNamee, former commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  In fact, Project 2025 is staffed by more than 200 former officials of the Trump administration. Is it really possible that Trump is unfamiliar with the massive conservative project worked on by hundreds of his own former officials? Or is the toxicity of this agenda just that evident?  Common sense and Occam’s razor would suggest it’s the latter. And it does make a lot of sense that Trump would want to try to distance himself from the project, because it is legitimately extreme. The project’s main “playbook,” called “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,” is itself is over 900 pages. In a nutshell, the playbook calls for nullifying anti-climate-change efforts while supercharging its deadly effects, abolishing the Education Department and dramatically cutting back on free school meals and the Head Start program, cutting earned benefits like Medicaid, expanding the deportation powers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, banning pornography and imposing criminal penalties for those who produce it, strictly limiting abortion and rolling back pro-choice policies, blocking federal health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to trans people and consolidating presidential power significantly.  The fact that Trump is attempting to distance himself from this agenda is a testament to how obviously out of step it is with mainstream America. It’s not that he doesn’t agree with it; he just rightly recognizes that the vast majority of voters don’t. The bigger point here is that nothing Trump says about Project 2025 going forward has any credibility. And that’s important context for when Trump inevitably claims he would never try to implement any part of it. I’d be slightly more likely to believe he doesn’t remember who Ben Carson is."

"It’s over, insurgent Democrats. Biden’s not going anywhere.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 1:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-democrats-beat-trump-rcna160727,"President Joe Biden’s interview on “Morning Joe” today is exactly what everyone has been waiting and wanting to see from the president. What we saw this morning was quintessential Joe Biden; it was also just great politics. And his campaign should be doing more of it.  Democrats who want Biden to step aside have had over a week to get their act together and mount their insurgency. But now, that’s done. It’s over. I think the president ended it with that interview. I believe we’re going to look back at the debate, and all the chaos that followed, and see this interview as a market shift, the catalyst that the president’s campaign needed.  Biden can present himself as the scrappy insurgent, waging war on the elites who want him out of the race. There’s one person who will likely be very unhappy with that: Donald Trump. That’s the lane he’s always wanted — the “they’re ignoring you and I’m on your side” — and that’s the case Biden can now make to voters.Biden is going directly to the American people and saying he doesn’t need a filter, he doesn’t need any elite platforms, and he doesn’t need other elected officials because he is fighting for you. My only hope is that he doesn’t go totally silent for another extended six-day period. Or over plan for some news conference. Or go back up to Camp David and act like he’s prepping for the SATs or a McKinsey interview. Just let the guy be who he is. President Biden is the Democratic Party’s nominee. He’s not going to blink in this game of chicken. If any further Democrats come out against Biden, they are part of the problem, not the president. It’s time that everyone gets together, gets disciplined, and focuses on the actual problem: the existential threat to the future of this country, Donald Trump.  This is an adapted excerpt from the July 8 episode of Ana Cabrera Reports."
"On politicized prosecutions, Marco Rubio has a poor memory",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 11:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prosecutions-marco-rubio-trump-biden-memory-rcna160742,"By all accounts, Sen. Marco Rubio is a finalist for his party’s vice presidential nomination, and with this in mind, the Florida Republican has been an eager participant in the GOP’s “race to the bottom.” It was against this backdrop that the senator sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash, who asked about the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. In a move that likely pleased viewers at Mar-a-Lago, Rubio largely ignored the question and toed a partisan line. From the “State of the Union” transcript: The Republican senator added moments later that Trump, in a second term, wouldn’t target his perceived political foes. “His vengeance is going to be by winning and making America great again, not going after his political opponents,” Rubio said. So, a few things. First, if the senator or his allies have any evidence of White House officials “going after their political opponents,” Republicans have kept the proof well hidden. Second, the idea that Trump has no interest in vengeful, retaliatory tactics is belied by Trump repeatedly expressing explicit interest in vengeful, retaliatory tactics. Indeed, the question of whether or not the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would try to prosecute his perceived political enemies in a second term has already been answered by the former president himself many times: As regular readers know, Trump has publicly acknowledged his intentions in multiple interviews. Perhaps Rubio missed them. But of particular interest in the CNN interview was Rubio’s suggestion that Democratic fears of abuses are absurd. Look at that quote again: “It’s funny to me to read these people and hear these people out there warning about all the horrible things they ridiculously claim Donald Trump is going to do if he becomes president again.” The trouble is, Rubio doesn’t seem to recall Trump’s actual presidency. The former president’s critics aren’t just raising concerns about his future plans, they’re making accusations based on Trump’s unambiguous record. As we’ve discussed, the former president spent much of his White House tenure trying to transform Justice Department prosecutors into his own personal attack dogs. The New York Times reported in 2022 that Trump and his team “tried to turn the nation’s law enforcement apparatus into an instrument of political power” to carry out the Republican’s wishes. A Washington Post analysis published soon after highlighted the many instances in which Trump not only leaned on the Justice Department to follow his whims, but also his efforts to push federal law enforcement to validate the “big lie” in the wake of his election defeat. The Republican’s weaponization efforts reached a truly amazing pinnacle less than a month before Election Day 2020, when Trump publicly called on federal prosecutors to go after Joe Biden — at the time, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee who was leading the Republican incumbent in the polls — and accused him of undefined crimes. The then-president added that his future successor shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him. On Oct. 7, 2020, with early voting underway across much of the country, Politico published an especially memorable headline: “‘Where are all of the arrests?’: Trump demands Barr lock up his foes.” The next day, the Republican incumbent spoke with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo and called on the Justice Department to “indict” his perceived Democratic foes — including Biden. After Trump’s 2020 defeat, his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said the former president “regularly” wanted to use the Justice Department to retaliate against critics. To date, Rubio never expressed a word of criticism about any of this, and now the senator appears to have forgotten recent history altogether. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Right or wrong, Biden is the candidate Republicans want to face",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 9:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-election-candidate-republicans-want-face-2024-rcna160720,"In mid-January 2008, it was an open question as to who would win the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Republicans, however, had a preference. Writing at the time for National Review, Byron York reported on a Barack Obama campaign rally he attended in South Carolina with a Republican friend. Watching the candidate, seeing the crowd, and hearing the message, York’s Republican friend said at the time, “Oh, s--t.” The report added that some Republicans were hoping that Hillary Clinton would ultimately prevail because “running against the man on stage at the convention center would be a hard, hard campaign.” In other words, in 2008, Republicans took a long look at Obama and saw him as a formidable opponent. They were, for lack of a better word, scared that they just wouldn’t be able to defeat the Illinois Democrat — and those fears were proved true months later when Obama dispatched a popular and respected war hero with relative ease. Sixteen years later, it’s probably fair to say that Republicans aren’t scared at all of President Joe Biden. On the contrary, it appears their greatest fear is that the Democratic incumbent might be convinced to abandon his re-election plans. The Washington Post reported: They have plenty of company. Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump insisted last week that if Democrats were to choose a new nominee, it would be an affront to the democratic process. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina argued soon after that Biden’s refusal to withdraw is “very good news” not just for Trump, but also for “the entire down-ballot Republican team.” In case that weren’t quite enough, the far-right Heritage Foundation has indicated that it’s eyeing steps that would make it “extraordinarily difficult” for Democrats to replace Biden on the general election ballot. There’s no great mystery here. The political dynamic is not subtle. In the wake of the presidential debate 11 days ago, Republicans and their allies have come to believe that Biden would be easier to beat in November than the other possible Democratic contenders. It’s at this point when the incumbent president’s allies are likely saying, “Yeah, but Republicans might very well be wrong.” The benefit of this response is that it’s true. Not only does Trump have terrible political instincts, but the GOP has been wrong about questions like these plenty of times before. In fact, it’s not especially unusual for partisan players and operatives — folks with extensive experience in professional politics — to embrace all kinds of false assumptions. In October 2016, a striking number of Republicans concluded that there was simply no way Americans would elect Trump to the presidency after the “Access Hollywood” recording reached the public. Those conclusions were mistaken, and Trump won soon after. It’s entirely possible that many of these same GOP officials, certain that Biden is simply unelectable, are wrong again. But as Democrats weigh their options, the fact that Republicans appear even more excited about Biden’s candidacy than many in the president’s own party seems like a relevant detail."

"Despite reality, Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 8:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-election-project-2025-rcna160703,"In recent weeks, President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign and its allies set out to inform the public about Project 2025 — a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by The Heritage Foundation, with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. The Democratic incumbent’s campaign website created a page dedicated specifically to the governing blueprint and promoted it via social media in the hopes of getting the word out. The push caught on. Not only has it become more common to see “Google Project 2025” messages online, but as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones recently noted, the right-wing plan also became “the talk of the Black Entertainment Television Awards” after host Taraji P. Henson “made multiple references to it.” By Friday, it reached the point that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee decided to issue a brief statement about it by way of his social media platform: There are, of course, a few glaring problems with Trump’s pushback. The first is the flawed logic: On the one hand, the former president would have the public believe he doesn’t know anything about Project 2025. On the other hand, Trump believes some of the provisions in the right-wing document are “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” — suggesting he does know at least something about it. The second problem is that it’s impossible to take seriously. Popular Information’s Judd Legum published a detailed takedown on this, highlighting the lengthy list of people from Trump’s own team who co-authored the Project 2025 document. “I literally don’t have enough time to list every connection between Donald Trump and Project 2025,” MSNBC’s Ali Velshi told viewers over the weekend. “But I can absolutely confidently say that Donald Trump’s claim that he ‘knows nothing about Project 2025’ and has ‘no idea who is behind it’ is, how do we say it in Canada? Complete and utter BS.” But I’m also struck by the larger context: Trump wouldn’t have bothered to publish a denial unless he was concerned that Democrats’ focus on Project 2025 was gaining traction. In other words, the efforts to make Project 2025 a real campaign issue are having the intended effect, and it’s making the former president nervous."
"Biden pushes defiant message in letter to Dems, MSNBC appearance",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 7:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-pushes-defiant-message-letter-democrats-msnbc-appearance-rcna160688,"In the seven days following his awful debate performance, President Joe Biden adopted a low-key approach. He held no press conferences. He sat down for no major on-air interviews. He was slow to call his congressional allies. The incumbent Democrat appeared to be operating under a dubious assumption: The uproar would fade, the public conversation would shift, and the race would return to “normal.” If that was Biden’s assumption, it was a mistake: The number of Democratic lawmakers, officials and donors urging the president to withdraw from the race grew considerably as the incumbent waited for the story to blow over. And so, he’s clearly adopted a new posture. NBC News reported: “I’m getting so frustrated by the elites in the party. ... They know so much more,” Biden said, mockingly. “If any of these guys don’t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce for president — challenge me at the convention!” The incumbent added that he believes “average” Democratic voters want him to stay in the race — a conclusion he arrived at after some events in recent days with supporters. On the one hand, it was a clear message delivered in a high-energy way. On the other hand, it seemed far from ideal to see Biden chastising members of his own party, while complaining about Democratic “elites” — a label the experienced president was apparently applying to his longtime friends and governing partners. What’s more, it’s worth noting for context that recent polling suggests it’s not just folks attending cocktail parties in Georgetown who believe Biden should stand down. The call-in appearance on MSNBC dovetailed with a two-page letter sent to congressional Democrats in which Biden argued, among other things, that he won the party’s nominating contests. “We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively,” Biden wrote, referring to his primary and caucus victories. “The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,” he added. “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now,” the president’s letter went on to say. “And it’s time for it to end. ... Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task head only helps Trump and hurts us.” Biden’s strategy, in other words, is rooted in defiance. He’s not addressing the concerns of his intraparty critics, so much as he’s telling them that the conversation they’ve created is irrelevant: If the president isn’t going to end his candidacy, the argument goes, Democrats waiting for him to pass the torch shouldn’t waste everyone’s time with a pointless effort. This might work, but in my experience, members of Congress don’t like to effectively be told, “Shut up and stop talking about what you want to talk about.” As for the argument that Biden earned the nomination by way of his party’s nominating process, that’s true. Aside from American Samoa, the president cruised to lopsided victories in every Democratic primary and caucus. But I’m reminded of the 1980 election. In case anyone needs a refresher, in 1980, then-Sen. Ted Kennedy challenged then-President Jimmy Carter in a Democratic primary. As the process was just getting under way, the Iran hostage crisis broke, and Carter’s public support initially surged. The incumbent cruised to easy victories in nearly all of the early primaries and caucuses, mostly by wide margins. But as the nominating fight continued, and developments in Iran dragged on, public support for Carter’s handling of the crisis deteriorated. By the time the June primaries came along, Kennedy was in a vastly stronger position, and as the nominating process wrapped up, he closed out the calendar with several key wins, including a big victory in California. As the convention drew closer, Kennedy went to party officials with a compelling message rooted in fact: Democratic voters who backed Carter in January’s and February’s contests couldn’t have known what conditions would be like in June and July. It’s not that those contests didn’t count, so much as it was incumbent on the party to recognize the facts that weren’t available to primary and caucus voters months earlier. If Democrats had it to do over again, Kennedy argued, knowing what the crisis in Iran would do to the president’s national support, the results would have been much different. And while Kennedy was probably correct, his pitch didn’t work. Party officials stuck to the rules: Carter had earned a clear majority of the delegates, and so he would be the Democratic nominee. The incumbent soon after lost in a landslide, winning only 49 electoral votes. Biden’s absolutely right that he received the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination. But if the Democratic electorate had it to do over again, would they make a different choice?"
Hurricane Beryl's 'Armageddon-like' destruction also comes with scary timing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 4:55 PM PDT / Updated July 8, 2024, 7:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-beryl-jamaica-record-breaking-rcna160053,"UPDATE (July 8, 10:32 a.m. ET) Hurricane Beryl made landfall near the coastal town of Matagorda, Texas, about 85 miles south-southwest of Houston on the Gulf coast Monday morning. Sustained winds were 80 mph and the National Hurricane called the high winds and potential floods a life-threatening situation. Given the extreme weather we’re seeing across the country — flooding rains in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota, excessive heat warnings on the West Coast and in the south-central U.S. — the approach of a destructive Hurricane Beryl this early in the hurricane season doesn’t exactly come as a surprise. After all, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast the highest number of storms ever for the 2024 hurricane season: 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes. Still, Beryl, which had already killed at least seven people in the Caribbean as it approached Jamaica as a Category 4 storm Wednesday, is shocking for the records it has broken. Let's start with the fact that it became a hurricane on at 5 p.m. Saturday 720 miles east-southeast of Barbados, making it, according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher, the farthest east a hurricane has developed in the Atlantic in June. At 11:35 a.m. Sunday, when its winds hit 130 mph, Beryl made history as the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record. Then it became the earliest Category 5 and the strongest July hurricane we’ve ever seen. In Grenada, where at least three people were killed and many homes were destroyed, the prime minister called Beryl’s impact “Armageddon-like.” Though it had weakened somewhat as it approached Jamaica on Wednesday, on Tuesday it had maximum winds of 165 mph for at least six hours, beating the 160 mph record Emily set July 17, 2005. As a meteorologist who worked for 45 years in New Orleans, I certainly can’t forget hurricane season 2005. That’s the year hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit Louisiana, Hurricane Wilma hit the Florida Peninsula, and, for the first time, we had so many named storms that we exceeded the list of that year’s names and had to use six Greek letters to label the storms. That was the most active storm season we’d ever seen — until 2020, when we needed nine Greek letters. The storms that hit us are getting stronger, most likely because of warmer ocean temperatures. Look at Ida, Laura, Michael and Harvey as examples. In addition to that, they are developing rapidly. They can go from tropical depressions to major hurricanes inside three days. Hurricane Michael was a tropical depression on Oct. 7, 2018, and on Oct. 10 it made landfall at Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph. People who weren't paying attention to the changing forecast were caught off-guard. That’s why meteorologists always tell you to check on the forecast at least daily, because forecasts change quickly. That storms are rapidly intensifying before they make landfall is scary enough, but they’re also taking longer to diminish in intensity after they make landfall and causing major impacts well inland. Look at Hurricane Ida, which made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on Aug. 29, 2021, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. That’s scary enough. But Ida made landfall with winds of 150 mph. The previous year Hurricane Laura made landfall near Lake Charles, Louisiana, with 150 mph winds. Before then, you would have had to go back to 1856 to the Last Island Hurricane to find a storm with winds of 150 mph. Major hurricanes are happening more often now. They are also decreasing in intensity after landfall at a slower rate. Ida was still a Category 4 storm inland by Houma, and it was even at Category 2 on the opposite side of Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. Hurricane Laura, which landed in 2020 as a Category 4 storm at Cameron, Louisiana, maintained hurricane strength almost as far north as Shreveport and entered Arkansas as a tropical storm. I suggest that when people see a National Hurricane Center forecast, they plan as if a storm one category higher in strength will actually hit. That guidance is especially important for people along our Gulf Coast to keep in mind. Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said in a statement, “While Texans take time to enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends, it’s important to stay weather aware, pay close attention to the rapidly-changing forecasts, and don’t be caught without an emergency plan.” NOAA predicted such an awful 2024 hurricane season because all the ingredients are there or are expected to be there: Hot sea surface temperatures. An Active West African monsoon. No El Niño and La Niña, which we associate with an absence of wind shear that might tear tropical systems apart, forecast to develop during the August-October peak of hurricane season. What we’ve seen from Beryl supports that forecast. Klotzbach says that when early-season storm activity occurs in the tropics east of longitude 75 west, it tends to be a harbinger of a very busy season. Why is Beryl in particular so bad? Water temperatures are “crunk.” That’s another word for extreme. In this case, the water is hotter than it has ever been at this time of the year. In fact, these are the water temperatures we normally see in September. Water temperatures are running about 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius above normal, and warm water is the fuel for tropical development. Beryl encountered the perfect environment: warm water, moisture through the atmosphere and little wind shear. Beryl was also small with a small, well-organized inner core. Small storms can intensify faster and take advantage of those conditions. In short, Beryl was the perfect storm. And it has been almost mesmerizing to me, as a meteorologist, at least, to watch the satellite loop of Beryl intensifying over the west Atlantic into the Caribbean. That having been said, Beryl will have major impacts on Jamaica. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a video statement Tuesday, “If you live in a low-lying area, an area that is historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river ... I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground.” This is where we are one month into hurricane season. So far, we have had tropical storms Alberto and Chris and Beryl and a major hurricane, Beryl. And what’s scary is that we aren’t even in the active part of the season yet. I’ve known a lot of hurricanes: Betsy, Camille, Charley, Ivan, Katrina, Ike, Laura, Delta, Zeta, Ida and all the ones in between. I’ve seen relatively inactive seasons that had major hurricanes — like Andrew in 1992. I’ve seen active hurricane seasons that had no impacts on my area, as was the case last year. Active seasons don't tell us where a hurricane will hit. Active seasons mean that statistically there is a greater chance of impact. But with my experience, when I see early major development as with Beryl this year, I get concerned.  "
"Comer, GOP colleagues breathe new life into anti-Biden crusade",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 6:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/james-comer-gop-republicans-biden-election-2024-rcna160668,"The House Republicans’ impeachment crusade against President Joe Biden isn’t technically over — the GOP lawmakers behind the gambit haven’t officially pulled the plug — but it’s no secret that the entire effort was an embarrassing failure for the Democrat’s opponents. Indeed, the whole endeavor made Republicans look far worse than their intended target. As recently as a couple of months ago, among GOP officials on Capitol Hill, there was a grudging realization: Biden may or may not be brought down in 2024, but either way, the hapless Republican investigations were a pointless distraction that have had no meaningful impact on the election cycle. GOP crusaders were left to lick their wounds and fight amongst themselves over why they failed — right up until the first presidential debate 11 days ago, at which point congressional Republicans breathed new life into their campaign against Biden. NBC News reported overnight: I’m skeptical this will amount to much — the president’s physician appears to be little more than a new toy for GOP lawmakers to play with after they broke their earlier playthings — but what’s notable about Comer’s letter is the degree to which it’s part of a larger flurry of activity. 25th Amendment: After the debate, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the White House cabinet should explore invoking the 25th Amendment and ending Biden’s presidency. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina made related comments, and Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas went so far as to introduce a formal House resolution on the matter. More impeachment: In addition to his 25th Amendment resolution, Roy last week raised the prospect of impeaching Vice President Kamala Harris for, as the Texan argued, covering for Biden. Select committee: Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida told Fox News last week that there should “absolutely” be a congressional investigation into the president’s health, and soon after, Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana also told Fox News that he’s “all for“ the creation of a new House select committee that would focus entirely on Biden’s fitness for office. The point, of course, is not that these endeavors are serious. They are not. But after the impeachment effort flopped, GOP members were looking for something new to do in the hopes of undermining the Democratic ticket, and the presidential debate apparently got the party’s creative juices flowing. What’s more, this list is likely to grow in unpredictable ways as members return to Capitol Hill today following a two-week break. Watch this space."
"Ahead of elections, job growth continues to exceed expectations",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elections-jobs-economy-trump-biden-2024-rcna160662,"Expectations heading into Friday morning’s unemployment data showed projections of about 190,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in June. As it turns out, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market managed to do a bit better than that. NBC News reported: In addition to the encouraging top-line data, we also learned that wage growth continued to outpace inflation. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, inched a little higher in the new report, climbing to 4.1% from 4%, which obviously isn’t ideal, though the figure is still incredibly low in historical terms. Nevertheless, what matters most about the latest report is the overall job creation totals. I’m mindful of polls showing a discouraged public, but over 1.3 million jobs have been created so far this year, and if this pace keeps up, the United States will see roughly 2.7 million new jobs this year, which is excellent. As for the politics, let’s circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump’s presidency — when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet — the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018 and 2019. According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16 million jobs since January 2021 — more than double the combined total of Trump’s first three years. In recent months, Republicans have responded to developments like these by pretending not to notice them. Not surprisingly, GOP officials kept the trend going late last week. For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions: 2013: 2.3 million 2014: 3 million 2015: 2.7 million 2016: 2.3 million 2017: 2.1 million 2018: 2.3 million 2019: 1.98 million 2020: -9.3 million 2021: 7.2 million 2022: 4.5 million 2023: 3 million Six months into 2024: 1.33 million This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Biden’s post-debate strategy falters, more Dems call for a change",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bidens-post-debate-strategy-democrats-election-2024-rcna160659,"In the aftermath of his troubled debate performance a week and a half ago, it stood to reason that President Joe Biden and his team would turn to the Crisis Management 101 playbook. It was widely assumed that the Democratic incumbent would quickly arrange a press conference or two, blanket the airwaves, and engage in furious outreach to members of Congress and major donors. For the most part, that’s not what happened — at least not in the first week after the debate. Much of the pushback strategy focused on an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, which aired eight days after the debate, and which did little to silence those who are eager to see the president pass the torch. As a Politico report summarized as the holiday weekend got underway, “For years, Joe Biden’s team has responded to a storm of bad news with a tried and true approach: hunker down, ignore the chattering class and weather the storm.” And while this approach has been effective in the past, the report added, “[A]mid the wreckage of his disastrous debate performance — and the much bigger questions it raises about his health, his White House’s candor and his ability to effectively make the case against Donald Trump — that approach just isn’t cutting it this time.” To be sure, the president appears keenly aware of the larger conversation, and he’s taken steps to try to shut it down. Indeed, Biden has declared categorically that he would not, barring divine intervention, withdraw from the 2024 race. The message to his intraparty critics seemed obvious: There’s no point in speculating further, he effectively declared, because he would remain atop the Democratic ticket. That message is not having its intended effect. NBC News reported overnight that four additional congressional Democrats told their colleagues during a Sunday phone meeting that they believe Biden should step aside. They join an existing group of Democrats who’d already made similar public declarations. Stepping back, Team Biden is clearly facing a multifaceted problem: Withdrawal calls: The number of congressional Democrats who want Biden to end his re-election campaign is growing steadily, and as members return to Capitol Hill for the first time in two weeks, it’s very likely that the list is poised to grow longer in the coming days. Other vocal critics: Plenty of other prominent Democratic voices have come close to calling for his withdrawal, and have done so in ways that add to the pressure on the president. See, for example, Rep. Adam Schiff’s comments on “Meet the Press” yesterday. Commentators: Biden might not care about the “chattering class,” but when leading voices such as The Washington Post’s E.J. Dionne, among many others, call on the president to stand down, it affects the public conversation in ways that make matters worse for the incumbent. Donors: Presidential campaigns are extraordinarily expensive, and as Biden’s fundraising advantage over Trump vanishes, some leading Democratic donors are ready to close their wallets unless Biden is replaced atop the ticket. A pre-convention “blitz”? Last week, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime Biden ally, raised the prospect of a “mini-primary” process for other would-be Democratic nominees — a Semafor report referred to it as a “blitz primary“ — and the idea has received support from some donors and observers, as evidenced by Ezra Klein’s latest New York Times column. I haven’t the foggiest idea how such a process would work, but the conversation is itself emblematic of Biden’s larger problem. We’ll know soon enough what the president and his party decide to do next, but the status quo — every day, the pressure gets a little worse as more Democrats urge Biden to call it a day — appears untenable.

‘Some folks need killing’: North Carolina Lt. Gov takes Christian nationalism to dangerous low,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mark-robinson-north-carolina-killing-trump-rcna160433,"On the Sunday before the Fourth of July, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, stood on a church pulpit and called for the extrajudicial killing of people he considered to be enemies of Christian America. Republicans’ continued support for and promotion of Robinson’s candidacy show how the GOP and the religious right have mainstreamed calls for violence in the name of Christian nationalism. The address — first reported by The New Republic’s Greg Sargent — was part of “God and Country Sunday” at Lake Church in White Lake, North Carolina. “We now find ourselves struggling with people who have evil intent,” Robinson declared, adding that “some folks need killing. … It’s a matter of necessity!” He compared these supposed enemies on the American left to Nazis in World War II: “We didn’t argue and capitulate and talk about, ‘Well, maybe we shouldn’t fight the Nazis that hard.’ No, they’re bad. Kill them.” And the state’s would-be governor had no qualms about marshaling state power: “Time to call out, uh, those guys in green and go have them handle it. Or those boys in blue and have them go handle it.” The exact identity of the “folks” who deserved death was unclear. There are “wicked people doing wicked things, torturing and murdering and raping,” Robinson said. But he clearly had in mind a far broader spectrum of leftist foes, warning about those “making 1776 a distant memory” and those advancing “the tenets of socialism and communism.” Cameron McGill, the church’s pastor, defended Robinson. “Without a doubt, those he deemed worthy of death [were] those seeking to kill us,” McGill told The New Republic, claiming that Robinson “certainly did not imply the taking of any innocent lives.” The pastor, in other words, gave Robinson his permission to deem some fellow citizens “worthy of death” based only on conspiratorial lies that such people want to kill Christians. Robinson, an unabashed Christian nationalist, has a long history of extremist and bigoted positions, promoting conspiracy theories, and making racist, antisemitic, homophobic and transphobic attacks on fellow Americans. He launched his political career by attacking gun control and ridiculing survivors of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He has expressed support for the 1970 National Guard shooting of anti-Vietnam War protesters at Kent State University, denied the Holocaust and called for trans women to be arrested for using women’s restrooms. Robinson’s supporters on the Christian right treat his vicious, bigoted attacks as evidence of his heroic stands against “woke” enemies of Christian America. The church introduced Robinson, who was fresh off an appearance at the Road to Majority conference hosted by the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Washington, D.C., with a clip of his appearance at this high-profile event for Republican heavyweights, including former President Donald Trump. In the segment, Robinson attacked the media as anti-American, saying, “I don’t care about your plans and your schemes to bring this nation down, with your Democratic friends. Why? Because Jesus Christ is still on the throne!” In a friendly interview between McGill and Robinson before the candidate gave his speech, the pair reiterated Christian nationalist dogma that the founders intended America to be a Christian nation, and that the separation of church and state was intended to protect the church from government interference, but not to stop the church from influencing government. “You cannot tell me we can separate our government from the laws of God, from the Bible,” said Robinson. “Our Constitution is based on the word of God, I don’t care what anybody says.” At one point in the interview, McGill told Robinson that he has an “anointing.” With that endorsement, Robinson took to the pulpit for his speech. This is far from the first time Robinson has used the violent language of warfare to pit MAGA Republicans like himself against others. In 2021, he said in a speech that he was born “to be one of God’s freedom fighters” in order to “literally make war on the devil.” He warned he wanted to make “the literal foundations of hell tremble, and I want this nation to join with me in doing it.” That same year, Robinson said in another speech that Christians and conservatives must “get as bold and unafraid and warlike in spreading the truth in this nation as these people have been in spreading the lies that are currently destroying it.” But in those instances, Robinson stopped short of endorsing murder. Explicitly advocating for supposed “enemies” of Christian America to be killed — on a church pulpit, no less — is a clear and dangerous escalation of Christian nationalist support for “spiritual warfare” against “demonic” enemies. Many promoters of “spiritual warfare” have long insisted, citing Ephesians 6:12, that they are not talking about actual war with “flesh and blood,” but rather a battle against “principalities and powers” that takes place solely in the realm of spirituality and prayer. Yet Robinson’s newly explicit calls for killing perceived enemies show just how seamlessly Christian nationalist extremists can glide into promoting real violence. Trump wanted to shoot racial justice protesters in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd in 2020. Robinson, who could be North Carolina’s next governor, wants to get “the guys in green” or the “boys in blue” to “handle” unspecified “wicked people.” It’s all part of the MAGA quest to upend democracy and replace it with far-right authoritarianism. Robinson is merely taking the lead on turning this project into a twisted Sunday school lesson for Christian nationalists."
The Roberts Court has checkmated the other branches,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-john-roberts-chevron-immunity-rcna160448,"Chief Justice John Roberts likes to present himself as an institutionalist, concerned with upholding the legacy of the Supreme Court. He has positioned himself as the voice of reason on a court that has swung steadily to the right since he was first confirmed to the role almost two decades ago. But this term, he authored a series of decisions that completely shattered the previous balance of power within the federal system. In opinions that on the surface show deference to Congress and the president, Roberts has managed to consolidate an unprecedented amount of power in the only branch of government that is entirely unelected. Roberts’ opinions in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Trump v. United States fundamentally reject one of the key premises of the constitutional order. If you’re an American reading this, you likely remember learning in school how the three branches of government — the legislative, executive and judiciary — operate through a separation of powers that distributes different parts of governing among them. A series of checks and balances prevents any one from assuming too much authority over the others. In the first case, Loper Bright, Roberts has pantomimed a defense of the former principle while completely ignoring the latter. Previously, under the Chevron v. NRDC decision from 1982, courts were instructed to defer to executive branch agencies’ “reasonable interpretation” of imprecise or ambiguous statutes. This precedent was crucial, given the difficulties of drafting perfectly precise statutes, the broad sweep of many laws on the books, and the amount of power Congress has delegated to these agencies to figure out the details. In overturning Chevron, Roberts stripped that deference from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Trade Commission, curtailing their ability to issue regulations and increasing the odds of those standards being challenged in lawsuits. Roberts claimed the court was returning authority from agency bureaucrats back to the elected members of Congress who write the laws. (Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch went further in their concurring opinions, explicitly claiming that Chevron was a violation of the separation of powers that was now being rectified.) In practice, as MSNBC contributor Steve Vladeck pointed out, there is no realistic way for even the most productive Congress to pass clarifying legislation relating to every detail of every agency’s work. “The reality, then, is that the only transfer of power the Supreme Court accomplished by overruling Chevron is a transfer of power to the courts,” wrote Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “After all, it is now going to be up to judges to decide what each and every statute agencies enforce means.” In contrast, Roberts’ opinion in Trump v. United States at first seems to empower the executive branch with its declaration that “official acts” taken within the president’s “core constitutional functions” have absolute immunity from prosecution. But while the decision elevates the president and inoculates the office from accountability, Trump v. U.S. nevertheless siphons power away from the executive branch broadly toward the judiciary. In doing so, Roberts at times treats the presidency as utterly separate from the machinery that acts with the executive’s authority, producing a yawning gap between the office of the president and the rest of the executive branch’s functions. Bear in mind that federal prosecutors in the cases against Trump are doing so as the enforcement mechanism of the executive branch, acting through the president’s authority. This relationship is why it was absurd for Trump to attempt to cite executive privilege during the Department of Justice’s investigations, as it exists on the same side of the separation of powers as the White House. The immunity decision likewise stressed that the president has “exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials.” And yet that same ruling has bound those officers of the executive from enforcing federal laws at the highest level when the president is acting with the greatest amount of power at his disposal, and thus the greatest opportunities for criminality. Then there are the acts on the “outer perimeter” of the president’s role where “presumptive immunity” exists, meaning the standard of proof falls on the prosecution, not the defense, to overcome it. Notably, there is no indication in Roberts’ opinion that Congress could overturn this standard by passing laws that strictly delineate what counts as unlawful behavior from the president. I can only assume that Roberts would likely see this as another violation of the separation of powers if it were attempted. Instead, it is again only through the courts that this immunity can be rebuked and a prosecution allowed to proceed. We are left then with a Congress unable to act as a check on the Supreme Court due to self-imposed restrictions, both on its legislative role via the filibuster and hyperpartisanship, and as part of a similar unhealthy fetishization of the separation of powers that dissuades it from conducting oversight. On the other hand, we have a presidency where it is only the better angels of the officeholder’s nature that prevent tyranny from taking root. Roberts seems confident in the courts’ ability to hold off this fate, but to paraphrase a likely apocryphal quote, I would like to know how many army divisions the justices command. There is no reason that the courts should have accrued this much power, an imbalance completely antithetical to the role the founders envisioned the third branch playing. It is also ironically a more dangerous form of “lawmaking from the bench” that the conservative legal movement once accused liberals of pursuing. Through its decisions, the Roberts court has gone far beyond what the early adherents of that movement, with its backlash to the liberalism of the Warren court, could have plotted. It also feels fitting that this is the fate of a campaign that began as a call for judges to follow “originalism” and “textualism” in their decisions. Rather than merely being content to erase their predecessors’ gains, Roberts and his fellow conservatives have now rewritten the Constitution’s words to map out their own power-hungry ideology. In doing so, they have eliminated any check that the other branches might have over them, and deeply imperiled the country in the process."

The surprising efforts to oppose the Nazi war crimes trials, and advocate for individual Nazis at home and abroad, will involve some of the most high-profile voices on the American right, and will jumpstart the career of one rising Republican star, Sen. Joseph McCarthy. (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rachel Maddow: The cartoon appeared on the front page, right in the middle, above the fold. Reporter: Already we are having sentences passed, passed on the defendants who were found guilty this morning. Maddow: It’s the day after the Nuremberg verdicts, in October 1946. The surviving leadership of the Nazi regime has been convicted of war crimes. Many of them sentenced to death. Judge: On account of the indictment on which you have been convicted, the tribunal sentences you to death by hanging. Maddow: The cartoon that appeared on the front page of the newspaper right after those verdicts showed a Nazi soldier standing on top of a makeshift pedestal. And on the pedestal, it says, quote, German martyr. Below that, it says, Nazi criminal convicted by a biased court composed of Germany’s enemies in an illegally conducted trial upon unlawful evidence illicitly procured. It’s the day after the Nuremberg verdicts, and on the front page of this newspaper, the convicted Nazis are martyrs. The publication that ran that cartoon on the front page that day, it was not a German newspaper. It was not some old Nazi paper somehow still being published over there. No, this was the Chicago Tribune. According to the front page of the Chicago Tribune right after the Nuremberg verdicts are announced, when the Nazi war criminals are convicted, among other things, for orchestrating the Holocaust, on the front page of the Tribune, those Nazis are the martyrs. And the real crime here is the fact that the allies put the Nazis on trial at all. The Chicago Tribune in the 1930s and 1940s was a goliath. It was one of the most widely read newspapers in the whole country. Every edition of the paper featured an American flag at the top, with the tagline, An American Paper for Americans. And the paper had an unmistakable editorial bent. Announcer: You have just heard Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune. Maddow: Robert R. McCormick had inherited this important newspaper from his grandfather and his father. He was an intimidating 6 foot 4. He was very, very, very sure of his own brilliance. His politics were sometimes described as Republican but it was probably closer to the mark to call them reactionary. One critic famously said that Robert McCormick had quote, the greatest mind of the 14th century. In the 1920s, McCormick’s Chicago Tribune editorials repeatedly praised Mussolini, saying quote, dictatorships frequently are constructive and we can use that sort of government here. When Rhode Island named what he considered to be too many Democrats as judges, McCormick ordered that one star, the star representing Rhode Island, should be physically ripped out of the American flag in the Chicago Tribune’s lobby. He only relented on that one after being told that mutilating the flag was a federal crime. Under Robert McCormick, the Chicago Tribune called an African American murder suspect a quote, “jungle beast” and pointed to the darkness of his skin tone to suggest, explicitly, that he might not be fully human. McCormick and his newspaper picked all kinds of fights. McCormick: The Senator asks if Al Capone was at one time on the Tribune’s payroll. Al Capone was never on the Tribune’s payroll. Maddow: As a business, the Chicago Tribune under Robert McCormick was repeatedly accused of gangster tactics against its competitors. Robert McCormick: I will say that the senator’s statements were without basis in fact. And in particular that Mr. Annenberg did not ever shoot or shoot at an officer or employee of a competing newspaper. Maddow: That was Robert McCormick. And by the 1940s, his big, pugnacious, controversial newspaper was the beating heart of the American right. McCormick: We have chosen to fight New Deal communism. Maddow: McCormick and his Chicago Tribune were vocal critics of FDR, of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They were vocal supporters of the America First Committee, which tried to stop America from joining the war against the Nazis. America First rally speaker: I only wish there were more Americans in the United States of America that loved America First. Maddow: Once the war had been fought and won by America and its allies, McCormick and his very profitable, very influential paper decided to take up a strange new hobbyhorse, a new cause, sympathy for Nazi war criminals. Anchor: History wrote a new page in responsibility for making war today as the war crimes trial of 20 former top Nazi and German military leaders opened at Nuremberg. Maddow: The Chicago Tribune argued vociferously, repeatedly against prosecuting the Nazis. One Easter Sunday, the Tribune editorialized that the Nuremberg trial was so corrupt it would have quote, gagged Pontius Pilate. And the Tribune was not alone in this effort. Republican Congressman Clare Hoffman of Michigan had been a loud, proud member of the America First movement.  Rep. Clare Hoffman: Unless we adhere strictly to these provisions in the Constitution, we’ll have a dictator right here in Washington. In fact, we almost have one now.  Maddow: When Americans, during the war, were put on trial for sedition, for working with the Nazis, Clare Hoffman was one of the congressmen who came to their defense and criticized the trial. Now, after the war, he was railing against putting the German Nazi leadership on trial as well. But it was more than just the right wing juggernaut Chicago Tribune and far right congressmen like Clare Hoffman. Announcer: Distinguished United States Senator from the state of Ohio, the Honorable Robert Taft. (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Senator Robert Taft was such a titan of Republican politics, his nickname was Mr. Republican. He was the son of Republican President William Howard Taft. He was expected by many people to be president himself one day. Senator Taft had also been among the members of Congress who had railed against the sedition trial during the war.  Then after the war, Taft also launched a very public crusade against Nuremberg. Taft started giving speeches saying that prosecution was not derived from quote, Anglo-Saxon heritage. He said it was motivated by a spirit of vengeance. He said America would long regret its involvement in prosecuting Nazis for war crimes. And as strange as that sounds today because America by and large does not regret its involvement in prosecuting Nazis, that line of argument actually came off a little strange then too. President Harry Truman said he would have no comment on these Republicans making such a big show of opposing the prosecution of Nazis. But he no commented it with such a look of satisfaction on his face that it got a big round of laughter from reporters in the White House press corps. But as crazy as their arguments seemed, morally and honestly politically, this idea did take hold in part of the Republican Party. And they were willing to push through the initial negative response to it because it was important to them, this argument. That the Nazis were being unfairly persecuted by the United States, both our pro-Nazi groups over here, and the actual German Nazis over there. It was our government that was the bad guy. With that case to make, as unpopular and as radical as it was, things were about to get weird in Washington. And two very different politicians were about to be set on a fatal collision course. This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Announcer: You’re about to hear an address delivered before a meeting of the America First Committee in Madison Square Garden in New York City. John Jackson: Most of these people were fascists, were aligned with the fascist cause. Anchor: Today’s guest, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Steven Remy: What he wanted was an investigation. The problem was he did not know what he was talking about. ******************************** Maddow: Episode 4, Spectacle. Speaker: I present to you a great American, Colonel Charles Lindbergh. (CROWD CHEERING) Maddow: Ahead of World War II, the famous American pilot Charles Lindbergh had led the America First Committee, arguing that we weren’t at any risk in this war, that we shouldn’t join it, that we would lose the war if we did. Charles Lindbergh: We are on the verge of a war for which we are still unprepared against armies stronger than our own. Maddow: When America was attacked and America did join the war, that put Lindbergh and his organization in a tough spot. The America First Committee formally disbanded itself just after the Pearl Harbor attack. Lindbergh himself even briefly attempted to re-enlist in the military. But once we were in the war, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reported to the White House that even though America First had officially dissolved, some of the group’s leadership kept meeting during the war in secret. In his words, they had gone underground. FBI files record that at one of their underground meetings in New York, Lindbergh told the group that they should quote, keep on the alert and be ready to reemerge, because soon the American people would see how they’d been betrayed by their own government. In other words, these guys were still expecting us to lose the war to Hitler and the Nazis. Whereupon, they were planning to reemerge as the Americans who would work things out with Hitler. They thought they would be the ones to make the arrangements for America’s surrender. A negotiated peace with the Nazis. Had the war gone that way, who knows? Maybe they might have. But things didn’t go that way. America won the war. Where did that leave members of the America First movement? Many America First lawmakers were voted out of office after they were implicated in the huge Nazi propaganda scheme in Congress that had involved some of the defendants in the great Sedition Trial during the war. Newsreel Announcer: Sedition trial opens in Washington. Maddow: Some lawmakers like Congressman Clare Hoffman were even hauled in to testify to the grand jury in that case. Newsreel Announcer: Thirty in all charged with scheming to establish a Nazi government in the United States. Maddow: But despite their participation in that conspiracy to push Nazi propaganda through Congress and feed it to the American people, no criminal charges were ever brought against any members of Congress for that. We just let it be and moved on.  And so a bunch of powerful forces and figures who’d been involved in America First before the war, they got to work on this brand new project after the war, coming to the defense of the now-defeated Nazis. Here’s historian John Jackson. Jackson: Henry Regnery was part of the isolationist crowd before World War II. Maddow: Henry Regnery was a prominent member of the America First Committee before the war. He was from a very rich family. His father had co-founded and funded America First. Henry Regnery, the son, helped found a right wing magazine called Human Events.  Reporter: The war crimes trial of 20 former top Nazi and German military leaders opened at Nuremberg. Maddow: Just one day after the Nuremberg trial started, the magazine railed against that prosecution as a quote, travesty of justice. Regnery then launched his own conservative publishing company, which is still around to this day. The first books he published argued that the Nazis were being treated very unfairly, that the supposed atrocities committed by the Nazi regime were really no worse than what anyone else did. Jackson: He was searching around for authors who would make that case, that equivalent sort of atrocities were committed by the allies as the axis powers. The problem was most of these people that Regnery publishes in the late 40s, early 50s were fascists, were aligned with the fascist cause, with Hitler’s cause. Maddow: It’s one thing to be opposed to the Nuremberg trials on legal grounds, to be wary of the idea of any sort of ad-hoc post-war legal proceeding. There were definitely some people making those good faith arguments at the time, right, left, and center. But you could tell when it was something else, when it wasn’t just the defeated Nazis overseas that they were taking up for. It was for our Nazis here at home as well. Newsreel Announcer: American justice returned a verdict of guilty in the trial of William Dudley Pelley, Silver Shirts leader.  Maddow: The defendants in the Great Sedition Trial had mostly been freed after their case ended in a mistrial. But by the time the war was over, there was one of them still behind bars. William Dudley Pelley. Bradley Hart: He wants to build an American version of fascism. Maddow: That’s historian Bradley Hart. Hart: Pelley’s people were ready to rise up and fight on behalf of the Nazis domestically. And he -- he really didn’t even conceal the fact that that was what he had in mind. Maddow: Pelley was the founder of the Silver Shirts, which was an antisemitic, pro-Nazi, armed militia in the United States before World War II. He repeatedly ran into legal trouble for fraud, for grifting and conning his own supporters. But Pelley ended up in prison for most of the war, specifically for his conviction for plotting to overthrow the U.S. government. Hart: This is a -- a group that -- that I think is a very serious national security threat. I mean there’s really no veneer of this being in any way, interested in anything other than -- than violence and political revolution. Maddow: It’s hard to imagine a less appealing political poster child than William Dudley Pelley. Hart: He actually says outright, I intend to overthrow the U.S. government. He’s open about these objectives. Maddow: But at the end of World War II, there was a groundswell of support among the old America First movement to free Pelley, to spring him from prison. The campaign was led by the Chicago Tribune, which began editorializing in favor of getting Pelley paroled. They published letters describing Pelley as a political prisoner. His cause was also taken up by America First members of Congress. Announcer: Tonight from Washington, D. C., you are to hear an address by the Honorable William Langer, twice Governor and now Republican Senator from North Dakota. Maddow: During the war, Republican Senator Bill Langer had turned up at the courthouse in D.C. to show off his support for the defendants in the Sedition Trial. Announcer: The pick of the bunch of pro-Hitlerites is Mrs. Lois de Lafayette Washburn, who rips off a Nazi salute -- Maddow: He sang their praises on the Senate floor. He helped arrange their legal defense. After the war was over, Langer took up the cause of getting parole for William Dudley Pelley, for this fascist leader. He made a personal visit to the federal prison in Indiana where Pelley was serving his sentence. When Pelley was denied parole, Langer introduced a Senate resolution to look into why it was that Pelley was being persecuted so unfairly. After pressure from Langer and other Republican members of Congress and from the Chicago Tribune and other parts of the conservative press, William Dudley Pelley did get parole. They got him out. Along the way that campaign to free him attracted the support of one young up-and-coming member of the United States Senate. A new Republican senator from the state of Wisconsin. Anchor: Today’s guest, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Maddow: Joe McCarthy was in his first term. He had just been elected to the Senate after unseating a longtime popular incumbent. After that upset victory, one of the first things McCarthy did was run to Chicago to go kiss the ring of Chicago Tribune publisher, Robert McCormick. Then McCarthy got to work in the Senate, aligning himself with some of the Tribune’s pet causes. Like parole for American fascist leader William Dudley Pelley, like opposition to the Nuremberg prosecution of high-ranking Nazis. McCarthy described Nuremberg as a quote, sorry spectacle. And then McCarthy jumped headlong into what would become a brand new crusade. It had to do with one of the most notorious crimes against American soldiers in the whole war. Reporter: The military court of Dachau in Germany has just finished that trial of Hitler’s SS men who were charged with the slaughter of American prisoners at Malmedy in Belgium. Maddow: The Malmedy Massacre, the Nazi soldiers who had carried out the Malmedy Massacre of unarmed American POWs, they had been put on trial and convicted and sentenced. In the wake of their convictions though, the convicts and their Nazi lawyer had cooked up an elaborate false story that they had all been tortured, horribly mistreated by Jewish investigators and interrogators in the U. S. Army. Here’s historian Steven Remy. Remy: That they had had limbs broken, that they had been assaulted, that their testicles had been damaged, that bones had been broken. It was very graphic. Maddow: The claims were very graphic. They were also very false. The men who initially made these false claims admitted they were false. Their defense lawyer at trial admitted they were false. And they’d been proven baseless by no fewer than four separate American reviews of the case. Remy: They all conclude that there was no torture. Maddow: But for the convicted men and their Nazi supporters inside Germany, these false claims about them having been tortured, it served their direct purpose of trying to overturn their convictions and get out of jail. Remy: German lawyers were feeding these stories of torture to really any American who would listen. Maddow:  It also served a larger purpose, portraying the Nazis as the real persecuted victims, and hopefully monkeywrenching the whole process of holding Nazis accountable for their crimes. What American would want to be part of that, would want to help with that? Remy: One of those was the McCormick family’s Chicago Daily Tribune. Maddow: The Chicago Tribune. Remy: The torture stories were headline getters. Maddow: The Tribune ran detailed stories with all of these graphic allegations about how those Malmedy Massacre defendant Nazi officers had been tortured by Americans. So did the conservative New York Daily News, the sister paper of the Chicago Tribune, run by Robert McCormick’s cousin.  These outlets breathlessly, credulously reported about Malmedy defendants who had suffered broken jaws and broken arms, permanently injured organs, burning matches driven under their fingernails. They had no evidence to support any of this. Remy: These were very serious accusations of extreme forms of physical and psychological abuse. They did nothing to confirm the accusations. They presented them as factual. Maddow: Not too far behind was Regnery Publishing, which began putting out books about how terrible and evil the American interrogators had been to those poor Nazi SS officers in the Malmedy trial. The America First movement may have lost the fight to keep America from going to war against the Nazis in the first place but this was kind of their next project, accelerating these false claims about evil Americans and innocent Nazis. The people pushing this hoax would find the most help among sympathetic members of Congress. Remy: A small number of American congressmen start picking up on this story. Maddow: That included Republican Senator Bill Langer, fresh off his efforts to free fascist militia leader William Dudley Pelley. Langer started promoting these baseless torture claims, including all the horror movie details the Nazis had invented to try to really sell the story. Like for example, the guy who said he had the burning matchsticks shoved under his fingernails. Not only was that proven to be false, but that guy was never even in prison with the Malmedy defendants. Remy: Now, Langer is very confused. He presented a highly distorted account of what supposedly had gone on during the investigation and the trial. Maddow: This was propaganda manufactured inside Germany, pushed by well connected operators who were trying, among other things, to return Nazism to power there. In the United States Congress, there was a select group that was more than willing to repeat that stuff, to give it their personal stamp of validation. It was the exact same play the Nazis had run with their favorite members of Congress before the war. Now here it was again. Joining the chorus on Malmedy was Bill Langer’s new wingman in the Senate, young Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy. Remy: McCarthy, at that time, was relatively unknown, a still relatively unknown junior senator. Maddow: Joe McCarthy was a fairly unremarkable, under the radar Republican senator. He had taken down a big name in order to get himself into the Senate though. And now that he was there, he saw an opportunity to make a big name for himself. Remy: He was looking for a way to raise his visibility, and he caught wind of the Malmedy case. Maddow: McCarthy had a sizable German American population back home in Wisconsin. He also had a particular German American to whom he paid lots of extra attention. It was his largest donor, someone who not only supported McCarthy’s campaign, he’d also personally bailed McCarthy out by posting collateral for the senator when he fell into financial trouble early in his Senate career. He was a businessman whose company had been in trouble under FDR for advertising that it only wanted job applicants if they were white and gentile. When the Nazi propaganda hoax about the supposed torture of the Malmedy defendants started to make news in the United States, McCarthy’s big donor told the senator that he was sending a lawyer from his own company in Wisconsin to Washington to go work in McCarthy’s office specifically on that issue. McCarthy, at that point, looking to make a splash, hoping to get some press, trying to curry favor, both back home and with right wing kingmaker publications like the Chicago Tribune, he had started repeating these baseless claims that Nazi officers had been the victims of abuse and torture at the hands of vengeful, mostly Jewish American G.I.’s. Remy: He read in a very cursory way some of the torture stories and he accepted them at face value. The problem was he did not know what he was talking about. Maddow: McCarthy said that he had important information indicating that the actions of the Americans involved was quote, more than improper. His partner on this in the Senate, Bill Langer, described the Malmedy case as shocking. He said it was one of the most deplorable miscarriages of justice in history. Remy: What he wanted was an investigation. He wanted one of the committees of the Senate to carry out an investigation of the whole sordid affair. Maddow: Bill Langer and Joe McCarthy wanted an official Senate investigation of these allegations. And that is what they got. By echoing and amplifying these false Nazi torture claims, they got the Senate Armed Services Committee to agree to formally look into it. The investigation would be chaired by Republican Senator Raymond Baldwin of Connecticut, along with Democratic Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, and also a young freshman senator who had only been sworn into the Senate a few months earlier, Democratic Senator Lester Hunt. This investigation was his first major assignment as a new senator. McDaniel: Well, he was one of the three members of the committee, quite a -- quite a coup for a freshman. He had been in the Senate only a couple of months. Maddow: Baldwin, Kefauver, and Hunt. Those were the three senators who would look into these allegations. At least that was the plan. Senator Joe McCarthy had other ideas. McDaniel: That was Lester Hunt’s introduction to Joe McCarthy and it was -- it was quite ugly. Maddow: That’s next. ******************************** McDaniel: Lester Hunt had been in the Senate only a couple of months when the Senate decided it would investigate the Malmedy massacre. Maddow: It’s his first major assignment in Washington as a brand new U. S. Senator. Reporter: One of the prosecutors of the Nazi stormtroopers sentenced for their role in the Malmedy massacre has been invited to testify before the Senate committee now checking into the trial. Maddow: After a massacre of unarmed American prisoners of war, after the perpetrators were caught and put on trial and convicted, after four separate reviews of the investigation and the trial and the convictions found them all to be legit, found them all to be sound, now the U. S. Senate is doing its own additional investigation, basically because of a foreign influence operation that worked. Reporter: The senators are probing reports that the Germans were beaten and starved to get confessions from them. Remy: The torture stories began to be fed to the United States and picked up by the American press and by other sympathetic and interested Americans, including some members of Congress. Maddow: The Senate hearings began in earnest in April 1949. The Armed Services Committee had appointed three senators to investigate, Raymond Baldwin, Estes Kefauver, and Lester Hunt. They’re from different parties, different parts of the country but they’re united in their determination that they’re going to do this properly. Remy: The three members of the subcommittee, Baldwin in particular, was determined to make this investigation as thorough as it possibly could be. Maddow: That earnest determination from these three senators soon runs right into the equal and opposite force that was Joe McCarthy. McDaniel: For reasons that aren’t clear, Joe McCarthy somehow wiggled himself onto the committee and -- and convinced the leadership to let him come to the committee hearings as a special observer. Maddow: Once the hearings start though, he sheds any pretense that he’s there just to observe. McDaniel: He, in a very belligerent and forceful way, hijacked the hearings and made them very difficult for anybody to -- to find the truth. Maddow: The transcript of the hearings is wild. McCarthy over and over again interrupts the senators who are actually doing the investigation. He speaks more words in the transcript than some of the actual members of the committee. He objects to American G.I.’s, the survivors of the Malmedy Massacre being called to testify. When witnesses do testify, he speaks over them too. Some of them he just berates. Right from the jump, he turns this whole investigation into a spectacle. He basically bullied himself into the hearing room in the first place. Once he was there, he was determined to get his money’s worth. Remy: McCarthy thought this was an easy way to score, an easy and cheap political victory. McDaniel: When you read through the manuscripts, as I did, the picture you get is Hunt, rather reserved, using his time to ask questions that were penetrating and -- and designed to get evidence, but confronted with this brawler Joe McCarthy. Maddow: This strategy, of course, would become a hallmark later in McCarthy’s Senate career, but this is where it starts, the Malmedy Massacre. Joe McCarthy and others, spreading to the American people, pro-Nazi propaganda, straight up lies cooked up in Germany, specifically to undermine and mess with the United States. McDaniel: Almost inexplicably, Joe McCarthy took the side of the Nazis and advocated their position. Maddow: McCarthy announced in the Senate all the Nazis’ horror movie claims as if they were proven facts. They were not. He said the vast majority of the Nazi defendants had been quote, crippled for life by the supposed torture. None of them were. Weirdly, he embellished even that, saying the crippled-for-life Nazis were kids. They were 15 and 16 years old. That wasn’t true either. But by then, he apparently was just riffing, just making stuff up. Anchor: In the Malmedy case, the army denied any brutality to obtain confessions. Maddow: And then he goes even further. He zeroes in on U.S. soldiers who had been involved in the investigation in questioning the Nazi defendants. He zeroes in on very specific U.S. soldiers. Remy: McCarthy learns about the background of some of the interrogators, and he makes a connection that some of the investigators were Jewish. He starts to parrot some of the same antisemitic narratives and he tries very clumsily and ineffectively to introduce this into the dialogue. Maddow: He calls U.S. soldiers who were Jewish, who were investigators on the case quote, a vengeance team. He said they had committed quote, brutalities greater than any we have ever accused Hitler Germany of employing. He said the soldiers who obtained confessions from the Nazis were quote, non-Aryans who quote, intensely hated the German people as a race.  This Senate performance by Joe McCarthy, his takeover of the investigation, his amplification, even his embellishment of these lurid Nazi talking points, it made for a real spectacle. Even more so when he made a big show of storming out of the proceedings. Remy: He quit and storms out of the committee very dramatically and very publicly and accuses the army of a cover up and a whitewash. Maddow: When he stormed out of the hearing, McCarthy went straight to the press. He accused the U.S. Army of terribly mistreating the Nazis. He said the Senate investigation was rigged. He said what the U.S. Army did in the Malmedy trial was quote, a brand of brutalitarianism worse than that practiced by the most morally degenerate in Hitler’s camp. He said the day is going to come when the chair of the Senate investigation, Senator Baldwin, would quote, bitterly regret what McCarthy called his criminal responsibility for a whitewash. This Nazi propaganda, this hoax, was a cause that had been championed by the Chicago Tribune and by trailing ends of the America First movement, by those who had taken up for the pro-Nazi Sedition Trial defendants during the war. And now, here was Joe McCarthy getting his first national attention as a senator for grabbing that same mantle. It got him a big picture in the New York Times. The caption was, an irate senator takes a walk. The senators on the committee, as shocked as they were by McCarthy buffaloing his way through the hearings and storming out theatrically and uncritically shoveling all the claims made by the Nazis, they knew they still had an investigation to complete, with or without him. They brought the investigation all the way to Germany to talk firsthand to the Nazis who were claiming they had been tortured by Americans. They talked to the Nazi lawyer, who had been spreading those claims so effectively, both in Germany and the United States. They interviewed medical personnel and reviewed medical records to look into all those supposedly severe and permanent injuries. Remy: The medical exams simply showed no evidence of the kind of physical damage to bones, to testicles that the prisoners had claimed in their affidavits. Maddow: Senator Lester Hunt himself proved particularly valuable to that part of the investigation, thanks of all things to his background as a dentist.  McDaniel: He reviewed medical records from their period of confinement to determine whether he saw any evidence of torture. And he was specifically assigned that because of his medical background. Maddow: The Senate’s investigation of the Malmedy trial was the most thorough review that was done of the entire affair. The official record of the hearings alone is nearly 2,000 pages. They interviewed more than a hundred witnesses, including every investigator who questioned the Nazi defendants. They spoke to the officials who ran the prison where the defendants had been held. They spoke directly to the Nazi soldiers who claimed they’d been tortured by the Americans. They spoke to doctors who had treated them. They spoke to the assistants of the doctors, at least one of whom bluntly admitted that the affidavit filed in her name had been written up by the Nazi lawyers who had taken over the case without even consulting her. In the end, the findings of the investigation were clear. Remy: The committee concluded that the torture claims were baseless. Maddow: Baseless, like every review that had come before it. No matter what Joe McCarthy and Bill Langer and the Chicago Tribune and all the old America First guys were trying to sell, it just did not happen. Remy: Some of the convicted men themselves later admitted that they had lied or that they had grossly exaggerated what had happened to them. Maddow: As part of their investigation, the senators had asked U.S. Army counterintelligence in Germany to look into the origin of these false claims. Counterintelligence reported back that quote, a number of former ex-Nazis, particularly high ranking ones, are financing and supporting campaigns against the Malmedy case. Remy: Groups of ex-Nazis worked to undermine both the project of denazification, right, purging German society of all traces of national socialism. They also fought very hard to undermine war crimes trials. This was mainly because, not only were they unrepentant Nazis, they considered Germans to be victims. Victims of the Jews. Maddow: The Senate committee wrote in their final report that the torture claims had been ginned up in Germany as part of what they called an organized effort to revive the nationalistic spirit in Germany through every means possible, an effort to revive the nationalistic spirit. The Associated Press put a bit of a finer point on it. Their headline was quote, Senators See Malmedy Case as Dangerous Pro-Nazi Plot. So, the torture claims, they were not just frivolously made up, they were deliberately created for a reason. Not only to free the members of the Nazi SS Blowtorch Battalion but also to try to free all of the Nazis, to try to vindicate the Nazis, and to discredit the allies. And in Germany, to try to return Nazism to power. Why were there Americans who were willing to get on board with this, including this World War II veteran, this ambitious young senator, Joe McCarthy? Remy: Why did he become involved in this? And that’s an interesting question. Maddow: Joe McCarthy’s speeches about Malmedy, his repetition and exaggeration of the false torture claims, his accusations that the investigation in the Senate was a big cover up, these claims by McCarthy not only got him attention in the United States, they were getting picked up and broadcast all over Germany. This U. S. Senator validating, legitimizing the Nazis claims about the terrible allies, the terrible Americans, doing to the innocent Nazis things that were worse than anything Hitler ever did. One Washington columnist wrote, throughout Germany today and particularly in underground SS and reviving Nazi channels, Germans are circulating savagely anti-American propaganda. This propaganda represents Americans as brutal, gangster-like oppressors. Senator Joseph McCarthy gave this propaganda an important assist. That was columnist Marquis Childs. And as he and other members of the press tried to sound the alarm about the consequences of what McCarthy was doing, one senator who knew exactly what McCarthy was up to was deciding what to do about it. McDaniel: I suspect he was a little shell shocked by McCarthy’s tactics. He was not bound by the truth or by facts. He would say anything at any time. That -- that was something that Lester Hunt, both on a personal level and in political experience, had never encountered. Maddow: Lester Hunt was disgusted with what he saw from Joe McCarthy. When McCarthy released his own report on Malmedy, repeating the torture allegations and alleging, again, some sinister cover up in the Senate, Senator Hunt went through it line by line. And he wrote in the margins where McCarthy was wrong, where he was definitely lying, and must have known he was lying. McDaniel: He’d only been in the Senate such a short period of time and didn’t quite know what to make of it or how to -- how to challenge it. It just wasn’t Hunt’s style to engage in that sort of verbal combat. You know that’s not the way they did things back in Wyoming, and he wasn’t accustomed to that. And this was his first time on that stage with people of that kind. Maddow: Lester Hunt did mostly hold his fire while the Senate investigation was ongoing. But when it was over, he decided he did need to take a stand against McCarthy. He accused him publicly of hitting below the belt with his attacks. He said he personally resented McCarthy’s efforts to delegitimize the Senate investigation. He was not shy at all about telling the country what he thought about McCarthy. McDaniel: He called him an opportunist. Said he was a liar and a drunk. He was pretty -- he was pretty blunt about it. Maddow: Lester Hunt standing up to McCarthy in this way — it would end up costing him. Because Hunt and his colleagues on that committee, and members of the press, they soon discovered what exactly McCarthy had been up to with this Malmedy stunt. Who he had been involved with. Joseph McCarthy’s maiden voyage into the national spotlight, this strange defense of the Nazis, it was not a one-off for him. In many ways it was a sign of what was yet to come. David Austin Walsh: He would take information wherever he could find it. And if it meant working with, you know, far-right people with a specific agenda, then he would do that. Maddow: McCarthy was about to open the door to some of the darkest elements on the American ultra right, groups who wanted to end American democracy. Steven Ross: He would start his meetings by heiling Hitler and then heiling McCarthy. Maddow: And a man who at that very moment was on the run from U.S. authorities over his explicit ties to the Nazis. Jackson: Yockey assumes a number of identities, keeps moving, first he’s over here, then he’s over there. Maddow: Francis Yockey, the fugitive American fascist, was about to re-emerge in a way that would leave American authorities in something approaching a panic. Mostrom: If any journalist had learned about this connection, I think Joe McCarthy’s career would have been severely damaged right then and there. But the fact is no one found out. Maddow: That is next time. Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra is a production of MSNBC. This episode was written by myself, Mike Yarvitz, and Kelsey Desiderio.

Netflix’s hit documentary ‘Tell Them You Love Me’ highlights a misleading promise,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 7, 2024, 10:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-new-documentary-tell-them-that-you-love-me-rcna160480,"My first encounter with the method known as “facilitated communication” (FC) dates back to 1990, at the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication Conference held in Stockholm. During that event, I attended a presentation by Rosemary Crossley of Australia, the inventor of FC. She claimed that hidden language, literacy and cognitive skills among individuals who are nonspeaking could be unveiled using a new strategy. And she described the process: using a facilitator supporting the hand or arm of a nonspeaking individual to construct a message by pointing to letters on an alphabet display or keyboard. Given my extensive experience at Boston Children’s Hospital, where I had established the first clinic in the country devoted exclusively to developing and applying a variety of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies for children and adults who used limited or no speech, I was immediately skeptical. But as the talk concluded, I figured, “What harm can it do?” Netflix’s new documentary “Tell Them You Love Me” sadly answers that question. The film, which delves into complex themes of race, disability and communication in the context of sexual exploitation, quickly captivated audiences. For years, FC has sparked debate over its bold but I would argue unproven assertions of unlocking hidden linguistic and cognitive abilities among individuals with significant developmental disabilities. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence against the method, its persistence remains. Numerous established professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association uniformly reject FC, yet it continues to have enthusiastic supporters. Soon after the Stockholm conference, I was recruited by a prosecutor to determine the authorship of messages generated using FC in a case regarding allegations of sexual abuse. I was tasked with developing a method to identify who really generated the messages in question: the individual being facilitated, or the facilitator who was in continuous contact with their body as the messages were typed. I devised and administered a series of procedures in which neither the facilitator nor the person being facilitated were aware of what the other was shown. The findings left no doubt in my mind that the facilitator authored every response, and in turn was responsible for making false allegations of abuse. After publishing the results of this investigation, I was asked to participate in many more cases over the next three decades where teachers and family members were falsely accused of sexual misconduct. In these legal cases, my testing found that it was the facilitator and never the individual being facilitated who authored all messages. Sadly, dozens of similar cases involving FC took place in courtrooms across the country. Netflix’s hit documentary details one of these legal cases. I believe the driving forces behind FC’s continued popularity are multifaceted. On the one hand, there are clinicians and educators who ardently promote FC even though it lacks empirical support. Their unwavering belief in its efficacy likely stems from a genuine desire to help individuals with disabilities communicate, but does not reflect evidence-based practices. As Janyce Boynton, a former facilitator, asserts in her article “Facilitated Communication — What Harm It Can Do: Confessions of a Former Facilitator,” a well-meaning facilitator can be completely unaware that they are authoring facilitated encounters. In 1995, I was part of a research team that proved that facilitators could be easily created. Initially, study participants were informed that a promising new communication method that required they “facilitate” was being explored. After viewing a short training video on how to facilitate and watching the initial positive footage taken from the PBS “Frontline” documentary “Prisoners of Silence,” they met and went on to facilitate answers to a series of questions that only they — and not the actor pretending to be nonspeaking — knew. This experiment suggests that what was at play was the ideomotor effect, a psychological phenomenon often used to explain the mystery behind the Ouija board. On the other hand, families often cling to FC because it offers a semblance of normalcy. The illusion that their children can express themselves independently becomes a powerful motivator. The litany of sophisticated messages often created using FC likely feel compelling because they align with the value our society places on cognitive and behavioral norms rather than accepting individuals with disabilities and providing them with appropriate accommodations. In essence, this is an understandable clash between evidence, deeply held convictions, societal norms and hope. At the end of “Tell Them You Love Me,” the mother of a man diagnosed with cerebral palsy states: “Just embrace him. Just love him for who he is.” As a clinician aware of the plethora of existing augmentative and alternative communication methods, the acceptance of an individual and their disability is a vital part of identifying appropriate accommodations for authentic communication. For decades, I have asked what I consider to be an obvious and essential question: Why aren’t individuals who use FC routinely given the opportunity to use existing and well-established assistive technology strategies that would increase their independence and eliminate the relentless question of authorship? These independent means of creating messages include a wide range of proven clinical options such as specialized keyboards, software programs that only require a single, controlled movement like a head nod or eye blink to spell words, or advanced technologies such as eye-typing, which allows spelling by just looking at letters on a screen. In hindsight, “What harm can FC do?” feels premature and grossly inaccurate."
I’m a doctor. Biden’s debate performance led me to a very different takeaway.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-debate-nominee-ageism-aging-rcna160319,"Following President Joe Biden’s troubling performance at the presidential debate with Donald Trump, Democrats have been consumed by a frenzied dispute around which candidate should replace Biden on the November 2024 ballot. But I came away from the debate with a different takeaway: How does the United States treat its aging population? Despite advancements in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, ageism remains one of the last socially acceptable prejudices, not so subtly ingrained in our culture, media and institutions. Age is inescapable. It comes for all of us, if we’re lucky. For those who are not experiencing symptoms of advanced aging themselves, they’re almost surely impacted by an acquaintance or family member who is. Yet as a society we portray aging as something to be feared and avoided, reinforcing negative perceptions that contribute to the marginalization of older adults — including our elected leaders. At the same time, society is pushing to increase longevity and life expectancy, evidenced by an entire industry based on the fallacy that we can stave off age with the right product, practice or diet. Our treatment of older Americans reflects a dismal reality: We are not prepared for our aging population; the number of people 85 and older is expected to nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040. By 2034, older adults will outnumber children under the age of 18 in the United States for the first time in history. With this aging come some important societal dilemmas. Older adults have more chronic health needs, are more isolated and are also more likely to work and experience workplace discrimination due to their age. And as we age, we are also leaning on family members for assistance: 1 in 4 family members serve as a caregiver, often unpaid. One in 6 older Americans face hiring discrimination when looking for a job and 2 in 3 face discrimination once hired. Biden’s symptoms on display during the debate were a medical textbook of common findings for a geriatric population — delayed response time, difficulty finding words and so on. Combine that with little sleep and a viral illness or a cold, anyone over the age of 40 would likely suffer similar symptoms like hoarse voice, slowed reaction time and confusion. This is not a defense for the debate performance, but simply a reminder that both presidential candidates are, simply put, old. With such age there is an expected degree of possible setbacks; a bad cold, a hip fracture that could turn fatal, a cardiac event that lands you in the hospital. It is completely misguided to also deny our society’s appetite for engaging in both ageism and our own amnesia regarding the effects of age. Historically, the age of U.S. presidents has been a subject of debate and scrutiny, with concerns often raised about their physical and mental capacity to handle the rigorous demands of the presidency. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 at the age of 69, he became the oldest president to be inaugurated at that time. During his second term, which began when he was 73, questions about his age and cognitive abilities intensified. Despite these concerns, Reagan completed his term and left office at 77, setting a record as the oldest president at the end of his tenure. Since Reagan’s time, the life expectancy for all adults, including white males, has increased several years due to advancements in medical technology, such as innovations in cancer treatment and cardiac drugs, even with Covid-19 causing a setback in life expectancy. In short, we are living longer and longer thanks to science. Having two of the oldest people to date running for presidential office is a sign of success and progress, even with the setbacks it presents. Which brings us back to the age paradox: Our desire to live longer is difficult to reconcile with society’s treatment of people who manage to do it. Polling data indicates that a majority of voters have reservations about the ability of older candidates to effectively manage the responsibilities of the presidency. For instance, a Pew Research Center survey found that only 3% of Americans believe the best age for a president is in their 70s or older, with the majority preferring candidates in their 50s. The concerns are not unfounded, as cognitive decline can affect decision-making, memory and the ability to handle stress — all critical aspects of presidential responsibility. But it is also true that age brings experience and wisdom, undoubtedly valuable assets in a president. While debates will always have some element of disagreement, and the recent one is no exception, a conversation about aging need not be yet another thing that divides us. Instead, it is a chance to reflect deeply and show great compassion for our elderly, while also acknowledging that we are intelligent enough to discern between showmanship and substance. Therein lies true common ground."
How a second Trump term could put military officers in a dangerous bind,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-trump-military-rcna160172,"In her dissent from Monday’s Supreme Court ruling that a president enjoys immunity for “official acts,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the 6-3 ruling makes possible the hypothetical scenario of a U.S. president evading prosecution after ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent or even organizing a military coup. Sotomayor, who concluded her opinion by writing, “With fear for our democracy, I dissent,” isn’t wrong to feel that way. It’s questionable at best whether the guardrails of our military officers’ oaths to support and defend the Constitution would be able to sustain our democracy in the face of a relentless assault sure to come in a second Trump administration. The relationship between our civilian and military leaders is foundational for our democracy and rests on an implicit “contract” requiring mutual respect, trust and consultation. The military is allowed autonomy over decisions within its professional jurisdiction and expects to be consulted on matters of national security. The military’s professional responsibility is to provide unbridled advice to civilian leadership and accept that final decisions rest with those elected by the American people. In return, the military expects to remain apolitical and not be used as a partisan tool. Ours is one of the few nations whose military swears allegiance to a system of government and not a dictator, king, queen or president. However, during Trump’s term as president, he sought the support of the military even as he was sometimes contemptuous of its prerogatives. At times, he seemed to view the military as just another political force to be used for partisan advantage, and he frequently referred to senior officers as “my generals.” Because Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution says that “the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States,” some Americans fear that military officers will follow any order from a president reflexively and without question. That’s not necessarily true, but Monday’s immunity ruling may encourage a president to pursue absolute obedience from our nation’s military. And that’s dangerous. What’s known as the commander in chief clause caused significant debate during the Constitutional Convention, and our Founding Fathers were determined to ensure military and political leaders worked together and that no one leader would be able to order the use of military might unilaterally or illegally. Even so, they didn’t precisely define the extent of those powers in the Constitution. Thus, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling exposes not only the clause’s ambiguity but also a potential dilemma facing military officers who swear to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” As a faculty member at West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy and a dean of the U.S. Army War College, I frequently witnessed cadets, midshipmen and serving officers discussing the legal and moral obligations of their oath. They’re taught that following a clearly illegal order would make them morally and legally responsible for their actions. It wouldn’t matter if it’s Lt. William L. Calley ordering his men to shoot Vietnamese civilians or, to the SEAL Team Six hypothetical, a president ordering a political opponent’s assassination. (As an aside, let me say that I know and have known a significant number of SEALs. They are some of the most professional officers in the military. They find this scenario insulting.) Tragically, the Supreme Court decision may have made it likely that military personnel will wrestle with the dilemma of either openly defying the commander in chief or subverting  their sense of both duty and personal morality — at least if there’s a second Trump administration. The military leadership’s collective discomfort was demonstrated multiple times when Trump was president. He belittled senior military officers and took over Independence Day, ordering service members to participate in a celebration that was as much about himself as it was about America. A military officer serving on the National Security Council cited his oath as an officer to explain his resignation following his testimony during the first Trump impeachment. Trump interfered with the military justice system by pardoning three service members convicted of war crimes and suggested to his chief of staff that generals should follow his orders like German generals did for Hitler. Ultimately, his actions resulted in the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issuing a memorandum to all top military commanders reaffirming the critical importance of the oath taken by every member of the armed forces. Gen. Mark Milley wrote in the margin, “We all committed our lives to the idea that is America. We will stay true to that and the American people.” Some in the military — as well as retired officers serving in senior administration positions — exercised “respectful disobedience” in order to appear supportive of the president while keeping his worst excesses at bay. Disturbingly, Trump has revealed how he might abuse civil-military relations during a second term. He has said he’d use the military to carry out mass deportations of people here illegally, contrary to “Posse Comitatus” law, which forbids the military from conducting operations on American territory. He’s also said he’d make extensive use of the Insurrection Act and order federal troops to American cities as he sees fit. The former president has even written on social media that he would order a televised military tribunal for former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, who co-chaired the U.S. House Jan. 6 committee. Such actions could result in mass resignations by senior military officers. But Trump could also seek to avoid opposition to any questionable orders by placing loyalists such as retired Gen. Michael Flynn in key positions or by appointing only senior military officers who have passed some form of political loyalty test. A second Trump term could bring “the end of our democracy,” says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, “and the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order.” That’s not hyperbole. Trump showed an increasing willingness to force senior military officers to choose between these potentially conflicting loyalties, and he would likely do so with even greater intensity if he becomes commander in chief again."
Conspiracy theorist RFK Jr. has some thoughts on how to address 9/11 conspiracy theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 1:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-9-11-conspiracy-ufos-rcna160550,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., independent presidential candidate and proponent of various conspiracy theories, said he will “open the files” on the 9/11 attacks if elected president, vowing not to “take sides” on the issue. “My take on 9/11: It’s hard to tell what is a conspiracy theory and what isn’t. But conspiracy theories flourish when the government routinely lies to the public,” Kennedy wrote in a post on X on Friday. “As President I won’t take sides on 9/11 or any of the other debates. But I can promise is that I will open the files and usher in a new era of transparency.” The long-shot presidential candidate said his stance on 9/11 came in response to recent reporting from CBS News’ “60 Minutes” that a Saudi intelligence operative with ties to two 9/11 hijackers may have been involved in planning the attacks. Kennedy said that releasing government files on “contentious topics” like 9/11 and unidentified aerial phenomena, or UFOs — issues he said he was “personally agnostic on” — would be his way of re-establishing public trust in the government. “Speculation about what our government may be covering up is rife outside the mainstream of our political culture,” he wrote. “Trust [in] government is at an all-time low. The way to restore that trust is through honesty and transparency.” Kennedy’s reputation as a conspiracy theorist precedes him. He has repeatedly spread debunked anti-vaccine claims, suggested that gender dysphoria is a result of chemicals in the water supply, questioned whether HIV infections cause AIDS, and promoted the conspiracy theory that the CIA assassinated his uncle President John F. Kennedy. His comments about the 9/11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people, also came on the heels of recent disturbing news reports about his past. In May, The New York Times reported that Kennedy said in 2012 that a worm had eaten part of his brain. This week, Vanity Fair reported on a sexual assault accusation against Kennedy and suggested that he may have eaten dog meat in the past. He declined to comment on the sexual assault allegation and said the cooked animal he was pictured with was a goat."
Trump uses Supreme Court immunity ruling in classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 11:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-immunity-classified-documents-florida-rcna160537,"Donald Trump’s lawyers invoked the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in a filing on Friday afternoon in his federal classified documents case, asking U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to pause the proceedings so they can lay the groundwork to have the case dismissed. The filing goes on to claim that President Joe Biden’s rebuke of the Supreme Court for instituting virtually no limits on a president’s power was proof that Biden had coordinated with the Justice Department to target Trump. The claim that the criminal justice system has been weaponized against Trump is a long-running accusation that Republicans have leveled against Democrats, even as Trump himself has vowed to use the power of his office to punish his enemies if re-elected. (Read more from my colleague Ja’han Jones on the right’s deployment of the “lawfare” claim against Democrats.) Cannon agreed on Saturday to push back some deadlines in the case, giving special counsel Jack Smith until July 18 to respond to the request for further delay. The high court ruled on Monday that Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for some official acts in his federal election interference case, but the decision also threatens the prosecution of Trump’s other ongoing criminal cases, as well as his conviction in the New York hush money case. The sentencing hearing for the latter, initially scheduled for July 11, was pushed back to September following the immunity ruling, as his attorneys seek to toss out the conviction entirely. Trump’s classified documents case was already bogged down by a host of issues, in large part because of Cannon’s decisions (or the lack thereof), which have baffled legal experts. She has refused to set a trial date, opting instead to hold long evidentiary hearings on motions, and has moved the case along with little sense of urgency. The defense also presented a presidential immunity argument in the case back in February. A trial in the classified documents case — already unlikely to happen before November — now seems an even more remote possibility altogether."
Tucker Carlson gets embarrassing rebuke from Ukraine,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 8:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/volodymyr-zelenskyy-tucker-carlson-interview-rcna160471,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office on Thursday denied social media pundit Tucker Carlson’s claim that he had landed an interview with the nation’s leader. In a statement in Ukrainian on Facebook, Zelenskyy’s spokesperson Sergii Nykyforov took a swipe at the far-right commentator, telling him to check his sources in Russia’s FSB security service “more carefully.” “The President of Ukraine has a completely different schedule, and Tucker Carlson is not there,” Nykyforov said, according to an English translation of the statement. Carlson had teased an interview with Zelenskyy the day before, writing on X, “Looks like we’ve got the Zelenskyy interview. We’ve been trying for two years, and with particular intensity after interviewing Putin in February.” Carlson, who has been attacked for his pro-Kremlin stance, interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin in February. It was Putin’s first interview with a Western media figure since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Carlson was widely criticized for his softball questions and his apparent deference to the Russian leader. A former Fox News cable show host, Carlson has tried to reassert himself as a power player in the media landscape since being booted from Fox in April 2023. Months afterward, he launched the Tucker Carlson Network, a subscription streaming service, where he has continued to peddle conspiracy theories and misinformation to his audience. Segments of his show have also aired on Russian state TV. (Carlson has denied any involvement, telling CNN, “Of course I have no partnership with Russia.”) Carlson’s process for verifying sources has raised questions in the past. In March of this year, two YouTube pranksters claimed they tricked Carlson into believing that he was interviewing a Kensington Palace employee who had been fired for poorly editing a photo of Catherine, Princess of Wales."
'As long as I gave it my all': Biden reflects on potentially losing to Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 8:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-abc-interview-gave-it-my-all-rcna160528,"President Joe Biden’s make-or-break interview with ABC News on Friday night did little to convince alarmed Democrats that he is capable of winning the election and serving another four years in the White House. But among the more jarring moments in the interview was when Biden framed his insistence on running in this critically important election — and his potential defeat — as a personal endeavor. “And if you stay in and Trump is elected, and everything you’re warning about comes to pass, how will you feel in January?” asked ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. “I’ll feel, as long as I gave it my all and I did [as] good a job as I know I can do, that’s what this is about,” Biden said. To hear Biden say the election is about putting his best foot forward is striking, given the stakes as Democrats themselves have described them. And the growing public discontent within his own party suggests that not all Democrats believe they are giving this election their all with Biden as the nominee. Biden also demonstrated an unwillingness to address real concerns about his fitness for office, dismissing his flagging poll numbers and a belief among some Democrats and donors that he cannot beat Trump. Instead of reassuring Democrats, the interview may accelerate the revolt against his nomination. After it aired, two more House Democrats, Reps. Mike Quigley and Angie Craig, joined the calls for Biden to step aside. An anonymous House Democrat told NBC News: “It made me sad. Completely out of touch with reality and insulated from truth. I’ll be breaking my silence soon.”"
