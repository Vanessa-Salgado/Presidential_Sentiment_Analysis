Steve Bannon steps closer to Supreme Court in seeking full circuit review,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/steve-bannon-contempt-supreme-court-rcna162120,"The Supreme Court last month rejected Steve Bannon’s bid to stay free while he appeals his contempt of Congress conviction. But lawyers for the former Trump White House adviser are still pressing the appeal while Bannon serves his four-month sentence, bringing the merits of his legal challenge a step closer to the justices. On Monday, Bannon’s lawyers asked the full federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., to rehear his challenge that a three-judge panel of that court rejected in May. Bannon was convicted in 2022 after failing to comply with a House. Jan. 6 committee subpoena under a federal law that criminalizes “willfully” failing to respond to a congressional subpoena. On appeal, Bannon argued that a conviction under that law requires proving bad faith and that his counsel advised him not to respond. But the federal appeals court panel cited D.C. Circuit precedent from 1961, Licavoli v. United States, to say that “willfully” only requires that the defendant deliberately and intentionally refused to comply with a congressional subpoena and that an advice of counsel defense doesn’t apply. The circuit panel also cited that precedent in rejecting Bannon’s motion to stay free while he appealed. Notably, one of the panel judges, Trump appointee Justin Walker, dissented from the release denial, saying that, while the circuit panel was bound by its precedent, the Supreme Court might take a different view. The Supreme Court then denied Bannon’s release bid last month and he reported to prison on July 1, but his underlying appeal is still pending. In his rehearing petition to the full circuit Monday, Bannon’s lawyers said the appeals court “should grant rehearing and eliminate Licavoli’s anomalous mens rea holding” — mens rea being the legal term for criminal intent. Even if the full circuit rejects Bannon, that could just be the next step on the appeal’s way to the justices. Yet, even if the high court ultimately agrees with Bannon, that wouldn’t likely happen before Bannon is released from prison, though he likely would still want his conviction reversed after he’s released. If the justices wanted to help the Trump ally, they could have granted his motion to stay free while he appealed. Nonetheless, they can still choose to get involved in the merits of the appeal even though they rejected his release bid. If the justices ultimately weigh in on the merits of the issue, the court’s ruling would affect not just Bannon but other congressional contempt cases, too. Another former Trump White House adviser, Peter Navarro, also has a pending contempt of Congress appeal in the D.C. Circuit. The justices similarly rejected his release-pending-appeal bid and he is due to be released from prison on Wednesday, after which he’s reportedly expected to speak at the Republican National Convention this week in Milwaukee. As with so much else, Bannon’s appeal is playing out against the backdrop of November’s presidential election. According to the federal Bureau of Prisons, he’s incarcerated in Danbury, Connecticut, and will be released on Oct. 29. At the end of his previous presidential term, Trump pardoned Bannon for separate federal crimes in the alleged “We Build the Wall” scheme, for which Bannon faces related New York state charges that presidents can’t pardon. Trump can’t be elected in time to spring Bannon from prison in his latest federal criminal case, but just as Trump is poised to get rid of his own federal cases if he returns to the White House, he could upend Bannon’s by pardoning him again.

"Tuesday’s Mini-Report, 7.16.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tuesdays-mini-report-71624-rcna162214,"Today’s edition of quick hits. * The latest in the investigation: “Before a would-be assassin took aim at Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, local police officers notified the former president’s Secret Service detail that they were looking for a suspicious person in the area, a U.S. official told NBC News. The suspicious person, later identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was first flagged to local police officers by rallygoers on their way into the event. The attendees reported they saw Crooks pacing and behaving strangely near the magnetometers, four officials told NBC News.” * Expect a robust congressional investigation: “Members of Congress from both parties announced plans Monday to investigate how a shooter was able to get within striking distance of former President Donald Trump, demanding answers from the authorities responsible for protecting the Republican nominee for president.” * In Illinois: “Two failures of the Nashville Reservoir dam in Illinois amidst intense flooding Tuesday have led officials to urge residents in nearly 300 homes to evacuate.” * At the border: “Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico plunged 29% in June, the lowest month of Joe Biden’s presidency, according to figures released Monday that provide another window on the impact of a new rule to temporarily suspend asylum.” * Housing policy: “President Biden will unveil a new proposal in Nevada on Tuesday to cap rental costs nationwide, according to three people familiar with the matter. ... Biden’s plan — which would need to be approved by Congress — calls for stripping a tax benefit from landlords who increase their tenants’ rent more than 5 percent per year, the people said. The measure would only apply to landlords who own more than 50 units, which represents roughly half of all rental properties, the people said.” * Apparently, some folks have a real problem with trans people: “SpaceX CEO and X owner Elon Musk said Tuesday he will move the headquarters of both companies from California to Texas. Musk vowed the moves in response to Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) signing a new law on Tuesday that bars school districts in California from requiring parents to be notified of a child’s gender identification change.” * The effects of the Supreme Court’s poor judgment: “Federal prosecutors have begun moving to drop charges accusing Jan. 6 defendants of obstructing Congress’s confirmation of the 2020 presidential election results, offering new plea deals after the Supreme Court last month restricted the government’s use of that count, according to court filings. Some beneficiaries include members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys who are not accused of other felony offenses, but whose leaders were convicted of conspiring to use force to oppose the peaceful transfer of presidential power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.” See you tomorrow."
Marjorie Taylor Greene's RNC speech kicked off an extremist-friendly convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 1:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/marjorie-taylor-greene-rnc-speech-trump-rcna162176,"A lawmaker who mocked a school shooting victim, appeared to endorse political executions, and insisted she would have ""won"" if she had planned the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A lieutenant governor who claimed “some folks need killing” in an unhinged church rant.  An activist who said she’d like to ""lynch"" an election worker.  A podcaster who has platformed white nationalists and has criticized the Civil Rights Act.  Day 1 of the Republican National Convention on Monday put MAGA extremists in the spotlight. Anyone who believed conservative claims about this being an event focused on “unity” after the recent Trump rally shooting have been duped. Having Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene kick things off was a clear signal that this wasn’t going to be a kumbaya moment. And true to form, the Georgia Republican delivered a speech filled with falsities and far-right rhetoric, including anti-trans bigotry and anti-immigrant xenophobia falsely claiming immigrants have taken American-born workers' jobs.   Greene was followed by North Carolina Lt. Gov. and gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson, who’s well known for his racist, misogynistic and anti-LGBTQ diatribes and who recently earned even more backlash after being recorded telling North Carolina churchgoers that “some folks need killing” during a Christian nationalist rant. Robinson, who’s established a reputation for extremist rhetoric, delivered a speech at the RNC on Monday that focused mostly on the economy and fawning over Trump. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk tried a similar tactic. Kirk, whose organization has helped link far-right extremists to the Republican National Committee and Trump campaign, was a speaker as well. He's presented himself as the GOP’s youth whisperer and used his speech to sell young people on the idea that Trump would be better for their wallets than the Biden administration. Kirk claimed “Democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations” before falsely claiming young people were “richer than ever before” under Trump and that, as president, Trump “will do it again.”  Though they didn't make the speakers list, far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and election-denying pillow-pusher Mike Lindell were given a prominent spot at the convention to host Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast. (Bannon has to miss the RNC this year because he's in prison.) And one of the lesser-known extremists given a platform was Arizona delegate Shelby Busch, who cast her state's delegate votes for Trump on Monday night at the convention. Busch was the subject of a recent ReidOut Blog after she was recorded saying she’d lynch Maricopa County’s Republican recorder, Stephen Richer, if he were in the same room with her. Needless to say, this RNC isn’t shaping up to be the unifying event Republicans have tried to convince voters and the media it would be. Predictably, it’s just a hotbed of MAGA extremism. "
"In the GOP veepstakes, Trump again sidelines men of color",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-vice-president-republican-convention-2024-rcna159159,"It's ""always the bridesmaid, never the bride"" for some aspiring Republican lawmakers. Former President Donald Trump on Monday selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, forming one of the most extreme — and as my colleague Steve Benen noted, most inexperienced — tickets in modern American history. But let's consider some of the people Trump didn’t pick, in particular the Black and the Latino men who happily mortgaged their dignity and laundered Trump’s racism to remain in consideration as potential VP picks, only to be passed over in favor of a rich, white Yale Law School graduate with significantly less political experience than they have. I’m talking about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, who’ve been reduced effectively to token minorities through the process of Trump’s running mate selection.  Rubio, of course, had an acrimonious relationship with Trump during the GOP presidential primary in 2016 — one that got so petty that he resorted to mocking Trump’s, uh, hand size. Arguably, that was the moment that Rubio's political career peaked. “Little Marco,” as Trump once called him, has since joined the ranks of the former president’s unwavering supporters, recently defending Trump’s comments about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the United States as “nothing to do with race” during a Spanish-language interview.   Despite being passed over Monday, Rubio wasted no time in declaring his loyalty to the MAGA cause. Scott and Donalds didn’t fare any better. Donalds, who some pundits had suggested could have appealed to Black voters, was willing to distort history for the former president with his claim at a pro-Trump event that Black families were more ""together"" during the Jim Crow era than in the years that followed. (He later told MSNBC's Joy Reid that “I never said that it was better for Black people in Jim Crow.”) His ahistorical nonsense wasn't enough to earn a spot on the ticket, but Donalds nonetheless threw his support behind Trump-Vance on the opening night of the RNC.  Scott, for his part, was criticized for the moment when he embraced Trump in the middle of a speech to tell him how much he loved him. And you can read here about the misguided podcast that Scott launched with other Black Republicans earlier this year in an attempt to sway Black voters in Trump’s favor (despite not mentioning Trump in the first five episodes).  Like Rubio and Donalds, Scott got little to nothing in return for that effort but still stuck to the party's script, assuring the mostly white crowd of Republican convention attendees that “America is not a racist country.” One wonders if the three lawmakers have learned their roles in Trump’s Republican Party. Perhaps they can hang their hopes on cabinet positions in a possible future Trump administration. But for the time being, it seems clear Trump doesn’t want them as the face of his movement."
I served with Republicans for decades. Trump and JD Vance’s GOP is unrecognizable.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 1:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vance-rnc-republicans-maga-rcna162165,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC's special coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention on July 15. Donald Trump’s choice to tap Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate signals the ex-president isn’t trying to soften any edges ahead of November’s election.  When news of Vance’s place on the Republican ticket was announced Tuesday, I would wager that the only person more excited than the Ohio senator himself was Russian President Vladimir Putin. I’m sure they dropped balloons from the sky wherever Putin was. Vance has strongly opposed sending more aid to Ukraine and even said it was in America’s best interest for the country to cede some of its territory to the Russians. Trump and Vance’s approach to foreign policy has made the Republican Party I knew during my time in the Senate almost unrecognizable. The Republicans I knew were all about making sure America was a beacon to democracies around the world. They would never want us to stand by and do nothing while a desperate thug rolls into another country and tries to change its borders by force.  But it’s not just Vance’s foreign policy positions that should worry Americans; his views on domestic issues are just as terrifying. There’s now a candidate for vice president of the United States who told women to stay in violent marriages and suggested that an abusive household is somehow better for children than divorce. That’s not just bad advice but also bad politics. That kind of messaging won’t help Republicans get more votes in the suburbs of Philadelphia, or the suburbs of Milwaukee.  Instead of trying to soften the edges of the already extreme MAGA agenda, Trump picked someone who sharpens it – a flame thrower, a bombastic guy who will go out there and say whatever the ex-president would like him to. Trump picked Vance because, unlike his former vice president, Mike Pence, the Ohio senator has said he’d happily violate the Constitution to put Trump in power.  Vance says all the things Trump wants him to say, and says them with passion. The former president believes Vance will be loyal to him no matter what. Trump will never have a Pence problem with Vance and that’s why he got picked … even if Trump doesn’t like his facial hair."

Widow of man killed at Trump rally in Pennsylvania says she declined to speak with Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/corey-comperatore-widow-biden-call-trump-shooting-rcna162127,"Helen Comperatore, whose husband was killed Saturday when a gunman tried to assassinate Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, said she declined to speak to President Joe Biden when he called her family afterward. “I didn’t want to talk to him,” she told the New York Post on Monday. “My husband was a devout Republican and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.” She said her husband, Corey Comperatore, was a Trump supporter who was excited to be at the rally with her and their two daughters. “I support Trump. That’s who I’m voting for, but I don’t have ill will towards Biden,” she said. “He didn’t do anything bad to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did.” NBC News reported Tuesday that Trump has reached out and spoken with a member of the Comperatore family. Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief, was 50. Two other men, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were critically injured in the assassination attempt but are now in stable condition. On Sunday, Trump wrote in part on Truth Social: “Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” Helen Comperatore told the New York Post that her husband died while shielding his family and that his last words were “Get down!” Corey Comperatore died “protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired,” Biden said at a White House news conference Sunday. “And he lost his life. God love him.” On Tuesday, House lawmakers introduced a bipartisan resolution to honor Corey Comperatore and denounce political violence."
Why the leaked phone call between Trump and RFK Jr. matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 12:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/leaked-phone-call-trump-rfk-jr-matters-rcna162181,"When reports emerged that Donald Trump had spoken to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., it was only natural to wonder what the two conspiracy theorists had to say to one another. As it turns out, the public received an unexpected peek behind the curtain. NBC News reported: The candidate’s son took down the clip he posted to social media, but not before it was captured and republished. Part of what makes the video notable was the apparent suggestion that Trump and Kennedy are, or at least should be, on the same page politically. “I would love you to do something,” the Republican could be heard saying. “And I think it’ll be so good for you and so big for you. And we’re going to win.” Kennedy apparently agreed, replying, “Yeah.” This did not sound like a conversation between two rival candidates, competing for the same office. Rather, it came across as a nice, cooperative chat — which probably won’t help the chatter about Kennedy deliberately playing the role of spoiler candidate. Also notable was Trump’s anti-vaccine rhetoric. “When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby,” the Republican said. “And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times. And then you hear that it doesn’t have an impact, right? But you and I talked about that a long time ago.” In apparent reference to vaccines, Trump went on tell Kennedy, whose known for his anti-vaccine rhetoric, “I agree with you man, something’s wrong with that whole system.” The best-case scenario is that Trump knew what he was saying was nonsense, but he made the comments anyway in the hopes of currying favor with someone whose endorsement he was seeking. From a public-health perspective, the worst-case scenario is that Trump actually believes what he said — echoing similar earlier comments — and his prospective second-term administration would govern with such beliefs in mind. Postscript: The fact that Kennedy had Trump on speaker has led to speculation that the independent candidate wanted their conversation to be recorded. That's possible, though it's also worth noting that Kennedy has said he's afraid to keep cellphones by his head."

Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was found guilty on all 16 counts on Tuesday in his criminal corruption trial of bribery, acting as a foreign agent and other charges. The jury deliberated for 12.5 hours over three days. Menendez is due to be sentenced Oct. 29 and has vowed to appeal. Federal prosecutors alleged the senator took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for using his political influence to enrich businessmen and benefit Egypt and Qatar. Prosecutors said the bribes included cash and gold, among other things. Following the verdict, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top Democrats called on Menendez to resign. Menendez was tried alongside two businessmen charged in the alleged scheme, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who were found guilty on Tuesday as well. Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged but wasn't part of this trial; she was diagnosed with cancer and her trial is indefinitely delayed. A previous, unrelated bribery trial against the senator in 2017 ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict.

Why the Menendez guilty verdict matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bob-menendez-guilty-verdict-doj-trump-rcna162148,"So much for the claim that the Justice Department is using criminal prosecution as a political weapon. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in New Jersey obtained a conviction against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez on 16 counts including bribery, fraud, extortion and obstruction of justice. The vigorous prosecution of a Democrat in a closely divided U.S. Senate demonstrated clearly that DOJ does not use political affiliation as a factor in making charging decisions. In addition to the Menendez case, federal prosecutors recently filed criminal charges against another Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar, of Texas. Cuellar and his wife were charged in May with bribery and money laundering for an alleged scheme to accept $600,000 from an Azerbaijani oil and gas company and a Mexican bank in exchange for using his office to influence policy in their favor. (Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing.) These cases should help refute the baseless claims by former President Donald Trump and his allies that the Department of Justice under the Biden administration is using prosecution as a political tool. After his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan, Trump posted on social media that it was “naïve” to believe that “Crooked Joe Biden was not involved in my Show Trial. HOW STUPID! Not only is he involved, he is virtually leading it, and all of the other Trials as well.” Trump advised the public to “take a look at the DOJ/White House Thugs involved, and everything else. Biden is incompetent, and feels that Weaponization is the only way he can win.” But it’s important to remember that those claims have no basis in fact. Special counsel Jack Smith was appointed in both of Trump’s federal cases precisely to provide a measure of independence from the president. (Trump was separately charged with interfering in the 2020 presidential election and unlawfully retaining national defense information. On Monday, the classified documents case was dismissed by Judge Aileen Cannon, but Smith has vowed to appeal.) And state prosecutors, like New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, are members of separate sovereigns, beholden in no way to a U.S. president. And yet, during a recent interview, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was on the vice presidential short list, echoed this same false narrative. “I’m uncomfortable with the fact now that we have a president who targets political opponents. That’s what’s happened under Joe Biden,” Rubio said. “You look at what their efforts and what they’ve done in the courts to persecute and prosecute Donald Trump,” he said. “They tried to bankrupt him. They’ve tried to silence him. They’ve tried to jail him. They’ve gone after his allies every single day. Some of these are ridiculous charges.” One of the great casualties of the Trump era has been public confidence in law enforcement. Accusations that DOJ has been “weaponized” to go after public officials based on political motives undermines the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. And false claims that are repeated, no matter how ludicrous, can gain traction among some members of the public.    As a former federal prosecutor, I know that DOJ attorneys are nonpartisan professionals who scrupulously avoid politics. DOJ’s policies are contained in an online handbook known as the Justice Manual. Among its foundational policies are the “Principles of Federal Prosecution,“ which state: “In determining whether to commence or recommend prosecution or take other action against a person, the attorney for the government may not be influenced by the person’s... political association, activities, or beliefs.” These rules are enforced by supervisors, the Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility and the disciplinary authorities of the states where prosecutors are licensed as members of the bar. Prosecutors who violate these rules are subject to suspension, termination or disbarment. Further checks on prosecutorial abuse exist in the form of grand juries and trial juries, trial judges and appellate judges. Attacking the credibility of democratic institutions is a tactic authoritarians have used throughout history. If people lack confidence in the press, in the civil service, in career prosecutors, or in the courts, then efforts to hold corrupt officials accountable is weakened. Republicans have worked to undermine all of these groups. But for now, the Menendez case provides just one more concrete example of DOJ prosecuting cases appropriately — that is, meting out justice based on facts, not political agendas."
The Democratic debate over Biden’s electoral future comes roaring back,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democratic-debate-bidens-electoral-future-comes-roaring-back-rcna162136,"As of late last week, the debate in Democratic circles about President Joe Biden’s electoral future remained robust. The list of party officials calling on the incumbent to forgo his re-election plans continued to grow, and uncertainty reigned. And then a gunman tried to assassinate Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, at which point the Democratic conversation came to a sudden halt. It’s not that any of the relevant players had changed their mind, it was simply a situation in which officials were so horrified by the shooting that they informally agreed to temporarily put the discussion aside. The conversation appears to have made a comeback. The New York Times reported: According to the Times’ report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, Schiff — an influential voice in Democratic politics — told supporters privately, “I think if [Biden] is our nominee, I think we lose. And we may very, very well lose the Senate and lose our chance to take back the House.” The California Democrat, it’s worth emphasizing for context, is not among the congressional Democrats who’ve publicly called on the president to stand down. There are a variety of other related data points circulating in Democratic circles on Tuesday morning: * Biden sat down with NBC News’ Lester Holt and hit some rough spots. * Separate polls from the Times and Virginia Commonwealth University found Virginia becoming an increasingly competitive 2024 battleground. This is a state Biden won by nearly double digits four years ago, and which Republicans didn’t even try to pursue, but which now appears to be a potential battleground. * This follows a related Times report from late last week that said, “Down-ballot Democrats, local elected officials and party strategists say Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Virginia — all of which Mr. Biden won comfortably in 2020 — could be in play in November after his miserable debate performance last month.” * In hypothetical general election match-ups against Donald Trump, the latest Times polling found Vice President Kamala Harris faring a little better than Biden in Pennsylvania and Virginia. * The latest round of polling from YouGov found Trump leading Biden in literally every swing state, despite the same surveys showing Democratic Senate candidates faring well. It led Matt Yglesias, among others, to argue, “I think a non-Biden candidate would have a good chance of converging toward the polling strength of Senate Democrats, while Biden risks pulling senators down to his level.” * The YouGov polling also found that 70% of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — the three battleground states Team Biden has emphasized most — believe the incumbent is too old to be president. It might be tempting to think Democrats still have a month to figure out what to do: The Democratic National Convention kicks off on August 19, which is five weeks away. But that’s not quite right: Democratic officials are actually moving forward with plans to formally nominate Biden by way of a virtual process by the end of this month — as in, over the next two weeks. This approach was set in motion by Republican lawmakers in Ohio playing an annoying ballot-access game, and while state policymakers ultimately reversed course, making the Democratic virtual gathering unnecessary, the DNC appears ready to implement the plan anyway. All of which is to say, Democrats hoping to see a change at the top of their ticket will need to speak now or forever hold their peace."
Biden won’t let voters forget the truth about Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 9:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bidens-lester-holt-interview-makes-clear-s-not-going-exonerate-trump-rcna161903,"After the failed attempt on his life, Donald Trump says he is a changed man. He told an interviewer that he had set aside the “humdinger” of a speech he planned to give at the Republican  National Convention on Thursday in favor of a new one, focused on unity. “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,” he said.  This call for unity would certainly be a first for the former president, and he might not be lying — at least about that one speech. But should we really believe that we will see a new Trump, committed to a more responsible approach to campaigning, ready to turn his back on the kind of violent, often hateful rhetoric that has characterized his entire tenure in politics? President Joe Biden doesn’t seem to think so. That came through loud and clear in an interview Monday with NBC’s Lester Holt. Even after an Oval Office address in which Biden responded to the attempt on Trump’s life by saying “the political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down. And we all have a responsibility to do that,” the president apparently decided that he would not let Trump off the hook for the way he has made politics so much meaner and angrier over the past eight years.  It was actually rather refreshing. Not because we need to hear candidates criticizing each other more — but because it’s the truth, and even something as disturbing as an assassination attempt shouldn’t make us forget what we’ve seen with our own eyes for so long.  Biden had plenty of material to work with. He began by reiterating, as he often has, that it was Trump’s statement that there were “very fine people on both sides” at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that made him decide to make his third run for the presidency.  To the criticism he got for saying on a private donor call last week (before the shooting) that the campaign should move past the issue of his age and “put Trump in the bull's-eye,” Biden did not hold back. (Notably, after the shooting, Biden explained that he was expressing that “there was very little focus on Trump’s agenda,” and also said it was “a mistake” to have used that word.) “I’m not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one. I’m not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I’m not the guy who said he won’t accept the outcome of this election automatically. You can’t only love your country when you win.” He criticized Trump for saying there will be a “bloodbath” if he loses, and for promising to pardon those convicted of participating in the violent insurrection that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. In short, the message was: If you’re concerned about rhetoric that encourages political violence, the Republican nominee is the one you should talk to. Biden also said something unusual for a Democrat, which I couldn’t help but notice, especially as someone who recently co-wrote a book titled “White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy.” While Democrats are usually at pains to lavish praise on the fine people of the heartland, Biden noted a certain atmosphere often held in the places where Trump gets some of his most fervent support. “I’ve never seen a circumstance where you ride through certain rural areas of the country,” he said, and one can see “signs saying ‘F Biden’ and a little kid standing there putting up his middle finger. That’s the kind of stuff that’s just inflammatory, and a kind of viciousness.” This doesn’t happen only in rural areas, of course, and there are liberals in those places, too. But Biden was absolutely right to point out that Trump has sent a clear message to those who feel, often with good reason, that our changing society and economy has left them and their communities behind. Trump has told them to nurture their resentments, give voice to their anger, and stop being civil to the people they despise. He has told them to hate immigrants and urbanites and Democrats, with all the venom they can muster. And too many of them have responded with a kind of joyful rage, liberated at last to let out their worst selves. That’s why rhetoric is important; not only because it might incite a lone disturbed individual to attempt an assassination but because of what it communicates to everyone else. Trump’s rhetoric until now has been saturated with violence, from his lurid tales of supposed “migrant crime,"" to his gleeful jokes about Nancy Pelosi’s husband almost being murdered by a hammer-wielding assailant, to his suggestions that shoplifters should be shot on sight and that former advisers who have criticized him are guilty of treason, the punishment for which is death.  More than any other political figure in America, Trump instructs his cultish followers not only what to believe but how to think and how to act toward their fellow citizens. Making American politics more cruel and nasty than it had been in decades is an undeniable part of Trump’s legacy.  As the Secret Service began moving him off that stage in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump told them to stop; he turned to the crowd, held up his fist, and mouthed these words: “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Perhaps in the days since, he has had time to reflect and decide that his entire approach to politics has been too harsh and antagonistic. Perhaps in his convention speech he will unveil a kinder, gentler Trump, one committed to national reconciliation and good will even toward those who don’t support him — and not just for one night, but from that day forward.  President Biden doesn’t seem to think so, and it’s hard to disagree given everything we’ve seen for the last eight years. When Trump came into the convention hall Monday night, the crowd responded with a chant that echoed what he said in Pennsylvania: “Fight! Fight! Fight!” No matter what he says in his acceptance speech, they know exactly who he is, and so do we."
It sure isn’t comforting that the person who owns X seems to be going all in for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 9:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-trump-endorsement-x-owner-rcna161860,"Minutes after a Pennsylvania man attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Saturday, the owner of X, Elon Musk, posted on the platform, “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.” The post included a 12-second video of Trump moments after the shooting, surrounded by Secret Service agents, blood smeared across his face and mouthing the word “fight” with his fist in the air. The post was reposted more than 400,000 times.  Reports also indicate Musk is positioning himself to potentially become a colossal GOP donor. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Musk has said he plans to ""commit around $45 million a month"" to a new political action committee backing Trump. Musk’s official endorsement of Trump and his reported interest in becoming a funder underscore his rightward trajectory and evolution into an overtly partisan backer of the GOP. That he chose to make his endorsement with that specific imagery of Trump — bloodied but defiant in a moment of chaos — also implied a kind of interest in Trump’s political project that extends beyond a narrow business calculation. And Musk’s clear favoritism raises questions about whether he could try to use his ownership of the platform X to influence the 2024 elections to tilt the race toward the GOP. Historically, Musk’s ideological views have been all over the map and defied neat explanation. He’s described himself as a moderate and a registered independent; he has expressed libertarian talking points; and he has even called himself a “socialist.” By his own account, he has skewed toward the Democratic presidential candidate in recent cycles — Musk has said that in the last three elections, he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Since the 2000s, he has mostly followed a standard businessman playbook of donating cash to both parties to hedge his bets.    But in the last few years, he has become both more vocal about his political views and swung to the right. His donations have shifted toward the GOP, and in 2022 he said he voted for a Republican candidate for the first time (former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores of Texas, a QAnon-promoting MAGA Republican). After purchasing Twitter, which he has since renamed X, his posts on the platform have become clearly identifiable as sympathetic to right-wing nationalist ideas, including the racist “great replacement theory."" Musk’s showy endorsement of Trump further crystallizes his swing to the MAGA right and suggests his views are less idiosyncratic than they used to be. Musk also has material reasons to favor Trump. As the richest man in the world and a tech investor who complains about taxes, he’d find the tax and regulatory environment more favorable under Trump than under Biden. As someone who owns big companies and is hostile to organized labor, he has reason to oppose Biden, whose National Labor Relations Board appointments have been good for labor power. And given how his companies SpaceX and Tesla have benefited from government contracts and subsidies, it’s possible that he sees a close relationship with the nakedly transactional Trump as a potentially lucrative investment. Musk and Trump have reportedly discussed whether Musk might take on an advisory role to Trump should he re-enter the White House.   The intensity of Musk’s interest in Trump, in turn, raises questions of whether he’d try (or even has tried)  to use his platform to sway the election toward Trump. Social media platforms can play a game-changing role in the political news ecosystem surrounding elections. Platforms such as X, Facebook and Instagram are constantly making decisions about what their algorithms should and shouldn’t amplify, and those decisions are underpinned by value judgments about what kind of information is valuable. All functional platforms, for example, design algorithms to detect and suppress spam and posts that violate company policies on abusive behavior. But algorithms also play a meaningful role in the kinds of content people can see, and this is a realm in which company policy could conceivably be rigged either explicitly or implicitly to favor a candidate or party.  X’s “For you” home page, its recommendations for accounts to follow and its “Explore tab” could theoretically be tweaked to nudge users toward content that skews in a specific ideological direction. While hyperpartisan users are not going to change their minds in the face of content that contradicts their political preferences, the majority of X users are not political junkies, and they could be influenced in subtle ways. Less politically engaged users could be affected, for example, by trends in posts that highlight content critical of Biden’s age or are positive about Trump’s economic policies. (It's also plausible that political journalists' views of what is salient in the race could be subtly shaped by what's in their feeds.) Additionally, given the history of Musk enacting account suspensions and reinstatements in a manner that appears to be related to his political views or interests, it’s conceivable that influential accounts could get suspended or shadow-banned because of their political orientations. And Musk has used flawed and manipulable strategies for dealing with disinformation. Given past meddling by foreign governments and social media operations designed to systematically confuse the public about things as basic as when to vote, Musk at the helm of a social media platform at this moment is worrisome. Will Musk use X as a political weapon in favor of Trump in subtle or overt ways? It’s impossible to know. What we do know is that he increasingly views himself as a right-wing activist and that he has the power do these things. It’s a reminder of how dangerous it is that we have no regulation of social media companies and how acutely vulnerable our civil society is to being hijacked by billionaires who want to reshape the world to their liking."

Jack Smith to appeal Cannon's dismissal of classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 8:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-appeal-aileen-cannon-classified-documents-rcna162082,"UPDATE (July 17, 2024, 3:53 p.m. ET): Special counsel Jack Smith has filed a formal notice that the federal government is appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Special counsel Jack Smith will appeal U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump. That’s unsurprising in the face of Cannon’s outlier ruling in this serious prosecution. But the fact of the appeal — and the special counsel’s statement announcing it — are notable nonetheless. As to the former, the government theoretically had other options, such as refiling the charges in Washington, D.C. Or it could've refiled in Florida through the regular U.S. attorney’s office, which wouldn’t have the appointments clause issue that Cannon found with Attorney General Merrick Garland’s authority to appoint Smith, who isn’t a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney. But in addition to separate legal issues with bringing the case in Washington (which may explain why Smith filed the case in Florida in the first place), going through the regular U.S. attorney in Florida wouldn’t eliminate having to deal with Cannon. Whether she can be removed from the case is a separate issue that could (but won’t necessarily) be addressed with this appeal. Here’s what the special counsel’s office said Monday: The first part of the statement highlights how out of step Cannon’s ruling is, going against the conclusion of other courts that have addressed the appointment issue. The second part is noteworthy in highlighting that the Justice Department authorized the appeal. In her ruling Monday, Cannon took issue with what she characterized as the department's lack of oversight of Smith, so the special counsel’s statement reinforces the point that he can’t just do whatever he wants. Of course, neither of those points guarantee that Smith’s appeal will succeed, especially with the wild card that this Supreme Court has become, demonstrated most recently by the immunity ruling earlier this month. Underscoring that unpredictability, Cannon cited Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence from that case, in which he questioned the legality of Smith’s appointment, which wasn’t even an issue in the immunity appeal. No other justice joined Thomas’ concurrence, but we shouldn't assume from that that Thomas is the only one who would endorse Cannon’s ruling if the case gets to the justices. But Smith’s launching the appeal puts the case on a course to prove Cannon’s ruling the outlier decision that it currently is or to make it the law of the land, courtesy of the Roberts Court.  "
Why Russia has reason to be pleased with Vance on Trump’s ticket,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/russia-reason-pleased-vance-trumps-ticket-rcna162111,"The United States’ European allies were already feeling intense anxiety about the 2024 presidential election, fearing the prospect of having to work with Donald Trump again. On Monday, those fears reached new heights after the former president announced his new running mate. A senior EU official, for example, told Politico that the selection of Sen. JD Vance is “a disaster for Ukraine.” Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger added, in reference to the GOP senator joining his party's ticket, “They are celebrating that choice both in Milwaukee tonight and in Moscow.” To appreciate why, consider this recent column from The Washington Post’s Max Boot, which was published before Trump selected the Ohioan. Vance isn’t the only opponent of U.S. support for Ukraine in his party — the Republican National Convention featured other such critics on the stage Monday night — but he’s arguably the most forceful voice in the GOP’s Senate delegation for abandoning our Ukrainian allies, as evidenced by his opposition to Congress’ bipartisan security aid package that passed in February. An NBC News report added that the senator “has carved out a niche” on the issue, arguing that Ukrainian officials could help end the war by simply giving Russia parts of their country. Vance has also “dismissed concerns that Vladimir Putin would continue his territorial march through Europe if he takes Ukraine.” As recently as April, Vance wrote a New York Times op-ed that argued that a Russian victory is inevitable — a line popular with the Kremlin — so the United States should adjust its policy accordingly. Around the same time, the Senate Republican sat down with CNN’s Jake Tapper and argued that the United States should encourage Ukraine to “take a defensive posture,” instead of launching counteroffensives against their Russian invaders. It fell to the host to remind his guest, “The counteroffensive is within Ukraine, though. They’re not seeking land from Russia.” There’s already evidence to suggest Vladimir Putin’s government has launched a “whole of government” effort to help boost Trump’s candidacy in the 2024 elections. With Vance joining the Republican ticket, it’s likely Moscow will be even more enthusiastic about helping influence the outcome of the race. But there’s also a bigger picture to consider. In recent years, the Republican Party has struggled to settle on a new foreign policy vision, with one intraparty contingent sticking to a traditional GOP vision in which the United States remains a dominant voice in world affairs and takes an unyielding stance in support of democracy, while a Trumpified faction seeks a retreat while expressing sympathies for authoritarian regimes. With Trump and Vance at the top of the GOP ticket, the latter group appears ready to leave the former group behind."
Mitch McConnell gets hostile reception at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 8:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mitch-mcconnell-booed-rnc-trump-criticism-rcna162088,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was booed by the crowd while casting Kentucky's delegate votes Monday, the first day of the Republican National Convention. “Madam chairman, the commonwealth of Kentucky proudly casts 46 votes for the next president, Donald J. Trump,” McConnell said while being drowned out by boos and a smattering of cheers. The Kentucky Republican, who had an uneasy but mutually beneficial relationship with Trump when he was in the White House, has not been a particularly popular figure in the GOP since he acknowledged that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. Although McConnell voted to acquit Trump in his impeachment trial, he excoriated the former president over the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, calling him “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.” Trump has criticized McConnell repeatedly and hurled racist attacks against his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. In February, Trump said he did not know if he could work with McConnell if he was re-elected as president this year. Yet, McConnell had been inching toward reconciliation in recent months, as Trump swept the Republican primary races and most prominent figures in the GOP fell in line. McConnell eventually did so himself, endorsing Trump for president in March. The two men also appeared to set aside their differences at a meeting on Capitol Hill last month after years of not speaking to each other. Still, it's clear from the reception McConnell received Monday that many Republicans have not forgiven — or forgotten — his refusal to cave to Trump immediately after the 2020 election. Once a commanding force in the Senate, McConnell’s influence over the Senate GOP has waned in recent years as Trump’s has grown. Earlier this year, Trump worked to undermine a bipartisan border bill that McConnell had championed. McConnell himself ended up voting against it. Weeks later, the 82-year-old senator announced that he would step down as minority leader in November."
Republican convention tries to rewrite recent history on economy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 7:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-convention-2024-trump-rewrite-history-economy-rcna162102,"Every night of the Republican National Convention will have its own specific theme, and last night the was focus on “Making America Wealthy Again.” Before even hearing the party’s pitch, the label is at odds with the status quo: The United States has the strongest economy on the planet and is currently “the envy of the world.” Nevertheless, that’s not what attendees and viewers heard from Republican convention speakers. “Under President Trump,” Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas declared, “we had the greatest economy in our lifetime.” Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama went further, insisting, “Under President Trump, we had the strongest economy in history. That’s right.” Except, there’s nothing “right” about the claim at all. A Washington Post fact-check piece explained: The Post’s piece actually understates matters. The economy didn’t do as well as it did under Barack Obama, either. Even if we exclude 2020, when the pandemic created a sharp and sudden recession, the story that Republicans prefer to tell about Trump’s economic record is at odds with the facts. The Post published a memorable analysis on this as 2019 neared its end. It’s not what Republicans wanted to hear, but comparing the economy under Obama and Trump at the same points in their presidencies, the Post found that the economy grew faster under Obama, hiring grew faster under Obama, the S&P 500 grew faster under Obama, the unemployment rate shrunk faster under Obama, and the national debt grew slower under Obama. The analysis concluded, “[I]f we are linking economic numbers to presidential performance, Trump’s insistence that his abilities are unparalleled are rendered somewhat suspect in that he ranks second out of the last two presidents on a lot of these indicators.” Remember, all of this was true before the pandemic took a severe toll on the economy. Trump, of course, also ranks behind President Joe Biden, who has a stronger record than his GOP predecessor on job growth, unemployment and economic growth. In other words, at the opening night of the Republican convention, the party was eager to rewrite recent history — something Republicans do with unnerving frequency, as I write about in my soon-to-be-released second book — but the facts are stubborn."
Trump and Vance create a Republican ticket rooted in inexperience,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-create-republican-ticket-rooted-inexperience-rcna162081,"Donald Trump’s 2016 candidacy was unusual in a great many ways, but there was one part of his resume that stood out as extraordinary. Up until January 2017, literally every president in American history had at least some experience in public office, military service, or both. Trump was unique: Before his inauguration, the Republican had never served the public in any capacity. Nevertheless, 46% of the American electorate elevated the former television personality to the nation’s highest and most powerful office. Soon after, the political world confronted a set of circumstances without precedent, at least in the United States: The head of the executive branch in the world’s preeminent superpower didn’t know the basics of how government worked. He sought the presidency without bothering to learn about his own country’s political structures and then arrived in the Oval Office with a child-like understanding of civic affairs. We know this, not just because of Trump’s many failures, but because people close to him have said so on the record. “I’m telling you, he didn’t know anything about government,” former House Speaker Paul Ryan told Politico’s Tim Alberta in 2019. “I wanted to scold him all the time.” Five years later, Trump found himself in the market for a new running mate. The former president chose a young man whose political career is measured in months, not years. Fox News’ Brit Hume told viewers on Monday: The details are striking. While most modern running mates have extensive experience in elected office, Vance’s political career began literally last year. The Ohio senator is the least experienced vice presidential nominee for either party in nearly nine decades. (In 1936, newspaper publisher Frank Knox, who had no background in elected office, joined Alf Landon’s Republican ticket. They soon after lost 46 out of 48 states.) Vance was recently asked about his greatest accomplishment on Capitol Hill, and he pointed to funding in an infrastructure bill he voted against. For Trump, none of this seems to matter. Indeed, if he were principally concerned about qualifications for national office, he wouldn’t have run in the first place. For the Republican Party, the pairing of the least experienced president and the least experienced running mate of the modern era also doesn’t much matter, largely because the contemporary GOP is a post-policy party, indifferent toward governing and policymaking. Looking ahead, the question is whether mainstream American voters are still similarly indifferent."
‘Clear and present danger’: Republican convention abandons ‘unity’ push,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/clear-present-danger-republican-convention-abandons-unity-push-rcna162068,"On Sunday afternoon, the day after being targeted by an assassination attempt, Donald Trump used his social media platform to promote a simple message. “UNITE AMERICA!” the former president wrote. Those who saw this and hoped that the terrifying events in Pennsylvania on Saturday might force a shift in the political climate quickly learned otherwise. On Monday afternoon, Trump published an angry and conspiratorial message that sounded an awful lot like the sort of content the Republican published before the shooting. Soon after, the former president announced his running mate: Sen. JD Vance, a relentlessly partisan lawmaker who, just two days earlier, blamed President Joe Biden and his campaign team for the gunman who targeted Trump. Then the Republican National Convention got underway. As a Washington Post report summarized: Part of the problem with the opening night of the Republican gathering in Milwaukee was the speaker’s list: It included North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, an extremist who recently declared, in reference to his perceived political enemies, “Some folks need killing! It’s time for somebody to say it. It’s not a matter of vengeance. It’s not a matter of being mean or spiteful. It’s a matter of necessity!” Attendees also heard from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a secession proponent who, as recently as this past weekend, said Democrats are “pedophiles” and “flat out evil.” And then, of course, there was the senior senator from the great state of Wisconsin. HuffPost noted: So much for “UNITE AMERICA!” In fairness, it’s worth emphasizing that Johnson — whom The New York Times once described as “the Republican Party’s foremost amplifier of conspiracy theories and disinformation” — told PBS’ Amna Nawaz after his remarks that the teleprompter featured a previous version of his remarks. The GOP senator claimed he intended to deliver a more unifying message, but there was some kind of mix-up. Whether that’s true or not is anyone’s guess, but the bottom line remains the same: The Republican emphasis on “unity” was nice while it lasted, but it didn’t last long."
What history tells us about Trump's attempted assassination,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-presidents-history-rcna161798,"Picture this: A former Republican president is attempting a comeback into politics. Despite leaving office four years ago, he’s busy trying to convince the American people that his successor has been a disappointment. During an event on the campaign trail, a shot rings out as a would-be assassin attempts to end his life. On Saturday, that scene played out for the second time in American history. Former President Theodore Roosevelt survived that 1912 shot, fired as he attempted to mount a strong third-party challenge to return to the White House. So too did former President Donald Trump when a single gunman fired at him during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. It’s a dire reminder that in a country where political violence is never too far from the forefront of the nation’s consciousness, and guns remain widely available, those campaigning for the highest office in the land have long been considered prime targets. While Trump’s wound was reportedly superficial, a few inches to the left would have likely been deadly. The latter was also true for Roosevelt, who was shot in the chest by his assailant. It was only thanks to the items in his jacket pocket — the 50 pages of his prepared remarks, folded once, and his steel eyeglass case — that the bullet was slowed. Though Trump was rushed offstage, Roosevelt concluded that the bullet had not pierced anything important. He then continued to deliver an off-the-cuff speech for close to an hour, only being taken for medical treatment afterward. Roosevelt himself first ascended to the presidency because of an assassin’s bullet. He was vice president when President William McKinley was shot by an anarchist in 1901 while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The resulting wound turned gangrenous thanks to poor handling from doctors, leaving Roosevelt the youngest president in history. Decades later, Teddy’s distant cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt was the target of another would-be assassin. A month before he was sworn in as president in 1933, a man fired six shots at the car carrying the president-elect; Roosevelt was unscathed, but five other people were hit, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who would later die from his wounds. Despite the attempt on Teddy Roosevelt’s life, Secret Service protection was only extended to former presidents in 1965. That level of security was only extended to “major presidential candidates” in 1968 when Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., was assassinated while campaigning for the presidency. (His son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was assigned Secret Service protection for his long shot independent presidential campaign on Monday.) But the Secret Service agents assigned to protect Alabama Gov. George Wallace when he campaigned for the Democratic nomination in 1972 weren’t enough to prevent an attempted assassination that left Wallace paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. We still don’t know the motives of the shooter who fired at Trump. The motives of other assassins or would-be assassins of presidential candidates are a mixed bag. For some, like Kennedy’s assassin Sirhan Sirhan, there has been a distinct political target, in his case Kennedy’s support for Israel. Others, like the man who shot Wallace, literally did it for the fame, or infamy, involved in trying to kill a famous figure. John Schrank, the person who tried to kill Theodore Roosevelt, did so because he claimed McKinley’s ghost told him that Roosevelt had murdered McKinley and ordered Schrank to avenge his death. We also can’t easily use the past to judge what effect this incident will have on the election. Tony Diver, The Telegraph’s U.S. editor, looked to the shooting of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 as a touchstone. Reagan had only been in office for less than a year when John Hinckley Jr. shot him in a delusional attempt to win the attention of actor Jodie Foster. “If history tells us anything, the events of Saturday will only increase his support,” Diver wrote. “In the months after Mr Reagan was shot, the newly-elected Republican president saw a poll boost of eight points.” While that may have been the last credible assassination attempt on a president, there are a lot of differences here that make me skeptical about the bounce Trump might see. For one, no matter what has happened to him, there’s always been a ceiling for him in the polls and a floor from his die-hard supporters. In addition, the “rally around the flag” effect that often occurs after an attempt on a sitting president’s life is less frequently seen when the target is a candidate for the office, even one who has held the job before. Both Roosevelt and Wallace lost their presidential races. In the end, there are only two main things that unite all the attempts on presidential candidates’ lives. The first, and most within our grasp to change, is access to guns in this country. The other, though, is harder to address. Every assassination undertaken or attempted, whether for personal glory or ideology, can rightly be seen as an attack on a symbol. For what else is a candidate for the presidency but a symbol of what the country might next be? It is the reaction to the attack on that symbol that they seek, be it praise and attention, or to spark a revolution. It’s not yet clear what reaction the man who fired at Trump wanted when he pulled the trigger — but I fear it won’t be long before we find out what tinderbox he hit as well."
Judge Cannon’s latest ruling proves the judiciary has become MAGAfied,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-cannon-classified-documents-ruling-supreme-court-rcna162010,"On Monday, in an opinion that was shocking both for its reasoning and its timing, Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Mar-a-Lago classified documents prosecution against former President Donald Trump. She declared that Jack Smith’s appointment as special counsel is unlawful under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. Even given Cannon’s clear bias and reckless handling of the case from the outset, this development is jaw-dropping. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s anything-goes majority opinion on presidential immunity, we are witnessing the “MAGAfication” of the judiciary, joining Donald Trump in the march toward lawlessness. It should be met with repudiation by voters come November. Fittingly, Cannon has bookended her handling of this matter with the worst decisions we have seen a district court judge make in our collective half-century-plus of legal practice. In both instances, she bent over backward to help Trump avoid accountability.  Back in 2022, before Trump was indicted, Cannon attempted to interfere with the government’s ongoing investigation by appointing a special master to review documents seized from Mar-a-Lago under a search warrant. That move was completely baseless — and the conservative 11th Circuit swiftly ordered an end to her unprecedented intervention into a criminal investigation.  Now Cannon has again deviated from the law to dismiss the case entirely. Embracing a theory that has never been adopted by any court, Cannon found that Smith’s appointment was not authorized by Congress and so violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. She went on to hold that the appropriation of funds to the special counsel was similarly inappropriate.  That interpretation ignores both Supreme Court precedent and the plain text of the statutes that authorize the appointment of the special counsel. In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the Watergate special prosecutor’s subpoena of President Richard Nixon’s Oval Office tapes. In reaching that conclusion, the court explained that Congress had “the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist [the attorney general] in the discharge of his duties,” including the special prosecutor, through precisely the same statutes that authorize Smith’s appointment. Every other court that has ruled on the issue in the 50 years since then has agreed. Just five years ago, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals cited the Nixon case in unanimously upholding the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. But Cannon discarded that unbroken line of precedent. Instead, she concluded that a statute that says “the Attorney General may appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States” does not authorize the attorney general to appoint a special counsel to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States. This is not a conservative, textualist legal decision grounded in a careful reading of the statute. It is shameless judicial activism with no other basis than to immunize Trump from accountability. So what does Smith do now? Already, the special counsel’s office has announced he will promptly appeal Cannon’s ruling to the 11th Circuit. That court has reversed Cannon before when she dramatically departed from precedent, and another prompt reversal is warranted here. But regardless, the appeal will most likely end up at the Supreme Court.  Smith can also go one step further and seek Cannon’s removal from the case entirely. That rarely happens, and the Justice Department seldom reaches for such an extraordinary intervention. But we think the extraordinary circumstances of this case warrant it.  Under 11th Circuit precedent, “[r]eassignment is appropriate where the trial judge has engaged in conduct that gives rise to the appearance of impropriety or a lack of impartiality in the mind of a reasonable member of the public.” Even when the trial court judge has not shown “actual bias,” as the 11th Circuit termed it, the judge can still be removed from a case when “the original judge would have difficulty putting his previous views and findings aside” or if “reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of justice.”  As we have previously argued, Cannon’s handling of the case betrayed bias sufficient to support removal even before Monday’s decision. After this ruling, Smith should seek a reassignment in the interests of justice. All of this could happen fairly quickly. The 11th Circuit acted briskly when Cannon overstepped last time, and we could see action within a matter of weeks. That suggests that this could all come to a head during the election season — as if we needed one more destabilizing turn of events on this political roller coaster. Looming over all of this, though, is the devastation the conservative members of the Supreme Court have unleashed. The high court has now shifted the Overton window of lawless judging with its recent immunity ruling. The conservative justices set the bad example that Cannon has now followed. What might the Supreme Court do if the government’s appeal of Cannon’s disastrous opinion reaches its steps? Even now, it is hard to believe that a majority of the court would embrace Cannon’s unprincipled, atextualist conclusion. But at least one justice would. In the court’s immunity decision, Justice Clarence Thomas issued a concurring opinion — joined by no other justice — questioning the constitutionality of the special counsel position. The issue was not before the court, and none of the parties had even briefed it. Yet, in an all-too-predictable act of judicial brazenness, Thomas opined anyway.  Cannon cited Thomas’ solo concurrence as if it were law while disregarding the Supreme Court’s long-standing precedent as if it were purely optional. It is hard to imagine a clearer encapsulation of MAGA judicial philosophy: The law as they find it is irrelevant; all that matters is what Trump’s hand-picked justices decide they want the law to be. Maybe that would be a bridge too far, even for this court. The court’s precedent and the statute’s text are crystal clear. So it is possible that the Supreme Court will slap Cannon’s ruling down — as it has done with other rogue conservative district court judges this term who far exceeded their parameters. But the Supreme Court has become unmoored. Beyond defying the text and spirit of the Constitution in their immunity ruling, it has also thrown out the foundational legal principle of stare decisis, in which courts adhere to precedent. It has overruled long-settled law on everything from the role of administrative agencies to abortion. We must view Cannon’s latest entry in the continuing partisan politicization of our courts together with all of the destabilizing events of the past four years. That starts with the attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, the tragedy of Jan. 6 and Trump and his allies’ authoritarian threats, which we catalog in our American Autocracy Threat Tracker. And it includes the violence targeting political figures including Trump, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, We are now facing the most serious internal challenge to the American experiment since the Jim Crow era, or perhaps the Civil War. (That crisis is the subject of a major cross-partisan summit that we are hosting next week at NYU.) Cannon’s decision and its naked unlawfulness need to be located in that context. The court’s immunity ruling was a form of election interference, slow-rolling the case to make a trial in 2024 impossible. But the content and the timing of Cannon’s decision here are perhaps even more blatant. Dropping this opinion on the morning the Republican convention begins is a political gift to the man who nominated her and an unmistakable signal of her bias. Whatever this is, it is not judging as we have known it. "
How JD Vance passed Trump’s running mate litmus test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:38 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 4:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-test-rcna161985,"Donald Trump named Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate after Vance spent two years echoing the former president's baseless claims about the 2020 election. Vance was the most vocal election denier among Trump's small circle of finalists, having claimed without evidence since his 2022 run for the Senate that the election was stolen. Republicans who have raised concerns about the 2020 election range from those who say that they did not like how certain voting rules were changed because of the pandemic to those who make baseless allegations that the election was stolen. Vance has made arguments along the entire spectrum: Looking ahead to November, it's worth noting that Vance also echoed something that Trump has said when asked if he would accept the election results in the past. ""If it's a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results,"" Vance told CNN's Dana Bash in May. ""And again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president."" Vance was more diplomatic when asked if he would accept a loss in his own Senate race, however, stating that he had confidence in Ohio's elections. “I expect to win,” he said at a Fox News town hall just days before the 2022 election. “But, of course, if things don’t go the way that I expect, I’ll support the guy who wins and I’ll try to be as supportive as I possibly can.” Election denial is also a major reason the position of Trump's running mate was open in the first place. After then-Vice President Mike Pence refused Trump's request to object to electors on Jan. 6, 2021, the two had a falling out, and the angry mob that descended on the Capitol threatened to ""hang Mike Pence."" Congress has since updated the Electoral Count Act to clarify that the vice president's role in the proceedings is strictly ceremonial. But Vance has also made clear that he might be willing to cross a line that Pence wouldn't, and that may have helped him get the job."
This isn't the end for Trump's classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/special-counsel-trump-documents-jack-smith-dismissed-rcna161978,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 15 episode of ""José Díaz-Balart Reports."" The constitutionality of the special counsel position is an issue that has been litigated for many years, but no court has ever done what U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon did Monday. With her decision to dismiss the federal classified documents case against Donald Trump and rule special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment unlawful, Cannon has found herself on a legal island. Federal courts in the District of Columbia have clearly established case law on this issue, so Cannon’s decision in Florida should not have any immediate ramifications for Smith’s federal election interference case in D.C. But Monday’s decision isn’t exactly the end of the Florida case either. The Justice Department has already authorized the special counsel to appeal the order, and I expect that appeal to be heard. However, that route will take some time: a briefing schedule, oral argument and an eventual decision from an appellate court could be months away. There is another, faster option on the table. Technically the Department of Justice could dismiss their case in the Southern District of Florida — although Judge Cannon has already done that for them — and refile elsewhere, like the District of Columbia. Venue, the place where a crime occurs, is an elastic concept. Many crimes occur in multiple places. I think there is a good faith argument that the classified documents case could have also been filed in the District of Columbia, where the crime is alleged to have begun, but that theory might invite a separate set of challenges.  All that said, I caution the Department of Justice to take into consideration the optics here. It's a bad look for the DOJ to judge-shop. That puts the department in a bad light. Typically, in litigation you are stuck with the judge you get — sometimes that’s a good draw, and other times it’s a bad draw. In my experience as a federal prosecutor, it’s mostly been good draws but, when you do get a bad draw, the only option is to carry on and do your job. As we wait for Jack Smith's next move, one thing seems likely: what lies ahead is a long, hard slog for the Department of Justice."
