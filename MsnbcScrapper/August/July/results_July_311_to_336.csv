Kremlin echoes some Trump allies on assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-assassination-attempt-conspiracy-theories-kremlin-putin-rcna161902,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s allies in the Kremlin have already begun pushing propaganda about the shooting this weekend at a Donald Trump rally.  A top Kremlin official argued without evidence that an assassination attempt that killed a spectator and injured two others was the fault of President Joe Biden and his allies. For now, there’s little information on the gunman's motivations, and the FBI has said that it has not yet determined his underlying ideology or motive. Nonetheless, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “the atmosphere that has been created by this administration during the political struggle, the atmosphere around the candidate Trump, prompted what America is facing today,"" according to the Russian state media outlet TASS. Business Insider reported on Peskov’s extended comments, which echoed claims made by some Republican lawmakers, including Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, who also alleged, without evidence, that anti-Trump rhetoric was to blame for the shooting. Peskov said, according to Business Insider: Still, Peskov added that Moscow does not believe the assassination attempt ""was organized by the current authorities."" Back here in reality, of course, the blame for Trump's various court cases, convictions and condemnation rests entirely on his own behavior. Still, some Trump allies have used the shooting as an opportunity to push back on his critics. And the Kremlin is moving in lockstep with them."
Judge Aileen Cannon cleaned up her own mess by making a new one,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 2:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-jack-smith-rcna161887,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has much more free time on her hands now. Last week, her calendar was packed with hearings and pending motions in former President Donald Trump’s federal classified documents case. But on Monday she issued a sweeping ruling dismissing the case and finding that special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed in the process. The 93-page ruling puts an end — for now — to what had once been seen as the strongest case against Trump. It also cleans up — again, for now — the mess that Cannon had made for herself in her halting, hesitant and ultimately horrific handling of the case. But in issuing this ruling, Cannon has created an even larger problem for Smith and the judges who will have to contend with her reasoning in future appeals. That process is sure to be lengthy, because the scope of Cannon’s ruling would essentially negate both federal cases against Trump in their entirety. Cannon’s decision to grant a motion to dismiss was a surprise, one of many she has pulled out over the 13 months since she was assigned the case. The hearing at which the motion was argued before her last month was viewed as odd from the moment it was announced, though it was another in a long line of delays that Cannon had already caused by giving undue credulity to whatever claims were tossed her way. The resulting backlog of motions requiring judgment had meant that even before Monday, no trial date had been set, even though proceedings were initially scheduled to begin in May. Last month’s hearing was particularly strange, however, because Cannon allowed arguments from outside parties beyond Trump’s lawyers and Smith’s prosecutors. The pro-Trump argument boiled down to an attack on special prosecutors broadly, albeit targeting Smith specifically. It claimed that the Department of Justice’s special counsel regulations, under which Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith, violated the Constitution. The pro-Trump lawyers argued that the independence vested in Smith’s position made him a “principal officer,” thus requiring Senate confirmation under the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. They further argued that Smith’s office was improperly drawing on Justice Department appropriations without Congress’ specifically authorizing that spending, violating the Appropriations Clause. In fairness, the special counsel regulations have always a bit awkward. They were drafted to replace Congress’ independent counsel statute, which was passed post-Watergate but allowed to expire in 1999. By then both parties had agreed that, despite the Supreme Court’s upholding the law authorizing the independent counsel in 1988, the post was too unwieldy to be functional. Politicians sought a replacement that still allowed for autonomy without becoming an unaccountable fourth branch of government. The Justice Department lawyers who authored the rules drew on various statutes to grant the attorney general the power to appoint a special counsel who “shall be selected from outside the United States Government” for cases in which a typical U.S. attorney would “present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances.” The resulting regulations have been invoked in both Democratic and Republican administrations with little to indicate that they might be unconstitutional. A court challenge against special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, named by then-President George W. Bush to investigate the Valerie Plame leak, that made similar Appointment Clause arguments was rejected by a district court judge in 2006. Special counsel Robert Mueller, named to oversee the Russia investigation during the Trump administration, was also given a green light in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit deemed his appointment was likewise constitutional. Cannon dismissed those prior rulings in her decision, along with Smith’s arguments that his role is as an “inferior officer” who is accountable to the attorney general. Instead, she sided with a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas in the Supreme Court’s decision that granted Trump broad immunity in the federal case relating to his alleged 2020 election interference. (She also ruled against Smith on the Appropriations Clause challenge, but since the Appointments Clause decision was enough to dismiss the case did not go as in-depth in her analysis.) Canon’s ruling also cuts off the chance that a newly named special counsel, one who is already a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney, could simply pick up where Smith left off. Instead, under her ruling Smith’s investigation would now be invalidated, as he was never legally authorized to conduct it. And while the ruling doesn’t directly affect the election interference case in Washington, as it is not binding on the judge overseeing it, it provides a new method to stall those proceedings even further once they’re finally resumed. Given that courts have seen no issue with special counsel appointments in the past, it’s uncertain whether a more experienced judge would have ruled the same way as Cannon. Her short time on the bench has been a major reason for the delays in the case, as her meticulous approach has led to packing her schedule with motions many jurists would dismiss as dilatory or rule on swiftly without a hearing. The New York Times even reported last month that several more experienced judges in Cannon’s district suggested that she hand off the case when it was initially assigned to her at random. She declined, despite her lack of trial experience, leading us to Monday’s dismissal. It’s unclear whether this ruling will stand up in the face of scrutiny at the appellate level. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a decision of hers early in Smith’s investigation with an unusual degree of scorn for her legal reasoning. There’s still a chance that her decision is reversed, but it’s likely she’d remain on the case. This would place her right back in the same spot as before, with a lengthy list of motions to consider before a trial date could be set and a jury could be impaneled. At the same time, it is frustratingly fitting that this would be the way that Cannon finally answers the calls from observers to act swiftly. In fact, it feels almost petty that she would grab at this off-ramp when it was presented to her after stubbornly refusing to admit that she’s in over her head. Rather than act decisively on issues that would clearly fail under scrutiny, she has instead in one fell swoop taken the most promising chance presented to her to wash her hands of the matter altogether."

Black voter advocacy group denounces efforts to push Biden off the ticket,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 1:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/black-voters-matter-biden-drop-out-democrats-rcna161953,"A top voting rights group has issued a scathing rebuke of Democrats who’ve been pressuring President Joe Biden to end his 2024 campaign after a poor debate performance. And it packs a punch. Black Voters Matter is one of the pre-eminent Black voter advocacy and mobilization groups in the country. In the statement, the group’s leaders accused liberal elites of leading the effort to oust Biden and said that doing so would undermine the democratic process by overruling Black primary voters, many of whom have dedicated their time and energy to re-electing the Biden-Harris administration. The statement, written by Black Voters Matter co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright, along with the group’s national legal director, April England-Albright, says the Biden-Harris administration has delivered on promises to invest in Black communities, implement police accountability, fund historically Black colleges and universities, and more. But they wrote that “the recent nervous cry for Biden to step aside” is being “led largely by white congresspeople, pundits, and donors” and add that it threatens to “mute and overlook the voices of Black Voters.” The sentiment reflects a palpable irritation I’ve detected from Black folks lately — journalists and otherwise — as they’ve watched some in the media push for Biden to drop out or cite polls that they believe indicate he should, when that hasn’t seemed to match what many Democrats, especially Black Democrats, say when asked face-to-face. Ditching the Biden-Harris ticket could negatively “impact Black turnout for decades to come while deepening the widespread belief that the Democratic Party takes our voters for granted,” Black Voters Matter argues. The statement speaks to frustrations that the calls to replace Biden have generally been made without articulating realistic plans for how voter mobilization groups could re-educate voters about whatever fantasy ticket these Democrats want instead. Admittedly, it’s a thought that’s come to mind as I’ve read and heard about what I feel are far-fetched scenarios for a change atop the ticket. Because despite what George Clooney or James Carville might want, for example, I don’t think they’re going to be knocking on doors to turn out the vote. The statement addresses this: The group’s leaders make clear they’re not denouncing people who voice principled policy disagreements with the Biden administration. They write: The statement ends with a call to “[b]uckle up, do the work, have some courage and stay the course to create the society and the world we all need and deserve.” You should really read the statement in full. I think the Blacklash toward those who have been driving the “Biden drop out” campaign is an underreported story these days. At minimum, it seems to have saved the Biden-Harris campaign from a feeding frenzy."

How Cannon ditched the Nixon case to dismiss Trump's documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 1:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cannon-nixon-trump-case-dismissed-rcna161936,"In 1974, the Supreme Court seemingly approved a special prosecutor’s authority in then-President Richard Nixon’s case over the Watergate tapes subpoena. But in dismissing the classified documents case against Donald Trump on Monday, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon rejected language from that Supreme Court ruling to find that Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel against the former president.  How could she have done so? Putting aside for a moment that she may be reversed on appeal, the answer lies in something called dicta, meaning language in an opinion that isn’t necessary to the ruling. Cannon deemed the language at issue from the Nixon case to be that sort of statement that isn’t binding precedent.    Here’s the relevant passage from United States v. Nixon in 1974 that she excerpted in her ruling dismissing Trump’s indictment:  Cannon emphasized that ""the focal point of the parties’ dispute"" regarding Smith's appointment is the line: ""It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties. 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, 510, 515, 533."" She noted the defense argued that the language from Nixon about the attorney general’s authority “is non-binding dictum and thus should not control the Court’s statutory analysis,” while Smith said that it was necessary to the case’s holding and is therefore binding on lower courts. Rejecting Smith’s approach, Cannon wrote that the attorney general’s authority in the Nixon case “was not raised, briefed, argued, or disputed before the Nixon Court” and that the Supreme Court at most assumed that the attorney general had authority without expressly ruling on it. Therefore, the Trump appointee wrote, “Nixon’s passing remarks on that point are not binding precedent.” Cannon further said that she disagreed with rulings from the D.C. federal appeals court that approvingly cited Nixon, including a 2019 ruling against a challenge to special counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment. Cannon sits in a different federal circuit (the 11th, which reversed her during previous Trump-related litigation), so she isn’t bound by D.C. Circuit precedent. Notably, Cannon cited Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence from the immunity ruling in Trump’s favor earlier this month, where Thomas said that the Nixon case only “gave passing reference to the cited statutes” and “provided no analysis of those provisions’ text.” No other justices joined Thomas’ concurrence, but the appointment issue wasn’t directly before the justices in the immunity case, so we don't know how they would rule if the issue were argued before them. Thomas had joined Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion bestowing broad criminal immunity but wrote separately to raise the appointment issue. Ultimately, the Supreme Court may have to weigh in on what its own precedent means. Of course, if the appointment issue gets to the high court, the question isn’t only what a majority of the court thinks Nixon meant, but, perhaps more importantly, what a majority of the court wants to do in Trump's case today. The immunity ruling reminds us that, especially in cases involving presidential power, we’ll never know for sure what the court will do until it rules.

Donald Trump taps Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his 2024 running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 12:33 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-taps-ohio-sen-jd-vance-2024-running-mate-rcna161965,"The “race to the bottom” in Republican politics in recent months has been difficult to watch. One GOP official after another, desperate to impress Donald Trump and ingratiate themselves to the former president’s team, went to cringeworthy lengths in the hopes of improving their odds of becoming the former president’s new running mate. One candidate, however, was especially brazen in abandoning any sense of shame or self-respect. In February, for example, Sen. JD Vance publicly suggested that presidents should be willing to disregard Supreme Court rulings they deem “illegitimate,” adding that he would’ve rejected the 2020 election results on Jan. 6 if he’d been vice president at the time. Soon after, the Ohio Republican said, in reference to the Trump-inspired attack on the Capitol, “I’m truly skeptical that Mike Pence’s life was ever in danger.” In a separate interview around the same time, Vance also said that he planned to accept the 2024 election results, but only if they met the Ohio Republican’s undefined standards. The senator then tried to defend Trump’s Jan. 6 efforts in a way that was widely panned as “ridiculous.” Remarking on the intraparty competition last month, The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank wrote: “To date, Vance has arguably demeaned himself the most. ... If sycophancy is the measure, Vance is clearly the leading contestant.” The party’s presumptive presidential nominee apparently came to the same conclusion. My MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim reported: There’s no great mystery as to how Vance excelled as a vice presidential contender: The Ohioan is a partisan attack dog with deep ties to deep pockets. Indeed, the senator’s career included a stint in the venture capital sector, and it’s likely that Trump is eager to exploit those ties to boost his fundraising. As the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance might also be positioned to help the Republican ticket target voters in key Midwestern battleground states. There are plenty of downsides for Vance — after just a year and a half in elected office, he has no accomplishments to speak of, and he’s the least experienced vice presidential nominee for either party in nearly nine decades — but those aren’t the kind of concerns that bother the former president. What Trump does care about is sycophantic support, and on that front, Vance is a recent convert. As a Washington Post report noted last week, during Trump’s 2016 candidacy, Vance called himself “a Never Trump guy” and said he didn’t vote for him in 2016. The same year, Vance wrote, “Mr. Trump is unfit for our nation’s highest office.” The Post’s article added: In 2016, Vance also wrote a piece for The Atlantic, which argued, “Trump is cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it.” The future senator added at the time, “What Trump offers is an easy escape from the pain. To every complex problem, he promises a simple solution. ... He never offers details for how these plans will work, because he can’t. Trump’s promises are the needle in America’s collective vein.” We’ll never know for sure whether Vance underwent an ideological metamorphosis for the sake of political convenience, or because of a sincere conversion to MAGAism. Either way, one of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics from eight years ago is now his 2024 running mate."
Trump picks political newcomer JD Vance as running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 12:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-pick-rcna159005,"Donald Trump has picked Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential running mate, a decision that would potentially elevate a novice lawmaker to the position of the second-most powerful person in the United States. Trump announced his decision in a Truth Social post on Monday, the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. ""As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,"" Trump wrote. ""Congratulations to Senator J.D. Vance, his wife, Usha, who also graduated from Yale Law School, and their three beautiful children. MAGA2024!"" Out of the reported front-runners for the ticket, Vance, 39, has the least experience in elected office. Before he was sworn into the Senate in January 2023, the military veteran and law school graduate worked as an author and a venture capitalist. Vance sharply criticized Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election, privately comparing him to Adolf Hitler and publicly describing him as ""noxious"" and ""reprehensible."" But Vance's 180 on the former president during his Senate campaign — and his friendship with Trump's oldest son — eventually earned him a spot in Trump's good graces. Vance openly jockeyed to be Trump's running mate. He made a slate of media appearances as a Trump surrogate, he fervently attacked witnesses in the former president's New York hush money trial, and he acted as a sort of conduit between his Silicon Valley connections and Trump. Vance said in an interview in late June that he would be disappointed if he wasn't picked to join Trump's ticket. Vance is known as one of the most MAGA-aligned Republicans in the Senate. Like the presumptive GOP nominee, he has championed an extreme brand of conservatism. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Daily last month: Although the FBI has not yet determined the shooter’s ideology, Vance immediately blamed President Joe Biden for the attempted assassination of Trump at a campaign rally on Saturday, claiming that the president's campaign rhetoric accusing Trump of being ""an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs"" led to the attack. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
Monday's interview with NBC News' Lester Holt is Joe Biden’s chance to flip the script,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 11:12 AM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 11:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-interview-nbc-news-lester-holt-rcna161944,"The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump will no doubt be the subject of the first question NBC News’ Lester Holt asks President Joe Biden during a previously scheduled interview that will air Monday evening. However, that doesn’t mean the focus will be taken off the ongoing feud within the Democratic Party and whether Biden should be its nominee against Trump. The calls for Biden to step aside have quieted over the last couple of days, but they will return. It’s been more than two weeks since the president’s horrible debate performance against Trump; it’s time for him to flip the script, and Monday’s interview with Holt is the perfect time and place for him to do it. Since that debate, Biden has been working to assure the country that he is up to the job. Yet, his biggest obstacle appears to be a small but growing group of Democrats who are pressuring him to bow out of the race. Some have explicitly called for him to step aside. Then there are those such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who are chumming the waters with snide comments like, “I want him to do whatever he decides to do.” While it took far too long, Biden finally addressed the American public by doing a one-on-one interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Since then, the president has been on the campaign trail and at long last, on Thursday, he had his first solo news conference of 2024. Each step of the way, Biden has managed to marginally calm fears about his fitness and his ability to win re-election. He has done this by being conciliatory and has shown a willingness to address these issues, going as far as to say, “I think it’s important that I allay fears by letting them see me out there.” The next step is for Biden to demonstrate that he is in charge and call for an end to the brewing rebellion once and for all. While Biden carried the right tone during the ABC interview, he must mix it up in the NBC interview. If Biden wants to be re-elected, then he needs to project strength, show he is in command and, most of all, be bold. Here’s what the president should be thinking about: Although Biden’s perceived frailty may connote weakness, he should use this interview to show power. If fueled with the right words, his softer voice will roar with strength. While typically Biden would use this moment for a pre-convention attack on Trump, he should now use it to express the need for unity. As he said in his address to the nation Sunday night, “While we might disagree, we are not enemies … we are fellow Americans. And we must stand together.”"
"In the shooting’s wake, Trump’s shift in tone fades quickly",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shootings-wake-trumps-shift-tone-fades-quickly-rcna161939,"Axios reported Monday morning that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Donald Trump in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added: “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America, when the Republican convention opens Monday in Milwaukee.” A few hours later, the former president stepped all over this reporting, publishing this missive to his social media platform: For now, let’s not spend a lot of time pointing out every individual error of fact and judgment in the Republican’s missive. Fair-minded observers already know, for example, that the indictment in the classified documents case wasn’t “illegal” and that Jan. 6 wasn’t a “hoax.” What stood out as notable in this 123-word missive was how predictably Trumpy it was. The idea that the Republican would be “toning down his Trumpiness” in the wake of Saturday’s shooting in Pennsylvania is belied by the fact that his missive was effectively identical to everything he’s been saying for months. The former president pushed baseless conspiracy theories, targeted writer E. Jean Carroll in ways his defense counsel would probably advise against, peddled a familiar-but-nonsensical claim about his alleged election interference efforts in Georgia, and so on. What’s the tonal difference between Trump’s message this morning and the GOP candidate’s standard rhetoric from recent months? There is no tonal difference. Around this time yesterday, Trump published an item that read, simply, “UNITE AMERICA!” In light of Monday’s missive, it’s hardly unreasonable to wonder whether he defines “unity” as everyone agreeing with his conspiratorial vision and his desire to avoid accountability for wrongdoing."

Josh Shapiro said Comperatore dived on his family to protect them and had “died a hero.” The Democratic governor called Comperatore an avid Trump follower who had been excited to be at the rally. “Corey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. And most especially, Corey loved his family,” Shapiro said. President Joe Biden also praised Comperatore on Sunday. “He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired,” Biden said at a White House news conference. “And he lost his life. God love him.” Two other rallygoers from Pennsylvania were reported to have been critically injured in the shooting: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township.

"Biden, Warnock thread a needle, contextualize political violence",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 9:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-warnock-thread-needle-contextualize-political-violence-rcna161930,"The morning after the attempted assassination targeting Donald Trump, Sen. Raphael Warnock did what the Georgia Democrat does just about every Sunday: He delivered a sermon from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Not surprisingly, Warnock condemned the shooting, prayed for the former president’s well-being and said how thankful he was that Trump wasn’t seriously hurt. But Warnock also took some time to widen the aperture. As a Washington Post report noted, Warnock said the man who tried to kill Trump “was no patriot — and neither were the people who attacked our Capitol and assaulted police officers and tried to stop the nonviolent transfer of political power on Jan. 6.” The senator added, “They are cut from the same cloth. We must cry foul, we must call out the hypocrisy of anybody who would try to condone one and condemn the other.” These comments came to mind hours later, as President Joe Biden delivered an Oval Office address that touched on a very similar message. Like Warnock, the Democratic president condemned the attempt on his rival’s life, and like the senator, Biden also took care to contextualize the violence. From the transcript: Biden moments later, “There is no place in America for this kind of violence or for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.” This is a tricky needle to thread. On the one hand, Biden and his allies have been categorical in denouncing the assassination attempt. Democratic officials have steered clear of finger-pointing and conspiracy theories, recognizing the seriousness of the shooting and the importance of condemning what happened in no uncertain terms. On the other hand, the incumbent president and his allies also want to remind the public that a responsible part of any conversation about political violence is Trump’s own record. As recently as a few months ago, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee sat down with Time magazine and was asked about the possibility of post-election violence. Trump replied, “If we don’t win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election.” This wasn’t an isolated incident. Even Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, explained in 2016 that Trump had “a consistent pattern of inciting violence.” In the years that followed, during and after his term, Trump repeatedly offered evidence to bolster the thesis. When an attacker targeted Pelosi’s home, Trump went after the House speaker emerita and peddled ridiculous conspiracy theories. When extremists plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Trump launched an offensive against the Democratic governor and described the plot as “fake.” (Juries disagreed.) Trump wasn't just responsible for Jan. 6 violence, he’s basing part of his campaign on championing the interests of rioters. Biden and Warnock took care to connect the dots. The point isn’t to downplay the indefensible attempt on Trump’s life; the point is to argue that political violence is always wrong, even when Trump suggests otherwise. It’s a relevant detail as the public conversation continues."
Judge Aileen Cannon dismisses Trump classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 7:12 AM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 9:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-case-rcna161879,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Donald Trump on Monday. The Trump appointee wrote that special counsel Jack Smith's appointment ""violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."" The ruling followed a hearing on the subject in which Trump and his supporters pressed that argument. In the Supreme Court immunity ruling earlier this month, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion raising questions about the lawfulness of Smith's appointment, which Cannon cited in her ruling dismissing the case against the former president. The appointments clause states: Citing that provision, Cannon concluded that Attorney General Merrick Garland didn’t have the authority to appoint Smith, who isn’t a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney. The bottom line of her lengthy opinion is that:   Cannon separately found another constitutional violation regarding Smith’s funding, under the Constitution’s appropriations clause, which the defense also raised in the hearing. Smith can appeal the dismissal and the Supreme Court may ultimately determine the lawfulness of Smith's appointment. No other justices joined Thomas' opinion but Smith's appointment wasn't at issue in the immunity case, so it's unclear how many other justices may agree with Thomas. Trump was charged last year with unlawfully retaining national defense information and obstruction. He pleaded not guilty. He was charged alongside two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who also pleaded not guilty. The case's dismissal applies to them as well. Smith brought the federal charges in the Southern District of Florida, where Cannon sits. She was randomly assigned to the criminal case, as is customary. But her assignment was notable because she had ruled for Trump during previous litigation following the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. Cannon was reversed during that litigation by the federal appeals court that could also review her dismissal of the indictment if Smith appeals. Monday’s dismissal is an escalation of Cannon’s unusual handling of the case that had largely favored Trump to this point, raising questions about both her lack of experience and her disposition toward the former president who appointed her. Cannon had been handling motions slowly and there wasn’t an active trial date when she dismissed the case. So it already wasn’t likely to be tried before the election and, if Trump wins the election, he’s poised to get rid of both of his federal criminal cases himself. The question now, if Trump loses the election, is whether it will ever go forward, and whether Smith will seek to convince the appeals court to remove Cannon from the case in connection with any appeal he takes. But even if Cannon’s dismissal is reversed on appeal, that doesn’t mean that an appeals court would necessarily kick her off the case. So there’s a scenario in which Smith could get the dismissal reversed on appeal but the case would then go back to Cannon, where she would still need to rule on many other pretrial issues before any trial could go forward.

Republicans press Dems to stop calling Trump a threat to democracy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 8:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-press-dems-stop-calling-trump-threat-democracy-rcna161894,"After the assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump, many of his Republican allies didn’t just blame Democrats for the gunman, they also pointed to a very specific line of criticism. As a HuffPost report summarized: Johnson had plenty of company. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise added that Democrats have been “fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America.” Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina claimed that the shooting in Pennsylvania was “aided and abetted by the radical Left and corporate media incessantly calling Trump a threat to democracy, fascists, or worse.” Around the same time, former Attorney General Bill Barr said on Fox News: “The Democrats have to stop their grossly irresponsible talk about Trump being an existential threat to democracy. He is not.” There’s no shortage of relevant angles to this, but as the public discussion continues to unfold, let’s keep a few details in mind. First, at least at this point in the investigation, there is no evidence to suggest that the nature of the Democratic criticisms led to the attempt on the former president’s life. Second, if Republicans are convinced that this specific line of argument is beyond the pale, they might want to take it up with their presumptive presidential nominee. It was literally last week when Trump described the Biden administration as a “fascist government,” as his campaign operation issued a fundraising appeal asserting as fact that President Joe Biden is “a threat to democracy.” Two weeks earlier, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND EXISTENCE OF OUR COUNTRY ITSELF!!!” The hysterical missive dovetailed with months of rhetoric in which Trump has told voters the United States would likely cease to exist if he loses. As best as I can tell, not one of the Republicans demanding that Democrats abandon their talking point took issue with Trump’s rhetoric. Third, at least some of the GOP voices insisting that Democrats stop characterizing Trump as a threat to democracy appear to know better. In Barr’s case, for example, Trump pressed him to prosecute his political rivals before Election Day 2020, then pressed him to help overturn the results. The Republican lawyer also recently reflected on instances in which Trump, during his White House tenure, would sometimes “lose his temper” and talk about killing people who upset him. It is, in other words, odd to hear Barr claim that it’s wrong to see Trump as an opponent of democracy. Fourth, the former president’s allies are effectively demanding that their rivals stop repeating a claim that remains rooted in fact. As we’ve discussed, this is a candidate who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. All of which leads us to the apparent motivation for the GOP pushback: Republicans want to convince Democrats to stop repeating a politically potent truth ahead of the 2024 elections. That seems unlikely to happen."
"Judge Cannon sides with Trump, dismisses classified docs case",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 7:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-cannon-sides-trump-dismisses-classified-docs-case-rcna161882,"When Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices sided with Donald Trump in the immunity case two weeks ago, Justice Clarence Thomas took it upon himself to add a highly provocative concurring opinion. Special counsel Jack Smith’s office, the far-right jurist argued, is of dubious constitutional legitimacy. As NBC News reported late last week, the appointed prosecutor urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon not to take Thomas’ concurring opinion into consideration in the classified documents case. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained on Monday morning, the controversial Trump-appointed Florida judge did it anyway. As Trump confronts dozens of felony counts across multiple jurisdictions, the classified documents case stands out for a reason: It’s the toughest to defend. Last summer, even a Senate Republican was willing to concede that the case looked like a “slam dunk” for prosecutors. And yet, as things currently stand, the case is no more, despite the mountain of incriminating evidence. It’s important to emphasize that Cannon didn’t dismiss the case on the merits; this was done on procedural grounds. In other words, the judge didn’t say Trump is innocent; she said Smith’s appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional and therefore the prosecutor didn’t have the authority to file the case in the first place. By any fair measure, these developments aren’t just surprising, they’re also bizarre. As a New York Times report explained, “The ruling by Judge Cannon ... flew in the face of previous court decisions reaching back to the Watergate era that upheld the legality of the ways in which independent prosecutors have been named.” Noah Rosenblum, a professor at New York University’s School of Law, said he had been skeptical of the idea that Cannon was undermining the rule of law to protect Trump but added that his perspective has changed. “This is bonkers,” Rosenblum wrote online in response to the judge’s dismissal of the case. “She is just making things up.” Making matters even more dramatic is the recent pattern of events. A recent New York Times report noted: “Judge Cannon has exhibited hostility to prosecutors, handled pretrial motions slowly and indefinitely postponed the trial, declining to set a date for it to begin even though both the prosecution and the defense had told her they could be ready to start this summer.” She has also, incidentally, repeatedly given observers reason to question her competence, lent credence to questions that legal experts consider absurd, refused to assign pretrial motions to a more experienced magistrate judge for reasons that are difficult to defend, and justified procedural delays by pointing to logjams that she created. I’m reminded anew of an infamous quote attributed to Roy Cohn: “Don’t tell me what the law is, tell me who the judge is.” The special counsel’s office seems likely to appeal to the 11th Circuit, which has already reversed Cannon before in this case. University of Michigan law professor Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and an MSNBC legal analyst, wrote online Monday morning that Cannon’s latest move might actually be good for Smith, since the prosecutor can use these developments to ask the appeals court for the case “to be reassigned to a new judge.” Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Clarence Thomas gives Aileen Cannon more ammunition against Jack Smith,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 12:20 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 7:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/clarence-thomas-aileen-cannon-trump-jack-smith-rcna161172,"UPDATE (July 15, 2024, 10:18 a.m. ET): Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday dismissed the Justice Department's classified documents case against Donald Trump. While the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling is a gift to Donald Trump, it raises open questions like exactly which parts of the federal election interference case are immune from prosecution. But one thing is clear: Justice Clarence Thomas is questioning the validity of special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment in the first place. “I write separately to highlight another way in which this prosecution may violate our constitutional structure,” Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in the immunity case, Trump v. United States. “In this case, the Attorney General purported to appoint a private citizen as Special Counsel to prosecute a former President on behalf of the United States,” Thomas continued, adding that he’s “not sure that any office for the Special Counsel has been ‘established by Law,’ as the Constitution requires.” Even if the special counsel has a valid office, Thomas wrote, “questions remain as to whether the Attorney General filled that office in compliance with the Appointments Clause.” If the appointments clause sounds familiar, that may be because it was the basis for the unusual hearing recently held by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Trump’s other federal criminal case — the classified documents prosecution in Florida. One of the reasons that the hearing was unusual is that the legality of Smith’s appointment didn’t seem to be a close question. Now we know that at least one Supreme Court justice thinks it’s a question that may benefit Trump. Thomas had raised the issue during the oral argument in April as well. Trump’s lawyers seized on Thomas’ concurrence in a filing to Cannon after the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, writing that Thomas’ view “adds force” to their pending appointments clause motion, on which Cannon is yet to rule. To be sure, no other justice joined Thomas’ concurrence. But Smith’s appointment wasn’t the issue in the immunity case, so we don’t know how a majority of the court would rule if the issue were squarely presented. In the meantime, Thomas’ concurrence, in addition to the immunity ruling itself, presents Cannon with an additional opportunity to further complicate Trump’s prosecution.

Republican National Convention kicks off after Trump rally shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 6:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republican-national-convention-2024-trump-shooting-rcna161855,"The Republican National Convention is set to kick off Monday in Milwaukee amid apprehension over the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump this weekend. Long a formality, the four-day convention will be a subject of intense interest this year and has already been changed in light of the shooting at the Trump campaign rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday that injured the presumptive GOP nominee and left one attendee dead and two injured. Trump told the New York Post on Sunday that he is rewriting what was set to be ""an extremely tough speech"" about ""the corrupt, horrible administration"" of President Joe Biden in favor of a speech aimed at unifying the country. The schedule for Monday remains the same, however, with speakers who will argue that Trump's plans for broad tariffs and lower taxes will kickstart the economy. The official theme of the day is ""Make America Wealthy Again."" Trump is also expected to announce his running mate sometime this week, possibly as early as today. The shortlist of contenders reportedly includes Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Sen. JD Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. The pick will receive extra scrutiny due to the unsuccessful attempt on Trump's life. In an interview with ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show"" in mid-May, Trump said that the pick would be ""somebody that can ideally help you get the votes"" but that they also needed to be able to step in as commander in chief. ""You need somebody that can be good just in case — that horrible 'just in case,'"" he said. Trump is set to be formally nominated by the Republican delegates on Thursday, the last day of the convention. He is expected to deliver a speech that evening. In a statement Monday, U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle noted that the shooting had raised questions about security at the Republican convention and said that the agency had already ""implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday"" to provide additional protection. ""I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,"" she said. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
"After shooting, will guns still be allowed near the Republican convention?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 6:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shooting-will-guns-still-allowed-republican-convention-rcna161857,"Not surprisingly, those hoping to bring firearms into the Republican National Convention will be disappointed: Guns are strictly prohibited inside the Milwaukee venue. But what about the area outside the arena? The inner perimeter will have similar gun restrictions, though as my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted last month, “Open and concealed carry will be permitted up to within a few blocks of the event space, per Wisconsin state law.” In the wake of the attempted assassination targeting Donald Trump on Saturday, Wisconsin’s governor believes it’s time to change that policy. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: In theory, the Democratic governor’s request seems entirely sensible. In practice, it’s unlikely to go anywhere. As the local report added, “The power to ban firearms in the security ‘footprint’ outside the credentials-only ‘hard’ security zone seems to rest with the state, not the Secret Service, the RNC or the City of Milwaukee.” A New York Times report noted that some local officials tried to change the policy months ago — long before a gunman targeted the former president — pushing a city ordinance that would’ve banned firearms near the convention site. It failed. As the Times’ article noted, “The city is prevented from regulating firearms beyond state law, officials said.” What we’re left with is a situation in which the Secret Service doesn’t have the authority to expand the existing security footprint. The governor can’t do it, either. Neither can Republican National Committee organizers. Even local officials can’t act, despite wanting to. Under Wisconsin’s current state law, local communities can’t approve gun policies that go further than state law — and since state law allows open and concealed carry, Milwaukee’s hands are tied. Ideally, the Republicans’ gerrymandered majority in the state legislature could’ve taken steps along these lines, but there wasn't any such appetite among GOP lawmakers. That said, it’d be an overstatement to suggest that the area outside the venue will have zero restrictions. The Journal Sentinel reported in May: “Those looking to cross into the area immediately outside the Republican National Convention perimeter will likely have to leave behind non-plastic containers, tennis balls and other typically innocuous items. What won’t be prohibited: Guns.” Alderman Robert Bauman told the newspaper at the time, “I find that totally absurd. Literally, you can’t have tennis balls, but you can have an AR-15 assault rifle.”"
GOP lawmaker: Shooting means Trump ‘just won’ the election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 5:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-lawmaker-shooting-means-trump-just-won-2024-election-rcna161849,"The day after the assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, Sen. John Fetterman told CNN: “It’s shocking and it’s a dark day for our nation. ... I’m just so glad Donald Trump is going to be OK.” The Pennsylvania Democrat added, “This isn’t an opportunity for politics or strategy or how this is going to play out.” The senator’s comments seemed more than fair under the terrible circumstances, but it appears at least one House Republican couldn’t quite help himself. Politico reported: The Wisconsin congressman might very well be right. Trump was well positioned before his recent debate with President Joe Biden, and his odds of success improved after the incumbent’s poor performance. What’s more, the Republican National Convention is poised to get underway in Milwaukee, and it’s quite common for candidates to get a bump after accepting their party’s nomination. The combination of factors — Trump’s existing lead, the convention, public sympathy in the wake of the shooting, et al. — makes it very easy to believe that he will soon be in an even stronger electoral position in the near future. But recent history suggests some caution is in order. For one thing, there have been plenty of moments, especially in the Trump era, in which the conventional wisdom was shaped by “this changes everything” commentary, only to discover that the developments did very little to change public attitudes. To be sure, an attempted assassination might be a qualitatively different kind of incident — or it might not. Time will tell, and those making assumptions should probably approach the question with a bit more humility. There’s also some precedent to draw upon. The attempt on Trump’s life deserves to be condemned in the strongest possible terms, but it’s not the first time something like this has happened in the United States. In 1975, for example, would-be assassins targeted President Gerald Ford more than once, and he nevertheless lost his re-election bid a year later. Six years later, President Ronald Reagan was nearly killed, and while he saw a brief bump in the polls, it did not last. Perhaps most notably, in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt was mounting a comeback bid when he was shot in the chest before delivering a speech in Milwaukee. (The former president went ahead and delivered the speech before going to the hospital.) A month later, Roosevelt nevertheless fell far short in the multi-candidate race, winning just six states. The point is, we’ll be hearing plenty of predictions about the electoral impact of Saturday’s shooting, but they should be taken with a grain of salt."
Republicans scramble to point fingers after assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-vance-point-fingers-biden-assassination-attempt-rcna161841,"UPDATE (July 15, 2024, 3:33 p.m. ET): Former President Donald Trump on Monday announced Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate in the 2024 race. The morning after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump’s life, House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared on the “TODAY” show and echoed a familiar sentiment. Those in the political sphere, the Louisiana Republican said, need to “turn the rhetoric down.” Some in his party had already done so. Others had not. “Joe Biden sent the orders,” Rep. Mike Collins of Georgia wrote online. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida added, “They tried to impeach him. They are trying to imprison him. Now, they have tried to assassinate him.” Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania — who attended Saturday’s rally — initially described the assassination attempt as an “attack from the left,” though he later deleted the message. But it was an argument from a GOP vice presidential contender that stood out as especially notable. NBC News reported: “Today is not just some isolated incident,” Vance wrote. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” It’s worth emphasizing for context that the missive was published at 8:20 p.m. ET — barely two hours after the assassination attempt. In other words, as much of the country was still learning about the heinous act, Vance’s instinct was to blame his domestic political foes. Amid talk of “unity” and bipartisan condemnations of the shooting, the GOP senator wasted little time in blaming Biden and his campaign. Part of the problem with Vance’s assessment is that it’s rooted in a claim that’s plainly untrue: At no point has the incumbent Democratic president or anyone on his campaign team argued that Trump “must be stopped at all costs.” The list of contemporary American politicians who’ve dipped their toes in the waters of political violence is painfully long, but Biden’s name isn’t on it. But just as important was the fact that Vance, in the immediate aftermath of an attempted assassination, took on the role of partisan attack dog. David Axelrod, a veteran of Barack Obama’s team, argued online a day later, “If @JDVance1 is on the short list for VP, this Tweet, sent an hour after the assassination attempt in PA, ought to disqualify him in the eyes of the Trump campaign.” Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., was thinking along the same lines, writing that Vance’s rhetoric “should absolutely disqualify” him from vice presidential consideration. The public won’t have to wait too much longer to find out whether the former president agrees: The Republican National Convention begins Monday in Milwaukee, and Trump’s announcement about his new running mate is imminent. Watch this space."
"Trump safe after Pennsylvania rally shooting; gunman and a spectator dead, officials say",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:58 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 4:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-rally-injury-sounds-secret-service-rushed-off-stage-rcna161738,"Former President Donald Trump said a bullet grazed his ear in a shooting at his campaign rally in western Pennsylvania, where one rally attendee was killed and two other spectators were injured on Saturday. The shooter is dead and the scene has been contained, officials said. Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, is ""fine"" and received treatment at a local medical facility, according to his campaign. The FBI has identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. In a call with reporters on Sunday, an FBI official said the agency had not yet identified Crooks' underlying ideology or motive. The FBI is characterizing the shooting as an assassination attempt and is investigating it as domestic terrorism, the official said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro identified the deceased spectator as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, the former chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company, which is located roughly 15 miles southeast of where the shooting occurred. “Corey was a girl dad,"" Shapiro said at a press conference Sunday afternoon. ""Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community.” Comperatore's family described him as a hero who died protecting his family at the rally, Shapiro said. The two other spectators injured in the shooting are 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to state police. Both men are listed in stable condition. Shots rang out around 6 p.m. while Trump was speaking on stage Saturday at his rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, located roughly 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. Trump appeared to briefly cover his ear before ducking onto the ground with Secret Service agents. Screams were heard from the crowd as the “pop” sounds rang out. Secret Service agents then rushed Trump off the stage and into a car as he pumped his fist in the air. His ear appeared to be bleeding and there seemed to be blood strewn across his face. The suspected shooter had fired multiple shots at the stage “from an elevated position outside of the rally venue,” Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. Secret Service agents “neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,” Guglielmi said. Law enforcement officials found multiple suspicious canisters or containers in the suspect’s vehicle in the aftermath of the shooting, NBC News reported, citing two officials. It's unclear whether they were functional as incendiary or explosive devices. In a Truth Social post published about three hours after the shooting, Trump said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."" ""I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,"" he said. ""Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.” Trump posted to Truth Social again early Sunday morning, saying in part: ""In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win."" The shooter used a semiautomatic rifle, based on what was found at the scene, three senior U.S. law enforcement officials told NBC News. The FBI said Sunday that it believes Crooks' father purchased the weapon, but the agency is still investigating how the shooter obtained it. State records show Crooks was a registered Republican. Federal Election Commission donor data reportedly listed a Thomas Crooks of Pittsburgh as having donated $15 to Act Blue, a political action committee that backs Democrats, in 2021, according to NBC News. It was not clear if that was the same Crooks identified by authorities. As law enforcement officials investigate the possible motivation behind the attack, details about the shooter's life are beginning to emerge. A former classmate of the shooter told NBC News that Crooks was ""bullied almost every day"" in high school. ""He would sit alone at lunch. I mean he was just an outcast,"" the classmate said, adding: ""It's honestly kind of sad."" Crooks' family is cooperating with investigators, a senior law enforcement official directly briefed on the matter told NBC News. Biden forcefully condemned the assassination attempt and called for national unity during a primetime address Sunday from the White House's Oval Office. “I want to speak to you tonight about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics,” Biden said. “We must stand together.” He continued: “The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a would-be assassin. ... Let’s remember here in America our unity is the most elusive of our goals. Nothing is more important for us now than standing together. We can do this.” Biden quickly decried the violence in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Saturday, calling it “sick"" and calling on all Americans to condemn it. Biden and Trump spoke late Saturday night, the White House said. A White House official described the call as “good, short and respectful,"" reported NBC News. Biden said in a statement earlier Saturday that he was grateful to hear Trump is “safe and doing well.” Vice President Kamala Harris also said she was relieved that Trump was not seriously injured. “We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting,” she said in a statement. A doctor at the rally who identified himself as Joseph told NBC News that he witnessed a man getting shot in the back of the head and falling to the bottom of the bleachers. The man appeared to have been instantly killed, he said, adding that a woman nearby also appeared to have been shot in the arm. Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, said in a statement that Pennsylvania State Police are working with local and federal law enforcement. “Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable,” the Democratic governor said. “It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States.” Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said his office is “in contact with those coordinating security planning” for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which begins on Monday. In a joint statement hours after the shooting unfolded, Trump and the Republican National Committee said the convention would proceed. Violent threats against public officials in the U.S. have been on the rise. Many Democratic and Republican officials similarly issued statements condemning political violence as news about the incident spread. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on X that he is “horrified” by the incident and relieved that Trump is safe. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he is “praying for President Trump.” Several Republican lawmakers explicitly blamed Biden and Democrats for the shooting in statements on social media before law enforcement officials had publicly identified the shooter and his motivation."

And, the -- the bookseller kind of looks at the book and kind of looks at me, a big, bald white man, (LAUGHTER) and kind of says something like: “Oh, that’s a controversial book.” (LAUGHTER) And I quick -- “I’m a historian! This is -- interested. I’m not a Nazi. Please don’t — please don’t think that.” Maddow: This book that both John Jackson and Anthony Mostrom are describing here, this book they both happened upon in used bookshops, it’s a book called “Imperium.” And the content of that book is why a bookshop owner might shoot a sideways glance at somebody who was picking it up. Mostrom: It’s very much an antisemitic book. It’s very much a hate book. Maddow: “Imperium” was published in the late 1940s, but only barely. Its initial print run was maybe a couple hundred copies. And the author of the book, that was kind of hard to figure out. The book was published under a pseudonym. Mostrom: Ulick Varange. Ulick is a given Irish name and Varange refers to a nomadic tribe of Vikings who some historians say were the first to settle Russia. Maddow: Ulick, or “Yoo-lick,” Varange was listed as the author. But that was a false name. “Imperium” had to be released under a false name because the real author of the book, when he wrote this thing, he was on the run. Ulick Varange was the pseudonym of the American fascist Francis Parker Yockey. By the late 1940s, by the time he wrote this book, Yockey had been wanted for questioning about his relationship with a Nazi saboteur who was executed in the United States during World War II.  Reporter: They brought with them a great store of explosives with which to blow up factories and demoralize civilian life. Maddow: He had been linked to the German American Bund and to the Silver Shirts, the leadership of which had been charged with sedition during World War II. Yockey himself had gone AWOL from the U.S. Army. He’d been thrown out of the U.S. Army, which listed him as a Nazi sympathizer. And, after all that, astonishingly, he had been given a job as a U.S. government lawyer at the Nazi war crimes trials in Germany.  Reporter: Twenty-two Nazi war criminals went on trial at two minutes after 10 this morning. Maddow: Once there, he became a mole inside the prosecutions, using his position to surreptitiously help the Nazi defendants he was sent there to prosecute. Army counterintelligence files from the time say Yockey also was trying to recruit German Army officers, Nazi veterans, into an underground movement that would rise up against the Allied occupying forces in Germany. But when U.S. intelligence officials decided they wanted to go question him, he was gone. Mostrom: He’s being tracked by U.S. intelligence, yet he’s able somehow to fly out of Germany without any -- you know, no one stopping him. Maddow: Francis Yockey somehow slipped out of Germany ahead of the counterintelligence agents who were looking for him. He left behind his wife and his two young daughters.  Jackson: What do they call it in the spy shows? He goes to ground. Mostrom: Yockey is always slipping in and out, using false passports, false names, and just jumping from continent to continent. Maddow: Where Yockey first surfaces is way off the beaten path. Mostrom: He secured a room at a small inn on the Irish coast to write what would eventually become a 600-page book which was called “Imperium.” Maddow: Francis Yockey holed himself up inside that little cottage for months working on that book that you can still stumble across in a used book shop. You can get odd glances from the shop owner if you dare pick it up. You might also find one of the many newer editions and reprints of this book, or the French edition, or the Spanish edition, or the one in German. Mostrom: For a lot of people on the far right worldwide nowadays, the bible is “Imperium,” replacing “Mein Kampf.” Maddow: The book that Francis Yockey churned out inside that cottage on the Irish coast is a sprawling, unrelenting, 600-page long, super boring fascist battle cry. It’s basically an argument for the creation of a global fascist empire to finish what Hitler started. The book is actually dedicated to Hitler. Yockey calls him the hero of the Second World War. The book calls Jewish people culture distorters. It rants about the supposedly poisoned bloodstream and lost vitality of the West. It’s all the fault of the Jews and it’s the fault of democracy. Jackson: It is the duty of the West to rule the world, and that can only be accomplished through strong leadership, democracy is a sham, and the Jews are the great enemy and need to be dealt with. Maddow: Democracy is a sham and America is a lost cause. According to Yockey, America’s global influence was really just another way for the Jews to secretly control the world.  In “Imperium” and also in his later writings, what set Yockey’s Nazi claptrap apart from other more garden-variety Nazi claptrap is that while he was harshly critical of the U.S., Yockey said he admired Russia instead, not for its communism, but for its antisemitism, for the Stalinist show trials and purges and pogroms and murders of Jews.  He thought Russia had a pure and somehow primitive culture that was preferable to America’s modern, terrible multiracial democracy. And so, in Francis Yockey’s “Imperium,” Europe would finish the genocide of the Jews, and would have a fascist empire in cahoots with Russia against the Great Satan, which was the United States.  Down with NATO, up with Russia. That is what Francis Yockey cooked up while on the run from American authorities. Mostrom: The Yockey lore is that he wrote the book in six months, all 600 pages, without any notes, no books, no references. Jackson: They always talk about, oh, Yockey was such a genius that he sat in this little cottage in Ireland, just didn’t have any books to refer to, and just came -- and just knew all this stuff and wrote it up, you know, which is not the way you write a scholarly book, right? (LAUGHTER) Yeah, well, it’s easy. It’s easy. You don’t need a library of stuff if you’re just making it up. Maddow: Yockey’s manifesto would have decades of influence on the American right. It was also nonsense. It was just made up.  And it was also the American starting point for one of the most dangerous lies in human history. For people like Yockey, who wanted to revive Nazism who wanted to keep the fascist dream alive after World War II, explaining the monstrous body count from the Nazis’ time in power was a real challenge.  There were basically two paths you could choose. The first path, the most direct path, was to argue that the Holocaust was good, that it was somehow justified, that the Nazis had a right to do it.  That defense was tried at the war crimes trials. Prosecutor: During the first nine months of Ohlendorf’s year in command, this force destroyed more than 90,000 human beings, killed at an average rate of 340 per day. Maddow: The trial of this one particular Nazi commander is famous still to this day.  Mostrom: An S.S. commander named Otto Ohlendorf was responsible for the killing of about 90,000 Ukrainians during World War II. Maddow: This remains a notorious case even decades later, not only because of the huge number of victims attributed to this one Nazi S.S. commander, but also because of the defense that was mounted for him at trial.  His defense was that it wasn’t a crime to kill tens of thousands of civilians, it wasn’t even a bad thing, because the victims were Jews. S.S. death squads needed to kill every Jewish man, woman and child they could find because even Jewish babies were going to still grow up to be Jews, and Jews were inherently communists, and communism was an existential threat to Germany.  So, those civilian massacres, the defense argued, those massacres of tens of thousands of people, those were necessary, they were justified. This wasn’t just a defense of this one accused Nazi war criminal. This was an argument for Nazism, for the Holocaust, for what they did. American prosecutors at that trial, when they realized that was the defense they were up against, they were just shocked by it. Prosecutor: Some of these defendants still believe that what they did was not murder because the victims were Jews. No system of domestic or international penal law could possibly survive under which the determination of guilt for murder is governed by the political or religious creed or racial origin of the victim. Maddow: The lawyer who mounted that defense in that case, the ubiquitous Nazi defense lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer, he got help in preparing that defense. Mostrom: Yockey would surreptitiously send exculpatory documents to Ohlendorf’s defense lawyer behind the scenes. Maddow: American fascist Francis Yockey had used his position at the American war crimes trials in Germany to steal material to help in the notorious Ohlendorf defense. So, Yockey tried that path. He tried claiming the Nazis were right to do what they did. But he also tried the other path, the more insidious path, which was to deny that any of it happened.  Yockey wrote in “Imperium” that gas chambers -- quote -- “did not exist” and that thousands of people who had supposedly been killed weren’t killed at all, because they -- quote -- “published accounts of their experiences in these camps.”  Yockey’s book “Imperium” is considered by some scholars to be the first written instance, the earliest example of Holocaust denial by an American. Yockey was writing this just after World War II had ended, while the world was still absorbing the scale of the Nazis’ atrocities, the images of the concentration camps and the gas chambers.  This isn’t even history at that point. It’s current events.  There are myriad living survivors who escaped the horrors themselves, thousands of Allied troops who liberated the camps, who saw it all with their own eyes. Yockey himself had just come from the Nuremberg trials, which dealt with vast, vast quantities of evidence. Prosecutor: Deliberate, premeditated murder, murder on a gigantic scale, murder committed for the worst of all possible motives. Maddow: But Yockey would write that none of it had happened, that it was all a hoax.  And then he was on the move again. U.S. authorities tracked him to Italy, where he spoke at fascist meetings. They tracked him to England, where he gave speeches and did organizing for the British fascists led by Sir Oswald Mosley, who had been imprisoned during the war. Yockey helped form something called the European Liberation Front. Mostrom: Yockey wrote that the European Liberation Front was calling for the expulsion of all Jews and other parasitic aliens from the soil of Europe. Maddow: Advocating for expelling all Jewish people from Europe, writing America’s “Mein Kampf,” sowing the first American seeds of Holocaust denial, that’s what Francis Yockey was working on.  But Yockey would not just be a problem we created and then unleashed on the world, a rogue American fascist who we exported. He was about to become our problem, too, because he was about to come home to the America that he hated. He had friends here who wanted him to get to work here. And he did in what would turn out to be surprisingly high places. This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.”  Steven Ross: Democracy, he argued, is no good. His goal was to seize the American government  Sen. Joseph McCarthy: I’m completely dissatisfied with this whole investigation. Any man who can add two and two must be dissatisfied. Ross: He attracts all kinds of far-right people to his group  Sen. Herman Welker: One of the greatest living foes of communist slavery, that man is Joe McCarthy!  ******************************** Maddow: Episode 5: Coming Home. It was a big ad in The L.A. Times for a multi-day convention that was going to be held in downtown Los Angeles. Four days at the Embassy Auditorium. And there was a huge photo of the headline speaker for the event. It took up almost half the ad.  In the unlikely event that readers didn’t recognize his very famous face, there was his name right across the top in big letters: Gerald L.K. Smith. Gerald L.K. Smith: Preserve America as a Christian nation. Ross: Gerald L.K. Smith was a religious leader, a self-proclaimed religious leader who in many ways took over the mantle of antisemitism from Father Coughlin. Maddow: That’s historian and author Steven Ross. Before World War II, Gerald L.K. Smith headed up something called the America First Party. During the war, he ran for president on the America First Party platform, which included the sterilization and expulsion of all Jewish people from the United States. Gerald L.K. Smith: There is a highly-organized campaign to substitute Jewish tradition for Christian tradition. Maddow: After the war was over, Gerald L.K. Smith shifted from his America First Party to a new organization. He called it the Christian Nationalist Crusade. Ross: He attracts all kinds of people, all kinds of far-right people to his group. Their enemies are Jews and communists who are trying to take over America, and we loyal Christians are going to stop this effort to pervert our country. Maddow: It’s Los Angeles in the summer of 1950, and Gerald L.K. Smith is gearing up to treat his followers to four whole days of that. Mostrom: Some of the speakers included one of Smith’s loyal lieutenants. She spoke against what she called mongrelization of the white race in the United States. And this seems to have been the main theme of the conference, actually. Maddow: Journalist Anthony Mostrom again. Mostrom: It’s kind of hard to believe for us now, especially a native Angeleno like myself, to think that this was a well-attended convention of very far right-wing political speakers, but there they were. Maddow: There they were, packed into the Embassy Auditorium. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: Thousands of people. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: There was one speaker at the Embassy Auditorium for that event who was a surprise to the crowd. He hadn’t been listed on the program, but Gerald L.K. Smith got up himself and told the crowd who he was, and that he would be speaking.  He was a young man with an unusual name. He introduced him as Ulick Varange. It was Francis Yockey.  Mostrom: Yockey was the only one, to my knowledge, who was not mentioned in the programs at all, probably because of his outlaw status at this point. Maddow: Francis Yockey had come home, back to the United States. He was wanted by U.S. authorities, wanted for questioning. But, somehow, he slipped back into the country undetected. And once he was here, he linked up with the remnants of the America First movement. He started speaking at these Gerald L.K. Smith rallies across the country, in the Midwest, in Oklahoma, in California. FBI files record that these events featured calls to lock up President Harry Truman, lock him up for treason. One speaker claimed that he had inside information that one of Truman’s top White House advisers had been forced to change his name because he was secretly a pedophile. One speaker yelled to the crowd that the real Communist Party in this country is the Democratic Party. And then Francis Yockey, with a speech that would take the bark off a tree. Mostrom: The substance of Yockey’s oration was that the Nuremberg trials, which he had attended and which he worked as part of, that the Nuremberg trials were a sham and that thousands of what he called white Christian Germans had been convicted without trial, and that the Jews control the world today. Maddow: According to accounts from the time, Francis Yockey was the only speaker in Los Angeles to receive a full-on standing ovation from the crowd. Mostrom: Yockey would later boast to a friend that he delivered what he called a tremendous speech to this convention’s 3,000 attendees. Maddow: That is not a typical way to hide from the feds when you’re wanted for questioning. But there he is, after years on the run, back home, basking in the applause, somehow staying one step ahead of investigators.  Mostrom: J. Edgar Hoover was -- was being apprised of Yockey’s movements. There are thousands of documents that Hoover himself signed off on, telling various FBI offices across the country where there might have been a sighting of Yockey.  Maddow: While FBI files and newspaper archives trace the trail of Yockey’s 1950 speaking tour with Gerald L.K. Smith, the man whose speeches were the real hot ticket in American politics just then was a senator. Welker: One of the greatest living foes of communist slavery, that man is Joe McCarthy. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: In early 1950, Senator Joe McCarthy had delivered the speech that would make him a household name, his “I hold in my hand the list of known communists” speech. That speech was only a few months after his crusade to try to make the Malmedy massacre trial a scandal. Multiple reviews of the Malmedy case and a comprehensive, monthslong Senate investigation disproved the kinds of wild claims he was making. The Senate investigation even found that where those lies came from was from unrepentant Nazis who were trying to come back to power in Germany. But those conclusions, the actual truth of the matter, never got much traction in the press. The false allegations got headlines, the truth not so much.  “The New York Times” put on its front page the -- quote -- “storm of charges” about outright brutality by U.S. soldiers.  But then the determination that that storm of charges had been made up, and made up by Nazis, and made up specifically to hurt the United States, well, that didn’t make the front page, nor did the much more explosive story lurking there in plain sight, which was that senators like Joe McCarthy had uncritically stovepiped a false and dangerous Nazi propaganda operation right into the United States Senate and, well, right onto the front pages of “The New York Times.”  Reporter: The senators are probing reports that the Germans were beaten and starved to get confessions from them. Maddow: McCarthy’s lurid and outrageous lies had been comprehensively disproven. They’d even been exposed as a Nazi propaganda plot. But McCarthy never paid for that, because he was learning in real time that shocking lies will always get more and better press than the calm, rational debunking of those lies.  And if you are a talented and ambitious demagogue, that’s the kind of lesson you don’t forget. That’s more than a lesson. That’s a game plan. Reporter: Hearings on Senator McCarthy’s charges of communism in the State Department developed into a committee wrangle to find out whether McCarthy had in his files the name of the high official who allegedly covered up commies. Maddow: McCarthy’s shocking, confrontational claims about all the supposed communists he knew about in the government, those claims got a ton of press, just as his claims about Malmedy had got a ton of press. And, just like Malmedy, those claims would soon be the subject of a full-blown Senate investigation. Reporter: You believe, as of the moment, there are communists in the State Department?  McCarthy: Communists or worse. Reporter: Or what? McCarthy: Communists or worse. Reporter: Want to name a few? Maddow: When the Senate started its investigation into McCarthy’s claims about communists in the government, he did what he had done in the Malmedy case. He basically hijacked the investigation and turned it into a spectacle. Sen. Millard Tydings: Have you in your possession any memorandum, any affidavit, any paper, any photostat, or other material which would tell us who this individual is, not where you got it, not how you got it, not who gave it to you, but have you the material? McCarthy: All of the affidavits... Tydings: Oh. McCarthy: ... all of the photostats...  Tydings: Why don’t you say you haven’t got it or you have got it? McCarthy: All the affidavits, all the photostats are easily accessible to you. You can get them without any trouble at all. They’re all in those files. Maddow: Senator Millard Tydings led this investigation, and he and McCarthy wrangled for months. The investigation looked into all of McCarthy’s claims exhaustively. And, just like with the Malmedy case, this investigation also concluded that McCarthy basically didn’t know what he was talking about. But it wasn’t just that he was wrong. It was worse than that.  Tydings said that what McCarthy was pushing was not just false. It was pernicious. It was confusing and dividing the American public. Like the Malmedy investigation, though, this official debunking of his false claims, the spotlighting of what damage those false claims were doing, it didn’t make much of a splash.  What did make a splash had been McCarthy’s initial shocking charges, and also his new charge when the investigation was over, when McCarthy said it had all been rigged. McCarthy: I’m completely dissatisfied with this whole investigation. Any man who can add two and two must be dissatisfied. We’ve had the most fantastic exhibition I have ever seen put on by a Senate committee.  Maddow: To McCarthy’s growing legion of fans, this rejection of him by the Senate was a call to arms. There was a cover-up. The whole Senate was in on it. The whole government was in on it. Joe was the only one they could trust. And so, naturally, McCarthy’s next step was to set out to destroy the man who had dared to oppose him. He started implying that this longtime conservative Senator Millard Tydings was maybe himself a communist. He said Tydings was -- quote -- “suspiciously kind to traitors.”  Then it got worse. Tydings was up for reelection that year. McCarthy and his staff produced a fake photo that made it look like Tydings was secretly meeting with a leading communist. They distributed that fake photo all across Tydings’s home state. And after holding that seat for 24 years, Millard Tydings lost. He was defeated for reelection, because that’s what you got when you crossed Joe McCarthy. McCarthy: Little Millard is with us no longer.  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: “Little Millard is with us no longer.” This was his playbook. The insistent, dangerous lying, the no-holds-barred revenge on anyone who confronted him, also the belittling of his opponents, the name-calling.  And then there were the journalists who seemed to make McCarthy the most viscerally upset. Drew Pearson: This is Drew Pearson. I’ll be back in a minute with a prediction on Senator McCarthy and the latest inside news from Washington. Maddow: Columnist Drew Pearson had done as much as any national reporter to criticize Joe McCarthy. McCarthy’s attacks on Pearson included violence.  In 1950, at the Sulgrave Club in Washington, D.C., McCarthy physically attacked Pearson. He tried to beat him up. He kneed him in the groin. He hit him in the head. He had to be pulled off of him. The American Veterans Committee called for McCarthy to be impeached from the Senate for that. But Pearson wasn’t the only one. When columnist Joe Alsop criticized McCarthy, McCarthy started calling him not Alsop, but “Al-Slop.” McCarthy: I don’t care how high-pitched becomes the screaming and squealing of the left-wing element of press and radio. I don’t care what the -- what the Drew Pearsons, and the Mark Childs, and the “Al-Slops” and the Time magazines, I don’t -- I don’t care what they have to say. I don’t care how much they scream and squeal.  As long as I am in the Senate, and I hope that’s for some time yet, as long as I am in the Senate, this task is not going to become a dainty task. And if anyone wants to come in and remove them in some dainty fashion, they are welcome to it. But in the absence of that, if lumberjack tactics are the only kind of tactics that that crowd understands, then take my word for it, those are the kind of tactics we are going to use on them.  Maddow: With each of these public battles, up to and including the name-calling and the violence, McCarthy, of course, turned off Americans who were repulsed by that kind of politics, by that kind of man. But not everyone disapproved. Gerald L.K. Smith: The two greatest symbols in this civilization are the cross and the flag. Maddow: Senator McCarthy was not only building an increasingly large, increasingly fervent mainstream public following, he was also becoming a hero, sort of a North Star, to figures on the edge, like Gerald L.K. Smith. Smith: Fight mongrelization and all attempts being made to force the intermixture of the Black and white races. Maddow: In 1950, not long after his Francis Yockey, anti-mongrelization, anti-Nuremberg speaking tour, Gerald L.K. Smith actually did work with Joseph McCarthy in the U.S. Senate. Anchor: Anna Rosenberg presented a detailed account of the new defense setup to a Senate committee. Maddow: Anna Rosenberg was one of the most accomplished women to have ever served in American national security. Among other things, she devised the national manpower plan for America’s wartime military buildup for World War II.  When the U.S. government created a new award at the end of the war, the Medal of Freedom, the first American ever given that award was Anna Rosenberg for her wartime service. But then, after the war, Anna Rosenberg had the misfortune of getting nominated to a top Defense Department job just as Joe McCarthy was reaching the height of his powers. David Austin Walsh: She was nominated to a position in the Defense Department.  Maddow: That’s author and historian David Austin Walsh.  Anna Rosenberg’s Pentagon nomination at first sailed right through the Senate Armed Services Committee. But then there was a hitch in the process. Walsh: McCarthy went after her. Maddow: McCarthy teamed up with Gerald L.K. Smith to try to make the Anna Rosenberg nomination into another national scandal. He met with one of Smith’s top aides who was becoming well-known in his own right as a Holocaust denier. He said his stated mission in meeting with McCarthy was to -- quote -- “keep the Zionist Jew Anna Rosenberg” from becoming -- quote -- “dictator” of the Pentagon.  McCarthy and his allies turned on the spigots of conservative media against her, and they persuaded the Senate to reopen Rosenberg’s confirmation hearings, whereupon McCarthy produced a bombshell witness who swore that he had personally met Anna Rosenberg at a communist meeting in New York.  But it wasn’t true. None of it was true. McCarthy’s star witness had never met Anna Rosenberg, not at a communist meeting, not anywhere. Rosenberg told the Armed Services Committee -- quote -- “I would like to lay my hands on that man. It is inhuman what he has done to me in the past few days.”  Her outrage was shared by at least one of the senators on that committee: Lester Hunt of Wyoming. He told reporters: “I just hope that no Hollywood producer ever gets hold of the complete transcript of this thing. If it were put into a movie, it would do more than anything so far to discredit Congress.”  Senator Lester Hunt had seen Joe McCarthy’s tactics up close during the Malmedy hearings, and now here it was again. Senator Hunt’s personal files show him writing to a colleague about McCarthy’s attacks on Anna Rosenberg, saying: “That’s all it’s summed up to be. She happens to be Jewish.”  Hunt’s files also reveal stacks of vile letters he got from the public, letters smearing Anna Rosenberg, accusing her of disloyalty and worse, none of it true. These smears were being spread by known antisemitic agitators like Gerald L.K. Smith, and also now by Lester Hunt’s own Senate colleague, Joe McCarthy. Walsh: McCarthy was happy to go along with it. He would take information wherever he could find it. And if it meant working with far-right people with a specific agenda, then he would do that. Maddow: And once you start down that kind of a road, it can get real dark real fast. That’s next. ******************************** Maddow: It used to be called East River Drive because it ran up the edge of Manhattan right alongside the East River. But, in 1945, after the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, they renamed it in his honor. It would now be FDR Drive, which must have seriously annoyed Yorkville. Ross: Yorkville had been the heart of Nazi America before World War II. Maddow: That’s historian and professor Steven Ross. Ross: If you were a Jew living in the Yorkville area, you had to be very afraid for yourself. You had to be very afraid of what you would wear that was openly Jewish, whether it’s a yarmulke or whether it was a Star of David. Maddow: In Yorkville, right at the end of World War II, a new American pro-Nazi group opened its headquarters on the East Side of Manhattan right near the newly christened FDR Drive.  They were funded in large part by a wealthy German-American who had been interned during World War II as a Nazi supporter. After the war ended, he funded Nazi groups in Europe and in Latin America and also in Manhattan, in Yorkville, the home of the new National Renaissance Party. Ross: The very name National Renaissance Party was inspired by Hitler’s last political testament. Before his suicide, he wrote that he hoped for a radiant renaissance of Nazism throughout the world inspired by what he had done in Germany. Maddow: A radiant renaissance of Nazism.  Ross: James Madole, who was head of the National Renaissance Party, was trying to mobilize New Yorkers and a nation to understand the Jewish, Black threat to white superiority, white Anglo-Saxon superiority. And therefore, he was holding regular demonstrations on 88th Street and First Avenue in New York, the heart of Yorkville. Maddow: The idea behind the National Renaissance Party was not subtle. This was not a soft sell they were making. Ross: He told a crowd in Yorkville -- and I’ll quote him -- “I will plant the swastika in Washington.” And he promised the crowd -- quote -- “What Hitler accomplished in Europe, the National Renaissance Party shall yet accomplish in America.” Maddow: The National Renaissance Party’s stock-in-trade was to be as visible and as provocative as possible.  Ross: They would dress in Nazi uniforms. They would give the Nazi salute. They would actually engage from time to time in open violence with Jewish war veterans. When Madole would deny the Holocaust ever occurred, they would often try to break through the police barriers and attack him. Sometimes, the Nazis won. Sometimes, the Jewish war veterans won. But the Nazis always claimed victory. Maddow: Street violence was sort of the calling card of the National Renaissance Party. That’s what they wanted to be known for, for their physical menace on the streets.  But they were aiming at more than just hurting people physically. They were trying both to terrorize and to galvanize. They were trying to set something off. Ross: Democracy, he argued, is no good. He would create a fascist government in America that would educate the entire country into sort of we would now call white supremacy.  There would be a rebellion that Christians, loyal Christians, would join in, understanding that Jews and Blacks were perverting their nation, and they would create a new country, a new renaissance that would create an America that would realize Hitler’s dreams for the world. Only, it would start in the U.S. rather than Germany. Maddow: The National Renaissance Party was small, but they were growing.  Ross: He had chapters in Atlanta. He had chapters in Louisville. He was trying to open chapters in every city in America.  And many of those chapters were accumulating arms. His goal was to seize the American government, either preferably through an election and, if not through an election, through amassing so many troops that they would take over the American government.  Maddow: It was still happening.  During World War II, the leaders of American pro-fascist and pro-Nazi groups that had done stuff like this, they’d all been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in what was called the Great Sedition Trial. Now, after the war, the most famous of all the Great Sedition Trial defendants... Reporter: George Sylvester Viereck, the man who has been prominent for several years as a Nazi propagandist --  Maddow: ... he was working as an early adviser to the National Renaissance Party. George Sylvester Viereck had been indicted in the Great Sedition Trial. But in addition to that sedition indictment, he had also been indicted and tried and convicted and imprisoned as a Nazi agent for coordinating a multimillion-dollar German propaganda operation that covertly targeted the American public. When he had been a highly paid, highly-placed agent for the Hitler government, Viereck’s secret weapon had been his close ties with America First members of Congress, like Senator Ernest Lundeen of Minnesota, for whom Viereck wrote speeches, like Congressman Hamilton Fish of New York, whose office Viereck used as a clearinghouse for literally tons, millions of pieces of German government propaganda. But in the post-war era, for groups like the National Renaissance Party, Hamilton Fish, Ernest Lundeen, politicians like that were the old class, the previous generation. Who could these guys hope to work with now?  Here’s Steven Ross with producer Mike Yarvitz. Mike Yarvitz: Were there any particular elected politicians that they liked, that they were kind of drawn to, that the National Renaissance Party saw as singing a similar tune as them?  Ross: Saint Joe. Joseph McCarthy was the one politician that James Madole and many of the others rallied around, that they thought he was the only one speaking the truth. Maddow: Saint Joe, Joseph McCarthy, that’s who the National Renaissance Party believed was their guy. Ross: Madole found Joe McCarthy the only American politician really worth listening to and supporting. He spoke their language. He never tried to dissociate from far right groups that supported him. And they considered him as, they would say at meetings, Saint Joe, and he was a true American patriot. Maddow: They took the name for their group from Hitler’s last testament. They had designs on a fascist government in America, and they were quite open about that.  Their stock-in-trade, what they were known for, was beating up Jewish people in the streets. They were working with a notorious convicted Nazi agent. And they believed there was one politician out there who was truly speaking for them. Ross: When Madole would start his meetings by heiling Hitler and then heiling McCarthy, word of that got back to McCarthy. He never said boo. He wasn’t going to stop any group that supported him, even if they were heiling Hitler. Maddow: Now, you can’t control who likes you. And while they were heiling him along with Hitler, it’s not like Senator McCarthy was heiling the National Renaissance Party right back. But it wasn’t a total mystery why they liked him. And it wasn’t only because of his public image. In the early 1950s, Senator McCarthy tapped an employee at the Library of Congress to help him as a researcher. That researcher -- his name was Eustace Mullins -- was also a member of the National Renaissance Party. He would occasionally refer to himself as “Fuhrer Mullins.”  There was also the speech.  In 1952, Senator Joseph McCarthy was invited and he quickly accepted an invitation to speak at an event that was billed as an “American-German Friendship Rally.”  The event, naturally, was in Yorkville. The chairman of the rally was from the National Renaissance Party. The list of scheduled speakers included a who’s who of early Holocaust deniers and antisemitic and pro-Nazi authors and also sitting Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy then enlisted someone to write a speech for him for that event, a man who, by this point, needs no introduction: Mostrom: There’s no doubt that Francis Parker Yockey met Senator Joe McCarthy. Maddow: Francis Parker Yockey, that’s who McCarthy brought on board.  Here’s journalist Anthony Mostrom: Mostrom: Yockey was staying in Washington, D.C., and he met McCarthy through a lawyer friend. Maddow: Francis Yockey at this point is on the run from American authorities. He had been a mole inside the war crimes trials in Germany to help the Nazis there. He had founded a group pledging to cleanse the soil of Europe of all Jews.  He had pioneered American Holocaust denial. He had published his 600-page fascist manifesto that was considered to be America’s “Mein Kampf.” It advocated for the creation of a fascist empire and the destruction of the United States of America. So, obviously, in a career like that, the next step is U.S. Senate speechwriter? But that is who McCarthy enlisted to write this speech for him, this speech for Yorkville.  Mostrom: Yockey landed what you might call an unusual job. And that job was writing the speech for Senator Joe McCarthy at a German-American Friendship meeting in Yorkville, New York. Maddow: Yockey wrote to a friend about it at the time. He explained that a lawyer for one of The Chicago Tribune’s chain of conservative newspapers had made the arrangements.  Through that lawyer, an appointment had been -- quote -- “arranged for me with Senator McCarthy for Saturday night.” Yockey said -- quote -- “He wanted me to write a speech for him based on a whole batch, a huge corpus of material, to have it ready by Monday.”  Even Yockey himself couldn’t quite seem to believe it. He said -- quote -- “There are still several things to settle with him” -- quote -- “but it looks as though I have a job.”  And, apparently, he did. And one of the ways we know he did is because the FBI was on to it too. The FBI became aware of the speech. And in FBI records from the time, they take great pains trying to give Senator McCarthy the benefit of the doubt, to say that, based on some passages of the speech, it looked like maybe the senator himself wrote it, although maybe it was this guy Yockey. They really couldn’t be certain.  The FBI reports say that Yockey’s -- quote -- “location at the present time is unknown.” But given what they were learning about this relationship between a powerful U.S. senator and this Nazi guy who they were searching for, given all the information they then had, the FBI memo says that agents -- quote -- “may desire to contact Senator McCarthy” to learn more.  Yeah, maybe.  Mostrom: If any anti-McCarthy journalist had learned about this connection, I think Joe McCarthy’s career would have been severely damaged right then and there. But the fact is, no one found out. Maddow: Senator Joe McCarthy, by this point in 1952, was ascending to the heights of American politics. He was building a major popular following. He had the conservative press cheering his every move.  He was running roughshod over his political enemies, both in the Democratic Party and also his own party. He had pushed a Nazi propaganda hoax to the American people about Jews in the U.S. Army in the Malmedy case supposedly torturing Nazi soldiers. He was also pushing for individual convicted Nazis both here and overseas to be freed from prison.  After helping win parole for American fascist William Pelley, McCarthy also helped Senator William Langer campaign for clemency for Martin Sandberger, a Nazi S.S. commander who had been convicted and sentenced at Nuremberg. In Congress, McCarthy worked with some of the most fire-breathing antisemites and Holocaust deniers to make false accusations against a prominent Jewish U.S. government official. And now McCarthy was hiring an influential American fascist to speechwrite for him.  The speech was about how America had been too tough on Germany in the war. It was to be delivered by McCarthy at an event chaired by a National Renaissance Party guy, which is literally a group that dresses up like Storm Troopers. The speech Yockey wrote for McCarthy -- you can read it in the FBI files -- it ends with a rallying cry that -- quote -- “We shall sweep America clear of its inner enemies.” Senator Joseph McCarthy never did deliver that speech in Yorkville that Francis Yockey wrote for him. And that is because the press, a handful of journalists, got wind of McCarthy’s involvement in that rally and they started exposing who McCarthy was preparing to share the stage with. The journalists reported that one of the announced speakers had been linked to street violence there in Yorkville. Another of the speakers was becoming renowned as a Holocaust denier. Another speaker had been calling for the execution, the hanging of Dwight Eisenhower. Another was quoted saying: “Here in America, we hate the Jews and the Negroes.”  After that reporting, Senator McCarthy’s office discovered that, actually, he had a scheduling conflict he hadn’t noticed before. His name was already printed on the posters for the Yorkville event, but they sent late word that Senator McCarthy could no longer make it. Mostrom: There was such an outcry that the roster of speakers was stuffed with pro-Nazis that canny Joe McCarthy decided to bail out. Maddow: In the end, Senator Joe McCarthy narrowly avoided reading the words that had been written for him by the fugitive godfather of American Holocaust denial. And, ironically, he probably had the press to thank for that. But while McCarthy’s political star was rising at the same time as his radicalism, while the circle around him was getting weirder and wilder and more and more reckless, so were his tactics, so was his war with the press, and so was his war with his fellow senators. Pearson: That Senator McCarthy will have no more luck bulldozing his fellow senators than he had in silencing me. What he doesn’t like from his fellow senators now is anyone who opposes him or exposes him.  McDaniel: His bullying and his dishonesty and his brazen willingness to ruin the lives of people who got in his way was something that Lester Hunt had never encountered, probably could not have imagined, until his encounter with McCarthy. Maddow: McCarthy’s bullying, his total dislocation from the truth, his increasingly impassioned followers, who trusted no one but him, his willingness to introduce threats and violence into American politics, things like that tend to eventually reach the point of no return. McDaniel: He made the decision, this -- this would be the last day of his life. Maddow: That is next time on “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” “Ultra” is a production of MSNBC.

I despised him. And she did not.  I could not discuss him without getting into four-letter words, and I still can’t, because he was a -- the biggest liar in the history of the United States. I think that rings true. I can’t think of a bigger liar we’ve ever had. So, I loathed him. She did not. And I asked her, my sister Mary: “He said he had the names of 205 communists. Where did he get them?”  And she said: “He made it up.” And she knew. She was in his office with him."
