The underhanded fraud that helped create ‘N Sync and the Backstreet Boys,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 2:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-dirty-pop-documentary-lou-pearlman-nsync-backstreet-boys-rcna163507,"Netflix’s limited docuseries “Dirty Pop,” which debuted Wednesday, chronicles how Lou Pearlman, the man who put together the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, also put together one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history. Additionally, the Netflix series documents how the bands were started using dirty money — and how their success subsequently helped Pearlman build a house — really, an empire — of cards, through which he defrauded everyone from elderly couples investing their life savings to the Bank of America. Pearlman, who in 2008 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for a $300 million Ponzi and bank fraud scheme, died in prison in August 2016 at age 62. He had pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, money laundering and presenting or using a false claim in a bankruptcy proceeding. The docuseries is a compelling watch, especially for millennials like me whose glee at the never-before-seen footage of the boy bands will likely be followed by the crushing realization that we’re getting old. But it’s a very clever way into a story of financial crimes, which can run the risk of being dry and hard to follow.  “Dirty Pop” uses the rise of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync — including interviews with some of its members — to tell a captivating and complicated story of how Pearlman created decadeslong careers and irrevocably shaped the zeitgeist, as he ruined lives at the same time. More than anything, it probes the underbelly of unfettered late-stage capitalism, implicitly reminding its viewers that it's built on exploitation and preys on the most vulnerable. The docuseries paints the portrait of a man who seemed to have an uncanny talent for homing in on people who were vulnerable — and therefore ripe for exploitation — and could help him advance his fraudulence. The absurdity of it is itself a critique of the economic system Pearlman gamed. For instance, he started a blimp rental company, but, strangely, nearly every blimp crashed. “It was almost a joke … of people talking about how all the blimps crashed,” Melissa Moylan, Pearlman’s artist representative, says. In the series, Michael Johnson, a member of Natural, yet another boy band Pearlman started, describes the crashing blimps as an “insurance scheme” and said Pearlman used the insurance proceeds to bankroll the creation of Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.  As for his creation of those two boy bands, Pearlman famously told a writer for The New Yorker: “My feeling was, where there’s McDonald’s, there’s Burger King, and where there’s Coke there’s Pepsi, and where there’s Backstreet Boys there’s going to be someone else. Someone’s going to have it; why not us?” So instead of letting someone else create competition for Backstreet Boys, he created 'N Sync, his own Pepsi, himself. “Lou would always have people watch us perform,” Chris Kirkpatrick of 'N Sync says, “It was, ‘Oh, these are Lou’s friends. Gotta schmooze them up.’ I didn’t realize that they were all these investors.” And this was how the boy bands unwittingly became part of Pearlman’s game — he created the longest running Ponzi scheme in American history, which, according to the documentary, spanned more than 30 years. (That’s slightly longer than some reporting has indicated.) The bands’ success helped Pearlman create an image of himself as a music mogul, when, in fact, the opposite was true. He had reportedly struck a bad business deal with record label BMG in a moment of desperation, to get them to sign Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. It was a deal that supposedly left Pearlman with hardly any money — but he made up the difference by defrauding people. Over those 30 years, he stole hundreds of millions of dollars. And the absurdity intensifies over the course of the series. The meat of his Ponzi scheme came through an Employee Investment Savings Account, which was purportedly FDIC-insured and backed by AIG and Lloyd’s of London. He sold this under his company Trans Continental Airlines. Come to find out, he forged all the paperwork, from bank statements to FDIC documents — and that even a photo used in the brochure touting the success of Trans Continental Airlines, which featured one of its fine planes taking off, was actually a picture of a model plane being held up in front of a runway, the documentary depicts. The hand holding the model plane was cropped out.  The FBI raided Pearlman's home and offices in 2007, leading to his guilty plea and 25-year prison sentence — a length of time that was practically unheard of then for financial crimes.  The lives destroyed by Pearlman’s fraud offer their own kind of commentary on the tenuousness of capitalism. It is a system so unregulated and unfettered that it becomes a breeding ground for people like Pearlman and Bernie Madoff, ripe for exploitation. The lack of social safety nets and the desperation this creates reminds us of the extent to which capitalism strips us of our humanity. In the documentary, one retiree, whose life savings were lost after she and her husband invested $300,000 in Pearlman’s so-called Employee Investment Savings Account, tearfully looks at the camera and says that at the time that she’d rather not wake up the next day because she didn’t know where her next dollar will come from. The documentary also suggests that the death of Pearlman’s longtime friend and employee Frankie Vazquez Jr., who died by suicide in 2006, was linked to the devastation Vazquez experienced when he unearthed the truth. His own mother, a former school teacher, the documentary says, had invested in Pearlman.  The end of the docuseries is devoted to creating some kind of duality — Pearlman took so much away, but also gave so much, its interviewees suggest. But, as usual, it was the most vulnerable who lost the most. And that is to say nothing of the sense of personal devastation many of those who were close to him felt after they learned Pearlman was a con artist. “And it’s only now that I can look back at that, and [see] that’s the f---ing monster … That’s the monster that was my best friend,” says a tearful Johnson. An equally apt name for the series — and unfettered capitalism? “Quit Playing Games (With My Heart).”"

The ghost of Antonin Scalia might like a word with Trump on flag-burning,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-antonin-scalia-stupid-rcna163688,"Donald Trump told Fox News that “stupid people” would argue that punishing people for desecrating the American flag is unconstitutional. One notable figure who’d fail Trump’s constitutional test is Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice revered by conservatives whose seat Trump filled with his first high-court appointee, Neil Gorsuch. The subject came up in the context of people burning flags at protests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. Trump said on “Fox & Friends”: “I think you should get a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American flag. Now, people will say, ‘Oh, it’s unconstitutional.’ Those are stupid people.” (Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s poised to run against Trump in November’s presidential election, issued a statement condemning flag-burning, Hamas and antisemitism but didn’t call for jailing flag burners.) The Supreme Court addressed the issue in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. Liberal Justice William Brennan wrote the 5-4 majority opinion, joined by Scalia, that said: “After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest, Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in violation of Texas law. This case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent with the First Amendment. We hold that it is not.” And while Scalia would have disagreed with Trump’s legal judgment, the justice was a proto-Trumpian type who likely would have agreed with the former president’s instinct. Indeed, Scalia later said in public remarks that “If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag. But I am not king.” That was before the Supreme Court’s recent immunity ruling for Trump that did make presidents more like kings. But that doesn’t change the constitutionality of flag-burning — at least until the Supreme Court says so.

Biden's remarks showed he's a man of character. The same can't be said for Trump.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 2:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-speech-oval-office-address-nation-rcna163623,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 25 episode of ""Morning Joe."" ""Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from the modest beginnings of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States. But here I am."" Those were the words of Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday — the president of the United States.  There was no bitterness, no resentment, no self-pity in his voice, or in his presentation. His family sat to the left of the Resolute Desk, his wife and his children, as he gave that address – as he walked into history. History these days doesn’t move like a clock, it moves like a stopwatch, it’s so fast. The speed of history is frightening sometimes, and he is now part of history. Always will be.  He spoke with his family right there but part of it seemed to me that he was speaking to the American family, as well. During the speech, he asked the question: ""Does character in public life still matter?” Well, I would submit that it does. And I would submit that on Wednesday, you saw a portrait of character in the president of the United States.  Going forward, I think his place in history is well-sealed by his presidency, by the accomplishments of his presidency, and by his withdrawal from the presidency. You can only imagine how difficult it is for anyone to give up such power. We can’t really imagine it because we’ve never held power in our hands the way the president of the United States does.  We’ve seen what happens when a president misuses power. We’ve seen what happens when a sitting president refuses to cede power. And now, America has been given an object lesson in character and history by a man proclaiming: Here I am, Joe Biden, behind the Resolute Desk, ceding power."
A political violence scholar explains what's at stake after the Trump shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 1:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-shooter-rcna162412,"Pennsylvania man Thomas Crooks’ attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump on July 13 rattled the nation. The attempt on Trump’s life, and the shocking spectacle it generated, has raised fears about the increasing hostility in our political atmosphere, with violent rhetoric seeping into the mainstream. There are also questions of whether the act could inspire future copycats or aggressive counterprotests. In this particular instance, some of the long-term fallout of the shooting may hinge on the motive of the shooter, which investigators and authorities are still having enormous trouble identifying. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress on Wednesday that the bureau’s investigation has not “yielded significant clues.” Another factor in whether this fades or sticks as a momentous event is how different political movements and parties react to it. While President Joe Biden and Democrats uniformly condemned violence as unacceptable, a number of Republicans attributed Crooks’ act to Democratic rhetoric, despite not knowing what motivated Crooks and the fact that Democrats have not called for political violence. What remains to be seen is how people interpret it in the long term. To get a better understanding of what happened and how to think about it, I called up Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, whom I've interviewed before about America's growing problem with political violence. We discussed the possible motives behind the shooter’s actions, what makes political violence lead toward more large-scale conflict — like civil war — and how we as a society can turn the temperature down to prevent a spiral into chaos. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Zeeshan Aleem: It seems that investigators and reporters have had trouble so far identifying the ideology of the shooter. How should we think about how to interpret the event? Lilliana Mason: We don’t know what this guy was thinking. He could’ve been a school shooter type that’s sad and looking for attention. But it was political violence to the extent that it was violence at a political event targeting the leader of one of our two political parties. And so whether or not he meant it to be political violence, it’s going to be taken by people as political. One thing that I worried about immediately was whether it would be taken up — as JD Vance did — as “they did this to us.” I have a lot of research with my co-author Nathan Kalmoe showing that if you ask partisans — people who identify with one party or usually vote for it — whether political violence is OK, 10% to 20% say that it could be. But then if you ask them, “What if the other party is violent first, then would it be OK to use violence?” And then the numbers really skyrocket. In earlier data that we had from 2020, we saw them go up to around 40% of people saying it would be OK if the other side did it first. I was looking at data from June that we just got in, and actually on that one it was even more disturbing: It went up to basically 60% of people saying, “If they started it, then political violence would be OK.”  Could you expand on what a school shooter type means and how that might be significant? Mason: A “school shooter” can do violence anywhere. It’s horrible that we even have a word for this, right? It’s only in America that we have this word. This guy was very young. He was not even old enough to drink, and in the last election he was 16; this would have been his first election voting for president. It sounds like he was relatively isolated and troubled, and his politics were confusing. He was a registered Republican. [He also donated $15 to a Democratic organization via Act Blue.] We just don’t know. If there was an ideological reason, then it really fits firmly in the category of political violence that he wanted Trump to die because Trump was dangerous or because he didn’t like his platform. But if it’s more on the school shooter end of the spectrum, he may have targeted Trump because, for example, he wanted be famous, and was maybe already suicidal and this was his chosen way to go. The Reagan shooter was not ideological. It wasn’t because he hated Reagan necessarily. It was because he wanted Jodie Foster to pay attention to him. Some right-wingers claim that Trump’s shooting was an outcome of describing Trump as an existential threat to democracy. What’s your response? Mason: It’s possible that framing this as an existential election encourages violence in the sense that violence tends to emerge when we don’t believe that we have remedies within the system, right? That’s when we do protests; we engage in an anti-system way. But if we believe that we have remedies within the system, like voting, then we don’t need to engage in violence.  But what that ignores is that the Republican Party also thinks this is an existential election and that, if Biden wins, we will descend into socialism and communism and whatever else they think. It’s not being framed as an existential election just from the Democratic side. And the other thing is that Trump being the victim of this really overshadows the extent to which Trump himself has encouraged violence since the beginning of his 2016 campaign. He encourages it at his rallies — when people are violent on his behalf, he doesn’t condemn it. He didn’t ask the Jan. 6 people to stop until hours after they had already done all the damage they could do. He made fun of the violent attack on [former House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi’s husband. What does history and social science tell us about the possible repercussions of a presidential assassination attempt? In the 1960s there were a lot of assassinations and also assassination attempts. I think the 60s is a really good analogy to today in the sense of social upheaval, a lot of social progress, previously marginalized groups claiming their power back, and that was very disruptive for the traditional social hierarchy. The difference between the 60s and today is that the political parties didn’t take sides on that divide in the 60s. There were both more progressive and more conservative people in both the Democratic and the Republican parties, and so it didn’t pit the parties against each other on this really volatile topic. Now that we have Republicans as the party of “Let’s go back to the traditional hierarchy” and the Democrats as the party of “We still need to make more progress toward equality,” we’re going into the voting booth thinking about this. That means that the elections themselves and transitions of power feel more existential because they’re related to who belongs in America. It’s related to questions of like “which racial group is best” and “which religion is best” —  these are not things we’re supposed to bring into the voting booth. We’re supposed to find the people that represent our families, and bring us material well-being, and that our pocketbook likes, but instead, our politics are now arranged around who gets to live with the full dignity of being an American. We know that there’s political science that’s shown that in other countries, when politics is divided along racial or ethnic or religious lines, the chance of civil war increases 12 times, because those types of divides are uncompromisable. What’s the best way to turn down the temperature right now in terms of preventing escalatory spirals and worst-case scenarios? Mason: It requires all of the leaders on both sides to reject violence. One thing that my co-author Nathan and I found for our book was that it’s pretty easy to get people to back off of approving of political violence. You just have them read a quote from either Trump or Biden saying that’s not acceptable, that “we don’t do that in a democracy, and if you are going to engage in violence, I don’t want you on my team.” Reading two sentences from a leader in our survey experiment made people back off. It’s really important to note that leaders have a really powerful role to play. And we’ve heard that from Biden and from some Republicans, but we haven’t heard it from Trump or Vance. And so the problem is the people who need to be turning down the temperature are unwilling to turn down the temperature. They have the power to, but they’re not using it. I have seen some people sort of worrying about the possibility of mass violence or civil war. As a researcher on violence, how do you strike the balance between telling people to be concerned about things, but also not catastrophizing, since political violence is a reality across human history and doesn’t necessarily always slide into something like civil war?  Thank you for asking that. I think it’s really important to pay attention to political violence, but it’s also important to remember that it is still exceedingly rare. We have a lot of threats, but not as many actions. And the number of acts of political violence are very, very few. As long as that’s the case, it’s really important for Americans to do their part as citizens and not turn their back on democracy because they’re afraid. This shouldn’t be meant to scare people out of voting or going to their voting places, or even volunteering at their polling places, right? The people that run our elections are mainly volunteers. They are dedicated to democracy. They’re absolutely heroic and brave and they are committed. If people get afraid that everything is violent, then they might withdraw from participating and having their voices heard. And we don’t want that to happen. "
Michigan bans gay and trans 'panic' as a criminal defense,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 1:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/michigan-gay-trans-panic-defense-ban-whitmer-rcna163687,"Michigan became the 20th state on Tuesday to bar defendants from using a so-called gay or trans ""panic"" defense in court. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation, House Bill 4718, that bans the use of a victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity in defense arguments. Supporters of the bill have said that these defenses play into anti-gay and anti-trans biases and reinforce the belief that LGBTQ lives have less value. The bill passed the state House along party lines, but four Republicans in the state Senate voted with Democrats to green-light the bill. State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, who sponsored the bill, said in a statement through Whitmer's office on Tuesday that the legislation is ""a huge step toward securing a safe and inclusive state for all Michiganders."" The law goes into effect in October. According to a 2021 report from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, no state in the U.S. “recognizes the gay and trans panic defenses as free-standing defenses under their respective penal codes.” Rather, they have been used to support arguments of provocation, diminished capacity, insanity or self-defense. W. Carsten Andresen, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Edward’s University in Austin, wrote in 2020 that his early analysis determined that such defenses can reduce a defendant's murder charges about one-third of the time. Andresen told The Washington Post this week that he has found more than 700 instances of the defense being used in murder cases since 1970, including 18 in Michigan. The American Bar Association urged local and federal governments in 2013 to take legislative action to curtail gay and trans panic defenses. California became the first state to ban the practice in 2014 and dozens of states followed suit, but efforts to outlaw such defenses at the federal level have faced challenges, as The Appeal reported in 2021."
Republicans want to sow doubt about Kamala's Blackness. Here's why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-not-black-enough-propaganda-rcna163691,"Republicans can’t keep their bigoted stories straight on Kamala Harris’ Blackness. In recent days, several Republicans have attacked Harris as a “DEI hire,” suggesting her race (and potentially her gender) is the only reason she’s positioned to take over the Democratic nomination. Less prominent — but no less insidious — are the right-wing social media influencers and other anti-immigrant types who are fueling claims that Harris somehow isn’t Black enough.  Influencers like former Republican House candidate Laura Loomer and right-wing pundit Eric Erickson have sought to use Harris’ Indian and Jamaican heritage to suggest Harris — an HBCU-educated Black woman who’s been clear in identifying herself as such — isn’t actually a Black American or can’t relate to the so-called Black experience. Or take for example a particularly rich clip of right-wing commentator Nikki Stanzione telling Black voters “she’s not one of you” (forgive me if I don’t take Stanzione’s guidance on who is and isn’t Black). Similar claims are also being promoted by social media accounts linked to the ADOS movement, which purports to represent ""American Descendants of Slaves"" and which I’ve written about previously for its xenophobic rhetoric toward immigrants. This tired, ahistorical smear against Harris is designed to drive a wedge between Black people, and the social media campaign echoes one that was deployed against her in the lead-up to the 2020 election. The Wall Street Journal conducted a study in 2019 that found these claims about Harris not being Black were largely fueled by bot-like social media accounts and far-right influencers, from Donald Trump Jr. to the extremist activist Ali Alexander.  “Now, as in 2020, users frequently claim Harris isn’t Black enough or Indian enough to claim those identities,” disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz wrote for MSNBC this week. Jankowicz’s op-ed explores the racist, xenophobic and sexist propaganda targeting Harris in the context of the larger trend of attacks on women in politics, and it provides a noteworthy example of a Russia-based propagandist spreading a similar claim.  It’s important to see how these attacks align with the ways in which Donald Trump’s campaign and its allies have tried to win over Black voters: by suggesting they’re at odds or in competition with immigrants. This is the background for the widely denounced — and patently false — claim that Trump made during the first presidential debate that immigrants are taking “Black jobs.” Having extremely online trolls frame Harris as insufficiently Black, not Black at all or incapable of crafting pro-Black policies because of her immigrant background only serves Republican interests.  Keep this in mind as you scroll and post online."
JD Vance’s 'cat lady' video was the last straw for Jennifer Aniston. She's not alone.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT / Updated July 25, 2024, 12:44 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jennifer-aniston-jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless-cat-lady-rcna163674,"Jennifer Aniston, Kamala Harris and women across America are getting really sick of the GOP's bizarre, misogynistic insults. In the aftermath of President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the  2024 presidential race, Democrats have quickly united behind his vice president. In one day, Harris raised a record-breaking $81 million, and more than 28,000 people signed up to volunteer for her campaign. By Monday evening she had secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee.  Across the aisle, the Republican Party is scrambling to pivot a presidential campaign that was focused heavily on Biden and his age. Republican nominee Donald Trump (and his team) have spent a lot of time on social media platform Truth Social trying out numerous “names” for and various attacks against his likely opponent, including “Lying’ Kamala.” Conservatives have argued Harris’ laugh “turns off voters,” claimed “people don’t view her as Black,” thrown around labels like the “DEI” candidate, and  have threatened erroneous legal action to keep Harris off the November ballot.  But one of the more ridiculous attacks to emerge against Harris is the claim that she is not “fit” to lead the country because she’s not a biological mom. In a recently resurfaced clip of then-Senate candidate JD Vance speaking to Tucker Carlson in 2022, Trump’s newly minted 2024 running mate calls Harris a “childless cat lady” who, like other child-free women, ""are miserable at their own lives and the choices they have made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Vance also argued, as have other conservatives, that in order to have a vested interest in America and its future, you have to give birth — a stance that is equal parts insulting and hilariously false.  Vance’s comments have gone understandably viral, with Jennifer Aniston weighing in Wednesday on social media. “All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” she wrote on Instagram. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Aniston has had to deal throughout her entire career with speculation about why she does not have children. In 2022, the “Friends” icon told Allure that she had tried IVF, unsuccessfully. Vance voted against a Senate bill that would have protected IVF. Aniston’s response highlighted the hypocrisy of Vance’s comments. But they are also cruel. To be clear, Harris is herself the proud mom to two stepchildren — Ella and Cole Emhoff — and has been since she married their father, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, in 2014. Like the 4 in 10 Americans who have at least one step-relative in their family, Harris and her blended family know there are a myriad ways to create, and love, a family — a vaginal or C-section birth is not a requirement. Conservative pundit Will Chamberlain disagrees. “Really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn’t be President. No Children,” Chamberlain posted on X. “And no, becoming a step-parent to older teenagers doesn’t count. The concerns of parents and families will always be abstract to her.”  Chamberlain went on to say that he wants “a president with skin in the game, a stake in the future, and the lived experience of raising children.”  Chamberlain and Vance seem to be on the same page. “You have Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance said in his 2022 Carlson interview, ignoring the fact that, like Harris, Buttigieg has two children. “How does that make any sense when we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t have a direct stake in it?” Far-right political activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer — whom Trump has embraced — also made the same argument this week, while simultaneously accusing Harris of terminating past pregnancies (Harris has never said she had an abortion) and pushing the lie that having an abortion causes infertility (it does not, abortion is 14 times safer than childbirth).   Just like with small children throwing tantrums, I understand why some people may think it’s best just to ignore such baseless, asinine attacks. And yet we’ve all seen the damage that can be done when extreme rhetoric goes unchecked.  The truth is, fear and concern for the future is one of the many reasons why people are now deciding to prolong or avoid having children altogether. In 2023, 13 studies conducted between 2012 and 2022 involving over 10,000 participants in numerous countries, found that climate change concerns are associated with “less positive attitudes towards reproduction and a desire or intent for fewer children or none at all.” Meanwhile, child-free politicians are among the many leaders working hard to make the future better for the next generation of Americans. They have helped spearhead efforts to help reduce the maternal mortality crisis, expand the child tax credit and universal free lunch, and policies that protect immigrant families. Here’s another data point for Vance and co. In 2020, half of all eligible youth voted in the presidential election — an 11-point increase from the previous election in 2016. Did all of these young people have children? Certainly not. And yet they showed up to the polls. Because obviously, a lack of biological offspring does not determine your level of investment in America. Perhaps this logic makes sense for a political party that prioritizes vengeance, victimhood and selfishness over equality.   Or maybe this is just another example of Republicans grasping at straws after being out-politicked by an 81-year-old man who (eventually) put party, country and democracy over his ego.  Either way, we can be sure Harris will face an onslaught of racist and sexist attacks between now and November, all designed to undermine her as a person, a politician and a parent. But like so many of her fellow moms, the de facto Democratic nominee for president knows how to ignore these childlike tantrums — all the way to the White House. "
"In his attacks on the ‘childless’ left, JD Vance once hyped a plan to give parents more votes",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-parents-more-votes-childless-rcna163670,"A viral clip on social media shows Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, proposing that people with children be given more voting power than people without kids. On the heels of widespread denunciation of Vance’s past condemnation of Democratic leaders as “childless cat ladies,” the footage underscores the Ohio senator’s ire toward people without children. But there’s more to the story. The clip is from a 2021 speech that Vance gave to a conservative organization called the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. At one point, Vance offered up an unusual idea about voting: The reason I said there’s more to the story than Vance’s disdain for childless people is this proposal also epitomizes the Republican Party’s growing embrace of openly antidemocratic policies. As The Federalist noted at the time, Vance’s remarks — in which he also said that people without children have “no physical commitment to the future of this country” — came amid his praise for Hungary’s far-right authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán, who’s seen as a hero among Trumpian Republicans. In fact, as The Guardian noted back in 2011, Orbán’s Fidesz party proposed the controversial idea but the legislation didn’t pass. Per The Guardian: The Guardian notes that the proposal is known as “Demeny voting” because of demographer Paul Demeny, who popularized the idea in the 1980s. Demeny’s work is known for its obsessive focus on fertility rates and immigration and has been criticized by researchers, who have associated it with historical racist rhetoric aimed at curtailing immigration. If you read my Tuesday Tech Drop last week, you know promoting ideas from such figures is nothing new for Vance. So, yes, Vance’s remarks about voting put his cruelty toward childless people on display. But they also demonstrated his aversion to democracy — and his disturbing embrace of theories promoted by Orbán's far-right political party."
"Against election backdrop, economic growth exceeds expectations",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-backdrop-economic-growth-exceeds-expectations-rcna163704,"During the Republican National Convention last week, each night had its own theme, starting with “Make America Wealthy Again” on the party gathering’s first day. As it turns out, however, voters won’t have to put the White House in the GOP’s hands to achieve such a goal. NBC News reported: The latest data is roughly in line with the kind of quarterly GDP reports we saw across much of Donald Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency — when Republicans said Americans saw the greatest economy in the history of humanity. In fact, all of this comes against a backdrop of the 2024 election cycle, as the former president and his allies try to convince the public that the economy is dreadful, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, circling back to our coverage from a couple of weeks ago, there’s a lot for Americans to like about the current state of their economy. The job market remains strong, unemployment remains low and wages are up. And when it comes to inflation, the latest Consumer Price Index report showed price increases slowing sharply — including the first month-to-month decline in more than four years. What’s more, there’s an international context to consider. The World Bank last month not only noted that the Biden-era economy is the world’s strongest, it also concluded that the global economy is in better shape in large part because of the United States’ recovery. “Globally, overall things are better today than they were just four or five months ago,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. “A big part of this has to do with the resilience of the U.S. economy.” Gill’s report further credited “U.S. dynamism” with helping to stabilize economies abroad. A Washington Post report added, “The United States is the only advanced economy growing significantly faster than the bank anticipated at the start of the year.” Around the same time, The Atlantic’s Rogé Karma described the U.S. economy as “the envy of the world.” Four years ago, Trump told supporters that Democratic policies would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” Everything he said and predicted was wrong — and the former president hasn’t even tried to explain why his predictions were so hilariously misplaced."
The one Democratic criticism that seems to bother Trump the most,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 11:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-democratic-criticism-seems-bother-trump-rcna163685,"In the aftermath of the assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, many leading Republicans not only blamed Democrats, but GOP officials also pointed specifically to one Democratic talking point: Describing the former president as a threat to democracy, Republicans said, was simply beyond the pale. The GOP nominee is apparently thinking along the same lines. Politico reported: It might seem like a simple, albeit cheap, line at a campaign rally, but the closer one looks at the rhetoric, the more important it becomes. Right off the bat, Trump’s interest in “unity” has obviously been thrown out the window. Earlier this week, the former president said he was shot because “the Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me,” and as of Wednesday night, he tried to draw a direct connect between a Democratic talking point and the attempt on his life. It’s wildly irresponsible to talk this way — investigators still say they don’t know what motivated the shooter — but Trump clearly doesn’t care. What’s more, it’s tough to take the former president’s complaints about the rhetoric seriously, given his own record. In fact, the week before the shooting in Pennsylvania, Trump described the Biden administration as a “fascist government,” as his campaign operation issued a fundraising appeal asserting as fact that President Joe Biden is “a threat to democracy.” Two weeks earlier, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND EXISTENCE OF OUR COUNTRY ITSELF!!!” The hysterical missive dovetailed with months of rhetoric in which Trump has told voters that the United States would likely cease to exist if he loses. If he thinks it’s dangerous for Democrats to push such criticism, perhaps Trump can explain why he has pushed the same criticism. Complicating matters, the Republican candidate might not like the Democratic line, but it’s rooted in fact. As we’ve discussed, this is a White House hopeful who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. If Trump doesn’t want to be accused of threatening democracy, then he might want to try curtailing his threats to democracy. Finally, it’s hard not to wonder what Republicans’ internal polling has to say on this. The scope of the pushback against this specific talking point suggests it might be potent."
Melania Trump will tell her story in an upcoming memoir this fall,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-memoir-rcna163651,"Melania Trump, the inscrutable former first lady who has largely avoided the public eye after her husband's time in office, will tell her own story in a memoir set to be released in the fall. Titled “Melania,” the book will chart “a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence,” her office said in a statement Thursday. The book is currently available for preorder on her website for $40. Signed copies go for $75. A full-color collector’s edition with ""bonus photographs"" is priced at $150 and will come with an optional digital collectible. Trump’s office did not announce a release date. “Melania” is published by Skyhorse Publishing, which has released books from other MAGA world figures, including former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec. Melania Trump promoted her memoir on social media on Thursday, writing, ""May your experience reading my book be as enjoyable as the writing process was for me."" It will be the first memoir from the former first lady, who is intensely private. Her time as first lady was marked by a contentious relationship with the press and a discomfort with the confines of the role. She quickly receded from public life after leaving the White House in January 2021, and she has rarely been seen in public since. Her absence on the campaign trail as her husband vies for another term in office has sparked some speculation, and she forwent a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention earlier this month, bucking longstanding tradition. Coincidentally, Donald Trump also announced on Thursday that he is releasing a photo book — his third since leaving office — titled ""Save America,"" on Sept. 3. The book will feature ""iconic moments"" from his first term and lay out his vision for a second term, according to its publisher, Winning Team Publishing. The book is available for pre-order at $99, though signed copies are priced at an eye-popping $499."
Why it matters that Biden said he wants Supreme Court reform,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 11:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-supreme-court-reform-rcna163472,"The Supreme Court was on President Joe Biden’s mind Wednesday night as he delivered historic remarks from the Oval Office about his decision not to run for re-election. He mentioned the court among both his past accomplishments and in his vision for the future, citing his appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and telling the nation that he’s going to call for reforms.  Both the past and future aspects highlight the crucial role that the composition of the court plays in November’s presidential election — as it has in every election, whether people have realized it or not. Indeed, one of Donald Trump’s most lasting presidential legacies may be his appointment of three justices in a single term: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Unless a surprise vacancy arises before he leaves office, Biden will have appointed one justice: Jackson.  To be sure, the number of justices a president appoints can be more a matter of chance than skill, especially when it comes to variables like a justice’s health. That unpredictability alone underscores the importance of each election, as Republican appointees Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito are in their mid-70s and Democratic appointee Sonia Sotomayor is 70. It’s hard to imagine a Republican-appointed justice stepping down voluntarily during a Democratic administration, and vice versa. Of course, that political reality hasn’t played out equally across party lines, leading to today’s 6-3 Republican supermajority that has delivered significant wins for the Republican Party.  The gamesmanship inherent in the current process highlights the benefit of one of the Supreme Court reforms that Biden could adopt: term limits. Knowing how long a justice would serve ahead of time could remove some of the unnecessary chaos that governs the nation’s top court and, in turn, the nation. Alternatively, adding seats to the court could more immediately balance it out, but that doesn’t appear among the changes that Biden is reportedly considering (not that any reforms are likely to pass this Congress). There’s also the question of whether this Supreme Court would strike down reforms reportedly backed by Biden like term limits and an enforceable ethics code. Perhaps paradoxically, expanding the court is the most legally straightforward measure (it’s been done before throughout the court’s history), even if it’s politically the least likely.  At any rate, the dim prospects of any imminent reforms shouldn’t stop Biden from centering the court in the national conversation. Ultimately, whether one wants court reform or the appointment of favored justices in the meantime, the court — and the Congress involved in any reform legislation and the judicial appointments process — is on the ballot in November.

Why the DOJ’s handling of Roger Stone’s case got another look,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 9:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dojs-handling-roger-stones-case-got-another-look-rcna163662,"Donald Trump and his team tend to hold Justice Department officials in low regard, though it’s likely the Republican was pleased with the latest findings from the DOJ’s inspector general’s office. The Associated Press reported: It’s been several years since we last talked about this, so let’s revisit our earlier coverage and review.For most of the process, Stone’s prosecution seemed rather routine. The longtime Republican operative and close Trump associate was charged with multiple felonies, given a fair trial, convicted by a jury, and was prepared for sentencing. Federal prosecutors recommended a sentence that was in line with existing guidelines and made their case to a judge, in writing, defending their rationale. All of this unfolded exactly as it was supposed to. But after the then-president condemned the prosecutors’ filing via social media — a bizarre development in its own right — the Justice Department intervened and declared that it was withdrawing the recommended sentence. Soon after, four prosecutors announced their resignations. David Laufman, a former counterintelligence chief at the Justice Department, called the developments “shocking,” adding, “We are now truly at a break-glass-in-case-of-fire moment” for the DOJ. Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general, wrote in a message to career employees at the department, “This is not what you signed up for. The four prosecutors who bailed on the Stone case have shown the way.” Aaron Zelinsky, one of the four federal prosecutors who resigned, later told Congress, “I have never seen political influence play a role in prosecutorial decision making, with one exception: United States v. Roger Stone.” Zelinsky went on to allege that Trump’s Justice Department exerted political pressure on prosecutors to “water down and in some cases outright distort” the nature of Stone’s conduct. Given the seriousness of the allegations and the appearance of brazen political interference, the Justice Department’s inspector general’s office took a closer look. Four years later, it concluded that then-Attorney General Bill Barr and his team were involved in the case in “highly unusual” ways, but the findings nevertheless blamed the local U.S. Attorney’s Office and said it found no direct evidence of Trump asking Barr to intervene.There was, however, a highly relevant detail that might’ve been easy to miss, which Talking Points Memo highlighted: In other words, the Justice Department’s inspector general couldn’t prove political interference in the Stone case, but it also wasn’t able to ask questions of many of the key players. As for what happened after Stone was sentenced, Trump, four years ago this month, commuted his friend’s sentence late on a Friday afternoon, rewarding Stone for having lied on Trump’s behalf. The Washington Post’s editorial board called it at the time “one of the most nauseating instances of corrupt government favoritism the United States has ever seen.” The editorial board added, “If the country needed any more evidence, Friday confirmed that the greatest threat to the Republic is the president himself.” After Trump’s 2020 election defeat, he went further and pardoned Stone — two days before Christmas, when the developments were more likely to go overlooked.

"Eager for attention, Trump returns to a favorite topic: his legal cases",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-legal-cases-harris-rcna163607,"Up until Sunday afternoon, Donald Trump was about as buoyant as we’ve seen him over the last several years. After the Supreme Court and Florida federal judge Aileen Cannon handed him significant legal wins in rapid succession, he also survived an assassination attempt so brazen (and preventable) that scores of allies declared Trump had been touched by the divine — and then went on to bask in the adulation of the MAGA-faithful at the Republican National Convention last week.  But the more relaxed, subdued Trump disappeared almost as quickly as he came, as NBC News’s Vaughn Hillyard observed after watching Trump’s first, post-convention rally. And judging by his social media posts, one topic that has him especially exercised? His legal proceedings, three of which he mischaracterized in a series of Truth Social posts on Wednesday. First, Trump touted his “big win” in a “high Florida court” against ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos, which Trump claimed is a “powerful case” that will force the news media “to start telling the truth.” But Trump’s description of that development is misleading at best.  The ruling Trump was referencing came down Wednesday from a federal trial court — or, in other words, the lowest level of the federal court system — and merely determined that Trump’s defamation case against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, which stemmed from the latter’s March interview with GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, cannot be dismissed now, at the outset of the litigation. In his lawsuit, Trump claims that Stephanopoulos’ repeated statement that a judge and two juries held Trump liable for raping author E. Jean Carroll was both false and malicious. But in its effort to have the case thrown out, ABC argued that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over Carroll’s two trials, had already determined, in a written opinion, that the first jury “implicitly” found that Trump had “‘raped’ [Carroll], albeit digitally rather than with his penis,” and therefore, that Trump could not dispute that conclusion. In a July 2023 ruling, Kaplan determined that “[t]he finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’ Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.” ABC also argued that even if Kaplan had never made that ruling, his underlying reasoning was sound and should apply because Stephanopoulos’ descriptions of the jury’s verdict were “substantially true”— and therefore could not constitute defamation. (In delivering their verdict, the jury in the first Carroll case did not find Trump liable for rape, as that term is defined under New York law, and instead held him liable for sexual abuse.) Trump is right that Judge Cecilia Altonaga rejected both of those arguments, allowing the case to continue. But she also made plain that Trump’s purported “big win” was hardly the final word, explaining that she was “not reaching the merits of [Trump’s] claims. [ABC and Stephanopoulos] may very well convince a reasonable factfinder” — meaning a jury — “to follow Judge Kaplan’s reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos’s statements were not defamatory.” That, however, “is not the issue before the Court now,” Altonaga clarified. Within hours, Trump was crowing about yet another legal victory, albeit just as inaccurately. “I got out of my Documents case,” he posted, invoking the recently dismissed Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, “by WINNING against the FULL FORCE AND POWER of the U.S. Department of Justice.” Yet Cannon’s dismissal of that case rested solely on her determination that special counsel Jack Smith, who has not been subject to day-to-day supervision by the Justice Department, was appointed and funded in violation of certain provisions of the Constitution. Put another way, as MSNBC Legal Analyst Andrew Weissmann has noted, she dismissed the case because Smith — who was not confirmed by the Senate, as is required for “principal officers” of the executive branch — was functioning too independently of the attorney general and the DOJ. She didn't dismiss the case because Smith was backed by “the FULL FORCE AND POWER” of the DOJ, as Trump claimed, much less acting in concert with the department's leadership. But Trump’s third distortion of a judicial decision was Wednesday’s charm. For the first time, Trump — who complained constantly about the gag order in his New York criminal case during that trial — asserted that the order is now “interfering” with his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris and was engineered by Manhattan criminal court judge Juan Merchan “to benefit my Democrat Opponent.” (Harris, of course, wasn't yet running for president during the trial in April and May.) Trump failed to mention, however, that the gag order has never encompassed any statements about President Joe Biden, Harris or anyone in their administration. Instead, by its plain terms, it was entered to protect discrete and small groups of people key to the trial: known and foreseeable trial witnesses, jurors, lawyers and court personnel directly involved in the case, their family members, and finally, after a raft of threats, the families of both the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (but not the judge or Bragg themselves). Moreover, since late June, Trump has been relieved from the gag order’s provisions about trial jurors, whose names and addresses still may not be revealed, and witnesses, who can be discussed in any and all respects. It’s hard to see, therefore, how what remains of the gag order — namely, prohibitions on statements about the lawyers, courthouse staff, their families, and the families of the judge and DA — could impede Trump’s presidential campaign, much less constrain any core political speech. These distinctions, important as they are, will be lost on those who hang on Trump’s every word on Truth Social. But where it comes to legal proceedings, Trump has never played nice — and even a brush with death is unlikely to change that."
Beyoncé's 'Freedom' becomes the soundtrack to Kamala Harris' historic campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 9:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599,"In the days since Vice President Kamala Harris launched her bid for president, Beyoncé’s song “Freedom” has become the soundtrack to her campaign. Harris walked out to the song at her first visit to her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. It played the next day at her first campaign rally in Wisconsin. On Thursday, the campaign released its first ad, which again featured the song. The video contrasts Donald Trump's vision for the country with hers, with Harris saying in a voiceover: “There are some people who think that we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate. But us? We choose something different: We choose freedom.” Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which features rapper Kendrick Lamar, was released in 2016 as part of her visual album “Lemonade.” Rolling Stone called the song at the time “one of the most striking political statements” of Beyoncé’s career. Although the Grammy Award-winning artist has not officially endorsed any candidate in this year's race, she did grant Harris’ campaign permission to use the song through the next few months of the election, CNN reported on Monday. (That Harris is using the music with the artist's permission also stands in stark contrast to Trump, who's been asked not to play songs by the Rolling Stones, R.E.M., Prince, Neil Young, Rihanna, Guns N' Roses, Queen and Adele — among others.) Harris is a known Beyoncé fan. She and her husband, Doug Emhoff, went to the singer’s Renaissance World Tour concert in Maryland last August. The tickets, valued at $1,655.92, were a gift from Beyoncé, according to Harris’ financial disclosure report earlier this year. Beyoncé has a history of supporting Democratic candidates. She sang the National Anthem at President Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration and performed at a concert for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign alongside her husband, Jay-Z — much to Donald Trump's consternation, even years later. Beyoncé also endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020."

Why Trump wants his handpicked FBI director to ‘resign immediately’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 8:16 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-wants-fbi-director-resign-immediately-chris-wray-rcna163641,"Seven years ago next week, Christopher Wray, Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was sworn into office. After the 2020 elections, President Joe Biden had an opportunity to replace Wray with his own FBI director, but the Democrat said he was comfortable leaving Wray in place. But while FBI directors generally serve 10-year terms, Wray probably realizes by now that his future will be decided by the 2024 presidential race. The FBI chief testified yesterday before the House Judiciary Committee and offered new insights into the investigation of the recent assassination attempt targeting Trump. But as part of the hearing, Republicans pressed Wray on whether he’d seen a decline in Biden’s health. He said he had not. As NBC News reported, the comments were not well received by the former president who appointed him. In an online statement published to his social media platform, the Republican candidate specifically called on Wray to “resign immediately,” adding, “Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!” There is literally no evidence of Wray lying to Congress. But I’m also curious about whether the testimony related to Biden was the only thing that troubled the former president. During the same hearing, for example, Wray said there’s some uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Trump’s injury from the shooting in Pennsylvania. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” Wray told lawmakers, adding, “There’s a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.” This, coupled with the fact that the former president and his team have been reluctant to share even basic details about his medical care after the shooting, is generating new questions on Capitol Hill. For example, Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York — a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor — wrote online this morning, “We must see Donald Trump’s official medical records.” We probably haven’t heard the last of this."
It just got harder for Trump to distance himself from Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/just-got-harder-trump-distance-project-2025-election-2024-vance-rcna163631,"For months, Democrats have tried to let the public know about Project 2025, a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by the Heritage Foundation with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. Earlier this month, however, Democrats received some unexpected help — from the former president himself. A few weeks ago, the Republican nominee published an odd item to his social media platform claiming to “know nothing” about Project 2025. He went on to claim he has “no idea who is behind it,” he disagrees with some of its provisions, and he has “nothing to do with” the initiative. Democrats were delighted: Trump’s denial helped bring attention to the Project 2025 plan, which is exactly what the party was hoping for. The former president nevertheless issued a similar statement a week later, which again helped to push the radical blueprint into the national spotlight. At a rally in Michigan this past weekend, the GOP candidate not only tried to distance himself from Project 2025, he also described its authors as part of the “severe right,” adding that some of the agenda’s provisions are “seriously extreme.” Trump reiterated his position online again yesterday. All of this has the effect of alerting the public to the right-wing agenda’s existence — which again is what Democrats are hoping for — while simultaneously reminding voters that the Project 2025 is so extreme that even Trump doesn’t want to be associated with it. But there’s a related problem: The more Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025, the more we’re confronted with evidence pointing in the opposite direction. A Media Matters report explained: Well, that certainly won’t help. Complicating matters, a recent CNN report explained that “at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025 ... including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to ‘Mandate for Leadership,’ the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch.” What’s more, NBC News tracked down a 2022 speech in which Trump spoke at a Heritage Foundation event and said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” In case that weren’t quite enough, Media Matters also discovered that Paul Dans, a former Trump administration official and the director of Project 2025, told a right-wing podcast last year that his group has a “great” relationship with the former president and that “Trump’s very bought in with this.” I can appreciate why Trump doesn’t want to be associated with Project 2025 — most voters would find the agenda to be almost cartoonishly extreme — but his denials keep running up against reality.

"In ‘veepstakes’ process, Democrats appear to widen the aperture",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 6:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/veepstakes-process-democrats-appear-widen-aperture-rcna163616,"Ordinarily, a major party presidential campaign spends months scrutinizing potential running mates. Given the historically unusual circumstances surrounding President Joe Biden’s withdrawal, the compressed calendar and the Democratic Party’s looming virtual nominating process, Vice President Kamala Harris doesn’t have months. She has about a week. For the party’s likely nominee and her team, that’s the bad news. The good news is that Harris and her new political operation have an impressive short list that’s come together quickly. The New York Times reported: This list is nearly identical to the list NBC News reported earlier in the week, though NBC News’ version included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — who has said publicly that she’s not interested in national office, at least not this year — and the Times’ list includes Beshear. But let’s not brush past that “remains in flux” part. In fact, while it’s easy to believe Harris’ ultimate choice will be one of the aforementioned names, there’s evidence of a widening aperture. Take, for example, retired Adm. William McRaven, the former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, who is perhaps best known to Americans as the Navy SEAL who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. There were rumors a few days ago that McRaven — a fierce and eloquent Trump critic who endorsed Biden four years ago — would get running mate consideration, and that chatter was apparently true. “I am honored to have been considered as a possible running mate for Vice President Harris,” McRaven said in a statement last night. “However, there are far better candidates and I have removed my name from consideration.” Around the same time, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Harris’ campaign has reached out to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker “to gauge his interest” in possibly joining the 2024 ticket. CBS News ran a report of its own late yesterday, noting that there are “approximately a dozen” people being vetted as possible running mates. In addition to the names referenced above, the CBS News report also pointed to some Biden administration Cabinet officials — including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — who will receive a closer look. I won’t pretend to know who Harris is going to pick, but everyone I’ve spoken to in Democratic politics seemed to say roughly the same thing: They’re enjoying the “veepstakes” process enormously. “Everybody’s enjoying the moment and kind of thinking through scenarios and how exciting some of these combinations could be,” former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle told the Times. “It’s kind of fun.” Reiterating a point from earlier in the week, former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm are overseeing an intense vetting process, and I continue to feel sympathy for them. As a Politico report indicated, Harris appears likely to select her running mate “by the middle of next week.” Watch this space."
"Trump says Harris shouldn’t be ‘allowed to run,’ recycling weird claim",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-harris-shouldnt-allowed-run-recycling-weird-claim-rcna163593,"In his first rally since President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race, Donald Trump did exactly what everyone expected him to do: The Republican spent much of the event going after Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president’s case against his new rival, however, has tended to rely heavily on vague name-calling: Trump called the likely Democratic nominee a “lunatic,” for example. But during his pitch in North Carolina, one the GOP nominee’s lines of attack stood out: The Republican’s followers, naturally, cheered the rhetoric. There is a degree of irony to the comments: A jury recently found Trump guilty of nearly three dozen felonies. If Harris “shouldn’t even be allowed to run for president” because “she’s committing crimes,” then I supposed we should look forward to the former president delivering a withdrawal speech of his own. What’s more, insisting that the Democratic vice president is “committing crimes” would be less ridiculous if Trump had any evidence of Harris, you know, actually committing crimes. But of particular interest was the GOP candidate’s suggestion that his likely Democratic rival “shouldn’t even be allowed to run” for the White House. If the comment rang a bell, there’s a good reason for that: Part of the problem here is that the Republican nominee is getting lazy, recycling stale insults, nicknames and attacks. But just as notable is the fact that Trump has long taken a keen interest in who should and shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him, and in a remarkable coincidence, he consistently argues that those who stand in his way are — or should be — ineligible for American ballots. Trump already earned a reputation as someone who was hostile toward democracy. This won’t help. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why Democrats may need Mark Kelly to stay in Arizona,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-mark-kelly-vp-arizona-rcna163454,"Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., is a lot of great things. He is an astronaut and a Navy combat pilot. His parents were police officers, and his wife, Gabby Giffords, was a congresswoman severely injured by a mass shooter. Kelly is a gun owner and Second Amendment supporter who has long campaigned for reasonable gun control. He is a Democrat who somehow won not one but two statewide races for U.S. Senate in 2020 and 2022 in Arizona, where — until Kyrsten Sinema in 2018 — no Democrat had held a Senate seat for 30 years.  His résumé is impeccable, and he is likable. That’s why Kelly is now among the front-runners to be selected by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate. But picking Kelly as her vice presidential running mate would be a mistake. Kelly does not bring fire to the campaign trail. He would not fill the “attack dog” position the VP candidate traditionally holds. Kelly barely speaks to the media or the people. He is successful by being middle of the road and quiet — which is perfect for a Democrat in Arizona but not for the Democratic VP candidate campaigning around the U.S. Kelly’s political success is based on a now-proven playbook for Democrats in Arizona. Run to the center, appeal to independents (approximately one-third of Arizona voters) and moderates, debate as infrequently as possible, limit public speaking, keep a low profile with the media, raise money and run ads. Kelly follows this playbook perfectly, and it has worked well for him. But it would not work for him as the VP candidate. For all of his credibility, experience and substance, Kelly lacks the political charisma and fire necessary to run for national office. Even his biggest supporters acknowledge privately that Kelly is not a great orator or debater. No one attends a Mark Kelly speech or event and walks away talking about his passion or persuasiveness.  He is extremely accomplished, a proven leader able to handle the intense stress of combat and commanding two space flights. He probably would be a solid vice president, but he would not help Kamala Harris win the presidency. Harris needs a partner in this race who can bring people to their feet. Who can excite Democrats around the country. Who can publicly push back with power and clarity when Donald Trump or JD Vance make outlandish claims — or outright lie. Kelly is not that guy.  There are barely more than 100 days to the election and a lot to overcome. This fight requires two strong retail politicians. Kelly’s political skills are moderation and discipline, but those skills are not what is needed in a fast-paced national campaign against Trump’s lies, attacks and threats. Can Kelly transform himself into an aggressive politician? Perhaps he has suppressed that part of him in his two Senate races. Maybe he could, indeed, be the political attack dog needed at this moment. He is a combat pilot, after all.  But at what cost? Kelly brings substance and the ability to work across the aisle, but he would endanger the credibility and reputation he has built in Arizona as a moderate centrist Democrat that paves his way to Senate wins. And he would put his next Senate election at risk if a Harris-Kelly ticket loses.  If they do win the White House, Arizona loses a proven Democratic winner important to Senate balance with no guarantee of holding the seat. Winning would allow Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs to appoint his replacement in 2025, but a new election would be held in 2026 (rather than 2028) — with no guarantee that Kelly’s successor would enjoy the same support among independents and even moderate Republicans necessary to win in Arizona. There are other great options for a running mate, including several governors who are great orators comfortable with political sparring, without the threat of giving up a Democratic-held seat in a swing state.  Mark Kelly is a great man and a great senator, but he is not the person for this moment. A fast, grueling campaign against Trump and Vance requires a different set of skills. Harris would be well served by looking elsewhere. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here and the case for Josh Shapiro here."
Trump voters fear 'excitement' of Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/wisconsin-voters-swing-state-trump-harris-2024-rcna163528,"On Tuesday, Elise Jordan, an MSNBC political analyst and former George W. Bush administration staffer, sat down with voters in the battleground state of Wisconsin. The Badger State has played a pivotal role in deciding the last two presidential elections. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, defeating Hillary Clinton by almost 23,000 votes. In 2020, Joe Biden turned the state back to blue, beating Trump by a similar margin. Ahead of the 2024 election, Jordan spoke with two voting blocs that could help move the margin in either candidate's direction: female Trump supporters and right-leaning swing voters. Jordan, who was just in Wisconsin last month conducting similar focus groups, said she was shocked at the burst of energy Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy had injected into the race — among both Trump supporters and swing voters. The group of Trump supporters told Jordan they feared the Democratic ticket shake-up could lower Trump’s chances of retaking the White House, since they believe Harris could motivate young, minority and female voters to head to the polls. “Everyone is excited about her, and that scares me,"" one voter shared. Asked how they view Harris’ competence and experience compared to Biden, voters said they saw the vice president as worse. One woman called out Harris for her role in the administration's immigration policy: ""She doesn't even know what's going on at the border, and that's what she was supposed to be in charge of? I mean, as a schoolteacher, if I didn't do what I was supposed to be doing, you better believe my job would be in jeopardy."" Another voter took aim at Harris' intelligence, calling her an ""idiot"" and ""not real smart."" The voters also expressed doubt over the possible election outcome. Asked whether a Harris victory in November would be an ""honest result,"" the entire group shook their heads at Jordan. As for right-leaning swing voters, the group said they had concerns about both Harris and Trump. One voter told Jordan she was open to voting for Harris but felt ""uneasy"" over how much the vice president may have known about Biden's mental and physical fitness. She said if Harris was ""willing to hide that type of information"" about Biden, ""what she’s willing to hide for herself?” As for their views of the former president, a voter told Jordan she couldn't ignore Trump's criminal convictions. She also had issues with his integrity and moral character, suggesting Trump could use the office to ""retaliate"" against his enemies. Another voter voiced shared concern over Trump’s “making too aggressive of choices” and acting out of impulse. However, she also worried Harris could be too cautious in responding to threats and make the U.S. appear ""weak."" One swing voter had a message for both candidates: “It would just be nice if they concentrate more on the issues instead of the mudslinging and personal attacks. ... Let’s try to find that common ground where we can agree on things. Let’s start with that.”"
Someone needs to teach Tom Cotton and the GOP what the word ‘coup’ really means,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/maga-republicans-joe-biden-coup-divide-democrats-rcna163434,"Almost four years after supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 election, Republicans have finally become comfortable using the word “coup.” However, consistent with their upside-down view of the world, Republicans are not using “coup” to characterize what Trump and his supporters attempted between his losing the election and Jan. 6, 2021. They’re using it to mischaracterize Democrats convincing President Joe Biden to step aside to give Democrats a stronger chance of defeating Trump. Shortly after the news broke Sunday that Biden was dropping out of his presidential campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democrats’ nominee, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X, “Joe Biden succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors, ignoring millions of Democratic primary votes.” “The coup is complete,” wrote MAGA Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., also echoed the claim that we witnessed a “coup” when Biden dropped out. “Is it a coup against Joe Biden?” Fox News host Jesse Watters asked Trump and his running mate JD Vance in an interview that aired Monday morning. Vance responded point blank, “Yeah, I think it is.” Trump though was uncharacteristically sheepish, only telling Watters, “Sort of.” Biden dropped out for the same reason politicians have ended their campaigns since time immemorial: He realized he couldn’t win. As NBC News reported Sunday, Biden decided to end his campaign after discussing his election prospects with his wife, family and key advisers. It’s true Biden wasn’t happy with the growing calls for him to drop out after his deeply troubling debate performance against Trump in June. However, as NBC News noted, Biden reached his decision after reviewing extensive polling data, including data showing how Vice President Kamala Harris would fare in a potential matchup against Trump. At the end of it all, as the NBC News report puts it, “Biden came grudgingly to accept that he could not sustain his campaign with poll numbers slipping, donors fleeing and party luminaries pushing him to exit.” “While it has been my intention to seek reelection,” Biden said in a letter to the nation Sunday afternoon, “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” That’s not a coup. That's what American politics has long looked like. True, a president dropping out only a little more than 100 days from the election was jarring and historic. But at the end, Biden made what he believed was the best choice for himself, his family, his party and his country. In contrast, Trump didn’t bow out even after he lost the 2020 election. Unlike Biden, who accepted that he couldn’t win, Trump wouldn’t even accept that he didn’t win. As the federal indictment against Trump charging him with four felonies puts it, “Despite having lost, the Defendant was determined to remain in power.” To that end, according to the indictment, Trump “pursued unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results.” That’s what Republicans ought to be calling a “coup.” Trump’s “criminal scheme,” as the indictment describes it, included replacing legally elected electors to the Electoral College with fake ones chosen by his campaign to deliver Trump the victory he didn’t actually win. And it included an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. That’s what an attempted coup attempt looks like, not anxious Democrats pressing Biden to drop out. In fact, when challenged, Republicans can’t even defend their use of the word “coup” to describe what Democrats did. “So why call this a coup and not Jan. 6?” CNN anchor John Berman asked Cotton. The senator gave a meandering answer that included, “George Clooney, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street bankers all working behind closed doors to bring unbearable pressure to bear on Joe Biden.” Berman wouldn’t let the issue go. “You use the language ‘coup,’ and again, you’ve never said that for Jan. 6.” He said, “As far as I know, no cops were beaten up. No one defecated in the Capitol. There was no criminal trespass in terms of changing the Democratic candidates, were there?” Cotton evaded the question and instead began spouting comments about Harris’ record when she was a district attorney nearly two decades ago. This coup claim is just as baseless and hypocritical as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., claiming that, by Biden dropping out, he is  “invalidating votes” of millions of Democrats who cast a ballot for him in the primary elections. Johnson professing to care about Democratic voters is laughable. He played a visible role in trying to help Trump convince the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out the votes of millions of people who voted for Biden in the 2020 general election. By characterizing the Democrats' changing of the guard as a coup, the GOP’s goal was apparently to divide Democrats with a narrative that Biden was unjustly forced out. As the off-the-charts excitement and enthusiasm for Harris confirms, that’s not working. But using the word could definitely work for Democrats. They shouldn’t let voters forget that Republicans have nominated for president a man who fought against leaving when voters told him to. That attempted coup should alarm all Americans who treasure our democratic republic."
Biden should have given this speech a year ago,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 7:23 PM PDT / Updated July 24, 2024, 7:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-prime-time-speech-wednesday-rcna163345,"This is the speech President Joe Biden should have given a year ago. In a barely 10-minute address to the nation from behind the Resolute Desk on Wednesday night, Biden put a bow on his decision to abandon his cratering re-election campaign. Biden, still recovering from Covid, spoke haltingly and at times seemed to slur his words — sometimes repeating sentences with the words rearranged a bit. Even when he was boasting of his administration’s accomplishments, there was a mournful tenor in his voice. He looked exposed.  But his appeals for unity amid ongoing attacks on our democracy didn’t ring hollow. He came off like a patriotic American who saw his predecessor unforgivably botch the early days of a pandemic and then try to overturn the results of a free and fair election. Biden, for all his baggage, understands the dangers on the horizon.  Yes, he’s a career politician who ran for president three times. He’s always wanted this job and never wanted to give it up. But sitting in the Oval Office, surrounded by family and staff members, Biden didn’t look like a man defeated by an uprising within his own party. He looked like a man who finally accepted reality and who needs some rest.  This is the correct outcome. And yet, when he recalled his promise to the American people to “always level with you … to tell the truth,” I couldn’t help but feel a bit gaslighted. After what would prove to be a career-ending debate performance in June, it seemed that only Biden’s inner circle failed to understand there was no going back. There was no way to convincingly argue that Biden hadn’t lost a step — or many steps — and that he’d be just fine if he served another four years.  Biden was never supposed to be an eight-year president. He was always supposed to be a “bridge” to the next generation. Though he never pledged to do it, during the 2020 election there were breadcrumbs of reporting in The New York Times and Politico that indicated Biden and top advisers were at least open to the idea of his serving just one term, then riding off into the sunset as the hero who dislodged Trump from the White House and leaving it to someone else to take the helm in four years. If Biden had given this speech a year ago — telling members of his own party to vote for someone else and thanking Americans for their faith in him — he’d have done far less damage to his administration’s credibility, and he would have enabled a competitive primary process.   He didn’t, so instead we’ve got a just-over-100-day presidential election the likes of which we’ve never seen before.  It’d be a stretch to use President Gerald Ford’s famous post-Watergate line, “Our long national nightmare is over,” but the specter of an ailing, unpopular 81-year-old president trying to persuade the country — again — to vote for him instead of Trump was kind of a nightmare for a lot of Americans. And now it is in fact over.  We’re at that bridge to the future now. Look at the other ticket, featuring a 78-year-old former president and a 39-year-old senator with less than two years of experience in office. Trump’s decision to pick Sen. JD Vance is MAGA’s passing of the torch. And if they win on Election Day, this country could be forever changed in a terrible way.  We can’t know yet what will happen in November. But a few weeks ago, Biden seemed almost certainly on a path to a crushing defeat. Instead, his early exit means there is now a much better chance that his work can and will be continued — and his legacy not destroyed."
