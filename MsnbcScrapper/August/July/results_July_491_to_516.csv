Hunter Biden accuses Fox News of distributing 'revenge porn' of him in mock trial miniseries,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 11:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hunter-biden-fox-news-revenge-porn-lawsuit-rcna160006,"Hunter Biden has filed a lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the network of distributing “revenge porn” in its miniseries of a mock trial over imaginary criminal charges against him. Filed in New York state court on Sunday, the lawsuit accuses the network of engaging in “unlawful commercial exploitation of Mr. Biden’s image, name, and likeness” in its six-part miniseries, “The Trial of Hunter Biden.” Although the series is fictional, it points to real stills and videos that show the president's son unclothed, with his intimate parts exposed and engaging in sex acts. “Fox published and disseminated these intimate images to its vast audience of millions as part of an entertainment program in order to humiliate, harass, annoy, and alarm Mr. Biden and to tarnish his reputation,” the complaint states. Fox News called Biden’s lawsuit “politically motivated” and “devoid of merit.” “Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon,” a network spokesperson said. “Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden’s own making, and we look forward to vindicating our rights in court.” Biden last month was convicted on federal charges of lying to obtain a firearm, which he is appealing. He is also set to stand trial in a federal tax case in September. But the Fox News series, released on its streaming service in October 2022, is centered on a mock trial over hypothetical charges of illegal foreign lobbying and bribery against the president's son, crimes he has never been charged with. Biden threatened to sue the network in April, prompting Fox News to quickly remove the series from its platforms. Months later, Biden has made good on his threat. The lawsuit alleges that Fox News' publication of his nude images violates New York's statute on the distribution of intimate photos of a person without their consent. It also seeks damages from Fox News — which already reached a $787 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems last April and is battling it out in court with Smartmatic in a separate defamation lawsuit — and an order to remove any copies of the explicit images from the network's platforms."
The Biden admin is taking a dangerous approach to Israel’s other war,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 10:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hezbollah-war-looming-know-rcna159948,"Benny Gantz, a former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff who left his country's war Cabinet last month, was blunt during a security conference when addressing the ongoing conflict at the Israel-Lebanon border last week. “We can bring Lebanon completely into the dark, and take apart Hezbollah’s power in days,” Gantz said. If there is anything Middle East experts can agree on, it’s that a large-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah would be a travesty for all involved. Inside Israel, it’s a different story; many Israelis believe another war with Hezbollah is inevitable, if not long overdue given the security environment Israel has faced since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack undermined the IDF’s perceived invincibility. The IDF have already approved plans for an offensive in Lebanon, and the language from some Israeli officials, including Gantz, suggests an operation will occur sooner or later. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, stressed over the weekend that more Israeli reservists will be deployed to the north as operations in Gaza wind down. It’s a stark departure from where much of the international community stands. On June 21, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres told the U.N. Security Council, “The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.” Days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated to reporters at the Pentagon, “Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war with terrible consequences for the Middle East.” Ditto German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, whose own rhetoric during a recent trip to Israel and Lebanon was nearly identical to America’s top defense official: “Another war would mean a regional escalation on a scale we can hardly imagine.” Washington, for its part, has tried to prevent war in Lebanon by catering its messages depending on the audience. To Hezbollah, the Biden administration is making it plain that, while the U.S.-Israel relationship is tight, it can’t control Israel and it would therefore be wise for the U.S.-designated terrorist group to start cooperating on a diplomatic way out. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to stress to Israel that, although it opposes a war, Washington will have Israel’s back come hell or high water.  President Joe Biden, though, needs to start getting real with Israel. Right now the administration is trying to have it both ways by stressing just how awful an Israel-Hezbollah war would be while echoing that the U.S.'s support is automatic regardless of what Israel decides to do. This is likely to embolden, not discourage, Netanyahu. And it’s a dangerous approach. What the U.S. should be doing instead is making it known to Israeli officials, both publicly and privately, that the U.S. doesn’t support a war in Lebanon and won’t bail it out if it initiates one. Yet just because something is a terrible idea doesn’t necessarily mean it will be avoided. Israel and Hezbollah, two archenemies that have engaged in multiple armed confrontations over the last four decades, are in essence already in a war. Ever since Oct. 8, a day after Hamas’ deadly assault into southern Israel, the IDF and Hezbollah have turned the Israeli-Lebanese border region into their own personal firing range. Hezbollah has launched more than 5,000 anti-tank rockets, drones and missiles against various Israeli targets in the north of the country. Israel, in turn, has conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah positions nearly every day, killing high-ranking field commanders in the process. Nearly 350 Hezbollah fighters have been killed to date, a toll that surpasses the group’s casualty numbers during the 2006 Second Lebanon War. At the time of writing, Israel has registered a total of 25 deaths, 15 military and 10 civilian, on that front. For most of the last eight months, the violence has been relatively contained to within approximately 3.5 miles of the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line, the unofficial boundary between Israel and Lebanon. The fact that tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border were evacuated allowed to keep civilian casualties to a minimum. Yet Israel and Hezbollah’s rhetoric, in addition to deeper Israeli airstrikes into Lebanon and Hezbollah’s use of more sophisticated weapons like precision-guided munitions and drones —one of which injured 18 Israeli troops this weekend — are a bad omen for averting an escalation that the Biden administration is working desperately to prevent. Despite Gantz’s aggressive language, there is some truth to it. Outside of the United States military, the IDF is still the region’s most powerful military force. If Israel can turn Gaza into a wasteland of rubber and rebar, it can certainly do the same thing in Lebanon. This isn’t supposition but fact; Israel has invaded or bombed Lebanon so many times over the preceding decades (1978, 1982, 1993, 1996 and 2006) that it’s difficult to keep track. The 1982 invasion, which aimed to disband Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization for good, was especially deadly for the country, caused considerable friction with the United States and resulted in a nearly two decade-long occupation that created the very terrorist organization — Hezbollah — Israel is now seeking to deter.  The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war was deadly as well. Approximately 1,200 Lebanese lost their lives, as did 158 Israelis (the vast majority of whom were soldiers. Much of Lebanon’s public infrastructure, including the Beirut International Airport, was bombed. Even so, a new war with Hezbollah would make the 2006 conflict look tame in comparison. The 2006 war was a tactical success but a strategical failure for Israel, as it destroyed a decent chunk of Hezbollah’s offensive military capabilities but jeopardized Israel’s international reputation. The Lebanese militia was bloodied but not destroyed. The Hezbollah of 2024 is larger, better armed, more experienced and more politically powerful today than the Hezbollah of 2006. The group continues to boast its insurgent roots but increasingly resembles an army, possessing as many as 200,000 rockets and missiles of various ranges. Some of those missiles can reach any point in Israel, which means that, in the event of a war, Israel’s critical civilian infrastructure — airports, ports, electrical networks and power plants — could be targeted. Millions of Israelis would be living in bomb-shelters as the country’s major cities, from Tel Aviv to Haifa, are subjected to barrages that the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system would have a tough time neutralizing. Israeli ground forces, meanwhile, would be fighting against an organization that learned a great deal about military tactics, processes and procedures after years of ground operations in Syria, where Hezbollah proved crucial in saving Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from becoming the Syrian version of Muammar al-Qaddafi. In short, Israel would be acting against an adversary that is not only the Middle East’s strongest non-state actor but one that frankly fights more effectively than most of the region’s regular armies. The main motivation behind a hypothetical Israeli offensive is to allow its people to return to their homes. This is both a humanitarian and political imperative — humanitarian because Israelis, like people anywhere else, have the right to live in peace; political because a lingering internal displacement crisis is embarrassing for Netanyahu, whose entire career is premised on claims that he is the one man who can assure Israel’s security.  Yet it’s hard to see how launching a full-scale war in Lebanon accomplishes this. Any war is going to produce tremendous materiel and physical damage, not only to the lives of ordinary civilians but also to the towns, small villages and kibbutzim that dot the Israeli side of the Israeli-Lebanese border. Israel’s economy in the north would be even worse off than it is today as more Israelis pull out of the area for their own safety. Israel has to think bigger. Any war with Hezbollah increases the risk of Iran or proxy militias in Syria, Iraq and Yemen escalating their own direct involvement. It’s important to note that Hezbollah is Iran’s most valued asset in the region, a group that is meant to not only tie Israel down but to deter Israel and the United States from taking military action against Iran itself. While Iranian intervention of some sort is not a guarantee, it’s certainly possible if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps believe it’s necessary to preserve Hezbollah’s longevity. U.S. forces deployed in Iraq and Syria wouldn’t be out of the woods either; as demonstrated multiple times in the past, U.S. military outposts in both countries are opportunistic targets for Iran-backed militias who wish to send a message of disapproval about U.S. or Israeli policies. Although attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have largely subsided since the Biden administration bombed dozens of militia and IRGC-linked targets in February — retaliation for a militia drone strike that killed three U.S. troops at a remote basis along the Syrian-Jordanian border — nothing is permanent in the Middle East. U.S. officials will have to be aware that, in any Israel-Hezbollah war, there’s a chance Americans wouldn’t be immune from the fallout.  The Biden administration should keep this in mind and conduct itself wisely with Israel. The U.S. may not be able to control Israeli policy but it doesn’t have to be trapped by it, either. "
The reason Black voters say Trump should drop out won’t surprise anybody but him,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 10:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-black-voters-presidential-debate-rcna159840,"Much of the Democratic Party has been in a full-fledged panic since President Joe Biden’s struggles in Thursday’s CNN debate against Donald Trump. The editorial boards of The New York Times and Atlanta Journal-Constitution channeled some of the most desperate members of that party by arguing that Biden should abandon the race. One vital Democratic voting bloc appears to be somewhat more resistant to this anti-Biden panic, however. Black voters, Democrats’ most reliable voting bloc, are aware of the president’s problems and are divided on whether he should keep fighting or step aside. Yet there appears to be a consensus that Trump's really got no business running. Importantly, this dispels a narrative Trump’s been sharing, that his being booked for crimes a handful of times gave him street cred with Black voters. According to a CBS poll, 74% of Black registered voters say Trump shouldn’t be running for president, and 92% of them cite “decisions he might make in office” as a reason he shouldn’t be running. That same poll found 45% of Black voters think Biden should bow out; and there’s no way to dismiss that as insignificant. That figure must be factoring into the Biden camp’s calculations right now. But it would be punditry malpractice to focus on that number, as high as it is, and not the much higher number who say Trump shouldn’t be in the race. The poll was conducted Friday and Saturday — that is, on the two days after the debate. But something far more consequential than the debate happened Monday: The Supreme Court made it all but impossible to prosecute a president. That ruling will embolden a future President Trump like the matador’s cape emboldens the bull. It seems likely, then, that there would be even more voters — Black, white or otherwise — worried about potential Trump decisions than there were last week, before the rule of law expired.” Departing from the pundits who focused more on how the candidates looked and sounded than on what they said, a plurality of Black registered voters, 39%, said Biden won Thursday’s debate. The next largest, and perhaps the most honest group, was the 35% of respondents who said neither candidate won. Then there was the 25% who said Trump did. As much as reports on the debate have focused on Biden’s difficulty countering Trump’s incessant lying — and cited that difficulty as disqualifying — the Black voters who say Biden won appear to have focused more on those lies. The CBS poll reported that only 10% of the Black registered voters who watched that debate found Trump to be telling the truth. That’s because he didn’t tell the truth. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Sunday, “[T]here was not a single answer Trump gave that did not include some awful prejudice, a preposterously misleading statement or an outright lie, often more than one.” Registered voters surveyed in the CBS poll weren’t given the option to cite Trump’s lying ways as a reason he shouldn’t be a presidential candidate, but of the 74% of Black respondents who said he shouldn’t be a candidate, 98% cited his felony conviction, a consequence of his lying ways, as a reason. Wait, wasn’t his criminal trouble supposed to make him Soul Brother 45? Trump’s response to being convicted in Manhattan — and, before then, having his mug shot snapped in Atlanta — sounded a lot like the nonsense spouted by a clueless white person who bakes on a beach and then finds a Black person and says, “Now I’m just like you!” For example, when speaking to Black conservatives in South Carolina in February about having been indicted multiple times, Trump said, “And a lot of people said that’s why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against. It’s been pretty amazing but possibly, maybe, there’s something there.” Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, a Black Republican, quickly co-signed that foolishness on NBC’s Meet the Press when he told host Kristen Welker that Trump getting indicted “is something similar that Black people have to deal with, with the justice system themselves.” But the finding that three-quarters of Black voters polled think Trump shouldn’t be running and almost every one of them cites his Manhattan convictions as a reason, ought to come as a bracing slap of reality to everybody who has talked about Black voters as simpletons who can’t distinguish between justice and oppression. In advance of Thursday’s debate, Rocky Jones, a Black Atlanta barber, hosted a gathering of Black Republicans that included Donalds, Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas and former HUD Secretary Ben Carson for a discussion on small businesses. Images from the event showed signs on the wall like “Black Americans for Trump” and one with Trump’s mug shot with the words “Never Surrender.” If Black people were really moving into Trump’s column, the way Donalds and other Black Republicans have claimed, then Jones should be feeling pretty good with the attention he got from hosting the event. Instead, he’s been claiming he didn’t know he was hosting a political event. “I feel like I’ve been betrayed,” he told an Atlanta television station. In a social media post, the Trump campaign said, “The business owner signed an agreement with the Trump campaign and received payment for the time spent in his location for this event.” As hard as it is to accept that the Trump campaign is telling the truth about something, it seems likely that Jones is now realizing there aren’t enough “Black Americans for Trump” who want the services a Black barber provides. “We definitely got some calls, some backlash, some angry people…” he told the television station, “and I have to deal with that.” It’s still impossible to know what’s going to happen in this presidential election, or if the two presumed nominees will be the two candidates on the ballot. But it does appear Vote for me because I’ve been arrested just like you people isn’t a winning pitch. As anybody with any respect for Black people should have already known."
Heritage Foundation president raises alarm with cryptic threat,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 9:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/heritage-foundation-american-revolution-threat-bloodless-left-rcna160188,"For the last half-century, the Heritage Foundation has presented itself as the right’s premier think tank, but that only tells part of the story. The organization has also been a key piece of the right’s broader political infrastructure, providing countless staffers for Republican administrations, and helping craft policy proposals adopted by GOP officials at multiple levels of government. All the while, the Heritage Foundation enjoyed an air of respectability. Those looking for conservative cranks and conspiracy theorists were told to look elsewhere — because Heritage, the story went, was serious. These conservatives cared about substance and governing. This think tank, above all others, expected to serve as the flagship of the conservative movement, home to the right’s preeminent scholarship and academic research. In time, however, as Republican politics grew more radical, the Heritage Foundation shifted, too. In 2013, then-Sen. Orrin Hatch told MSNBC, “Heritage used to be the conservative organization helping Republicans and helping conservatives and helping us to be able to have the best intellectual conservative ideas. There’s a real question in the minds of many Republicans right now, and I’m not just speaking for myself: Is Heritage going to go so political that it really doesn’t amount to anything anymore?” Eleven years later, the idea that the Heritage Foundation is producing “the best intellectual conservative ideas” is plainly laughable, as its president reminded the public again yesterday. HuffPost noted: “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless ― if the left allows it to be,” Kevin Roberts, president of the right-wing Heritage Foundation, said on a conservative media outlet called Real America’s Voice. Pointing to Republican Supreme Court justices elevating the American presidency above the law, Roberts said in the same interview, “We’re in the process of taking this country back.” Not surprisingly, more than a few observers interpreted his “bloodless — if the left allows it to be” comments as a not-so-subtle threat. And while those concerns are warranted, they’re made worse by the broader significance of Heritage’s ongoing political efforts. Who’s responsible for the radical Project 2025 agenda? The Heritage Foundation. Who’s “pre-screening the ideologies” of thousands of people in the hopes of installing “a pre-vetted, pro-Trump army of up to 54,000 loyalists” across the federal government? The Heritage Foundation. Who’s funding an apparent blacklist of federal government workers who might stand in the way of a MAGA agenda? The Heritage Foundation. Who put up billboards in Alabama in support of Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville while he undermined his own country’s military? The Heritage Foundation. Which group’s former staffers have complained about their former employers prioritizing political messaging over policy formation? The Heritage Foundation. Whose president might be in contention for White House chief of staff in a second Trump term? The Heritage Foundation. It was against this backdrop that Heritage’s chief told a national television audience, “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless ― if the left allows it to be,” which was every bit as unsettling as it seemed."
Biden jokes he ‘almost fell asleep’ on the debate stage. It doesn’t help his case at all.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 9:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-debate-fell-asleep-travel-schedule-rcna160137,"President Joe Biden, facing increasing pressure to leave the 2024 race, seemingly joked at a campaign event Tuesday that he had been so weary from his June travel schedule that he “almost fell asleep” on the debate stage. “I wasn’t very smart,” he said at the fundraiser in Northern Virginia, adding: “I decided to travel around the world a couple of times ... shortly before the debate. ... I didn’t listen to my staff … and then I almost fell asleep onstage.” Biden said it was “not an excuse but an explanation.” NBC News reported that it wasn’t clear how much the president was joking about nearly falling asleep. The president did, in fact, have an intense itinerary in the weeks leading up to the debate: He flew to France and Italy on two separate trips to meet with foreign leaders, and from Italy he flew to California for a fundraiser before returning to Washington. Then he dove into debate preparations at Camp David. But the explanation for his hapless showing at the debate and the suggestion that he could have done even worse that night does little to assuage fears that he, at 81, is too old and too infirm to serve four more years as president. What’s more, his remark about nearly falling asleep onstage plays directly into Donald Trump’s “Sleepy Joe” nickname for him. As the panic within the Democratic Party deepens, Biden’s inner circle is reportedly growing even more defiant and isolated. The New York Times reported that the president has been experiencing increasingly frequent cognitive lapses, echoing The Wall Street Journal’s reporting about Biden’s mental acuity from early June. One Democratic member of Congress has already called for Biden to withdraw from the race. Even as prominent Democrats reiterate their support, not everyone is entirely rejecting the possibility of replacing Biden on the ticket."

Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a top Republican target this year, will not appear alongside Biden when he visits Madison on Friday. * On the same day that Democratic Rep. Jared Golden said he expects Donald Trump to win in November, one of the Maine congressman’s closest allies, Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, came to the same conclusion. * Speaking of Democrats in competitive races, Colorado’s Adam Frisch, who nearly upset Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert two years ago, yesterday called on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race. * In light of the incumbent president’s post-debate difficulties, the Trump campaign has reportedly delayed the announcement about the former president’s new running mate. The strategy isn’t complicated: Republicans don’t want to give the political world something new to talk about. * Vanity Fair this week published a report that accused independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of, among other things, sexually assaulting a babysitter and possibly eating a dog. On a YouTube program, the conspiracy theorist refused to comment about the allegations, though he did say, “Listen, I’ve said this from the beginning: I am not a church boy.”"
Speaker Johnson rejects possibility of ‘crazy criminal activity’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 8:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-mike-johnson-trump-immunity-crazy-criminal-activity-rcna160166,"In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. U.S., which effectively put the American presidency above the law, a great many observers started imagining the practical implications of a lawless presidency. In fact, one of the dissenters in the case explored some of those possibilities. “The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. “When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune. “Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority’s message today.” Hours later, as The Hill noted, Congress’ top Republican lawmaker adopted a far more relaxed posture. “Look, there’s all sorts of hyperbole tonight ... and just this, fantastical, these hypotheticals they’ve made up [that] future presidents are going to turn into assassins and all the rest,” the Louisiana Republican told Fox News. “It’s madness.” Johnson added, “Listen, remember this. The president and vice president are the only two officers in our constitutional system that are elected by all the people, no one who is elected to that office is going to be prone to this kind of crazy criminal activity.” The House speaker’s lack of concern is well taken. Why assume that the United States would ever have a president who engaged in “crazy criminal activity”? It’s not as if Americans have ever seen a president who, for example, ran a fraudulent charity, a fraudulent “university,” and a business that was convicted on multiple felony fraud counts. And it's not as if we’d have a president who launched an illegal extortion scheme against a foreign ally in the hopes that he’d help the incumbent cheat in an election. And the United States would certainly never elect a president who falsified business records as part of an illegal hush-money scheme after allegedly cheating on his third wife with a porn star. And it’s silly to think an American president would defy a federal subpoena and keep highly sensitive national security secrets at his glorified country club. And voters would obviously never elect a president who tried to use the levers of federal power to target his perceived political foes in his own country. And we’d never elect someone who was held liable for sexual assault, just as it’s silly to think an American president would get indicted for trying to overturn an election and deploying a radicalized mob to attack the U.S. Capitol as part of an apparent coup attempt. Given these realizations, Johnson’s case sure is persuasive. No one elected to the nation’s highest office would ever be prone to “crazy criminal activity.”"
Only one person can reset the narrative about Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 8:24 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/joe-biden-age-narrative-rcna160040,"President Joe Biden lost ground at the debate, but he risks losing the race due to the way his team has handled things since. There’s a sense of permanence setting in, and that's the last thing that any candidate wants. The reason the last week has been so bad for the Biden campaign is because it’s not acknowledging reality. The American people are wrestling with a few very hard questions. First, can Biden be president today? The answer is yes. Look at his record, look at how he’s performing, look at what he has delivered at home and on the world stage. Second, can he be president for the next four years? The Biden camp's most powerful line of the last week came from Biden himself. He said he wouldn't ask for the American people's support if he knew he couldn’t do the job for the next four years. He said, “Trust me, I can do this.” Those are powerful words. The third question is: Can he win? And that’s what you see the Beltway pundits and Democrats wrestling with now. What Biden’s team needs to recognize is that telling Democrats to buckle down, breathe through their noses, not panic and ignore what they saw isn’t enough. The Biden coalition isn’t just Democrats. It’s a lot of soft Republicans, independents and soft Democrats who come out for Joe, but are not loyal or excited about the party. And just rallying loyal Democrats right now isn’t enough. And so, the only person who can reset the narrative about Joe Biden is Joe Biden. Not his team. Not calls with donors or loyalists or “Never Trumpers.” Forget about party loyalty. We haven’t had a national conversation about an aging president this intense since Ronald Reagan’s second term. The spin doctors in Washington, D.C., are going to say what they want to say. But only Biden can convince the American people he can see this campaign through successfully. And ultimately, that's the only thing that is going to reset this race.  This is an adapted excerpt from the July 1 episode of “Chris Jansing Reports.”"
Why the Supreme Court’s immunity decision might impact Trump’s New York verdict,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-conviction-new-york-rcna160033,         
Trump still struggling with the plain meaning of ‘exoneration’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 7:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-still-struggling-plain-meaning-exoneration-rcna160154,"It’s been nearly five weeks since a New York jury found Donald Trump guilty of 34 felonies, though the former president is still awaiting sentencing. According to the original plan, the Republican criminal was set to learn his fate next week. That plan has since changed: The judge in the case approved a delay sentencing until at least September 18, allowing Trump’s lawyers to review the potential impact of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. As USA Today reported, the presumptive GOP nominee responded to the news in an overly excited way. The same online missive added, “It is clear that the Supreme Court’s Brilliantly Written and Historic Decision ENDS all of Crooked Joe Biden’s Witch Hunts against me, including the WHITE HOUSE AND DOJ INSPIRED CIVIL HOAXES in New York.” At this point, we could talk about why the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. U.S. was not “brilliantly written,” why Trump’s hush-money case isn’t over, why there’s literally no evidence of President Joe Biden being “crooked,” why Trump’s legal problems are neither “witch hunts” nor “hoaxes,” why the White House has nothing to do with the former president’s prosecutions, and why the Justice Department is unrelated to the Republican’s criminal case in New York.  We could even pause to marvel at the lie-to-word ratio, which was quite extraordinary, and which reflected Trump’s fractured relationship with reality.  But what stood out as especially notable was Trump’s latest claim to “total exoneration.” The truth, of course, is that the Supreme Court concluded that official presidential acts are immune from prosecution, but that’s not the same thing as “total exoneration.” In the hush-money case, jurors still found the Republican defendant guilty of crimes unrelated to Trump’s official duties. In fact, much of the case focused on events that predated his inauguration. At no point has any judge or court wiped the slate clean, undoing the jury’s verdict. Trump’s claims to the contrary were absurd. But they were also familiar. For those who’ve kept an eye on the former president’s rhetoric over time, he has some unmistakable tells. When Trump tells stories, for example, about big, burly men who profess their love for him while crying, he’s lying. When he vows to release information in “two weeks,” he’s lying. And similarly, when the Republican uses the word “exoneration,” he’s lying. Let’s revisit some of our earlier coverage and take a stroll down memory lane. In March 2018, Trump claimed that the House Intelligence Committee had completely exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That wasn’t true. In June 2018, Trump said the Justice Department inspector general’s office had “totally” exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That was both wrong and kind of bonkers. In February 2019, Trump claimed that the Senate Intelligence Committee had also exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That also wasn’t true. In March 2019, Trump claimed the judge in a Paul Manafort trial exonerated him, too. That also wasn’t true. In June 2021, Trump claimed he’d been “totally exonerated” by testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn, which was largely the opposite of the truth. In February 2023, Trump insisted that a special grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia had rewarded him with “total exoneration.” That not only didn’t happen, that same special grand jury criminally indicted him soon after. In June 2023, Trump published an item to his social media platform, declaring that he’s been “totally exonerated” in the classified documents scandal that led to a federal indictment. That was also the opposite of the truth. In June 2024, Trump claimed to have been “exonerated“ for referencing the “very fine people” he saw protesting in Charlottesville. That wasn’t true, either. And in July 2024, pointed to “total exoneration” in the hush-money case, which didn't make any sense at all. There’s no great mystery as to the former president’s motivations. Trump has faced a series of controversies, each of which has caused political damage, and he’s been desperate to convince the public that he’s been cleared — in every instance — of any meaningful wrongdoing. But either Trump doesn’t know what “exonerated” means or he’s spent years trying to deceive the public about his culpability in a variety of serious scandals — or, more likely, both.

Bob Good’s Republican’s primary loss is certified in Virginia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 6:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bob-goods-republicans-primary-loss-certified-virginia-rcna160132,"In recent months, quite a few congressional Republicans have faced primary challenges, though in every instance, the GOP incumbents have prevailed. That is, except for Rep. Bob Good, whose apparent primary defeat in Virginia was certified by the state elections board yesterday. NBC News reported: Good, the chair of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, has already made clear that he will, in fact, pursue a recount. As for the larger context, in recent years, a variety of congressional Republican incumbents have come up short in primary races because they lost the backing of the GOP’s rabid far-right base. Good’s apparent defeat is something altogether different. As regular readers know, the GOP lawmaker dismissed the pandemic as a “phony“ crisis, championed a baseless impeachment crusade against President Joe Biden, and helped take the lead in pushing a debt ceiling crisis. The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank went so far to refer to Good as a “legislative terrorist.” There was, in other words, no reason for the party’s base to kick Good out. His allegiance to far-right orthodoxy has never been in doubt. So why is his congressional career coming to an apparent end? There are a few angles to this story that are worth keeping in mind. First, Good played a prominent role in ousting then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which generated some ill will within the party. Indeed, the Californian still has a political operation of sorts, and it was turned against the Virginian. Second, Good’s colleagues have come to see him as something of a joke: Even one of his Freedom Caucus colleagues recently conceded that Good is not a serious policymaker. Another GOP member predicted a few weeks ago, “The only Republican incumbent that loses this cycle is going to be Bob Good. And he won’t lose because of policy, but because of tactics and because his colleagues overwhelmingly do not trust or respect him.” But perhaps most importantly, the Virginia Republican endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Donald Trump in the GOP’s presidential primary — at which point some of his ostensible allies labeled him a “disloyal MAGA traitor.” It didn’t take long for Good to acknowledge his political difficulties, and in January, he endorsed Trump. The Virginian was also one of the many congressional Republicans to travel to the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse to show his support for the former president during his recent criminal trial. But Trump concluded that the gestures were “too late,” adding, “The damage had been done!” In late March, The Washington Post quoted John Fredericks, a conservative Virginia radio show host who’s been part of Trumpworld for years, who said Good’s fate was in the former president's hands. “If Trump endorses McGuire, McGuire is going to win,” Fredericks said. Two months later, Trump endorsed McGuire, who appears to have won. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Dems' Golden peddles misplaced optimism about Trump, democracy",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 5:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-golden-peddles-misplaced-optimism-trump-democracy-rcna160123,"With just a few days remaining before Election Day 2016, The Washington Post’s Kathleen Parker wrote a notorious column. “Calm down,” the headline read. “We’ll be fine no matter who wins.” Parker’s argument at the time was that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offered competing visions, but Americans who were concerned about the nation’s future had no reason to feel too much anxiety about the outcome of the competitive race. As Trump’s presidency unfolded, Parker’s misplaced optimism became infamous. The lesson for political observers seemed obvious: Don’t underestimate the amount of damage one radical and transgressive president can do in short order. It’s a lesson Democratic Rep. Jared Golden apparently did not learn. In fact, in an op-ed for the Bangor Daily News, the three-term Maine congressman not only predicts a Trump victory, he argues that there’s no reason to be overly concerned about the damage the Republican might do. The best-case scenario is that Golden knows better, but he wrote a strange op-ed in order to distance himself from his national party and align himself with his more conservative, rural constituents. The worst-case scenario is that Golden actually believes what he wrote. The Maine Democrat’s op-ed is worth reading in its entirety, if for no other reason than to marvel at the oddity of his claims. Amanda Carpenter did a fine job highlighting some of the congressman’s more glaring errors of judgment, and her online thread is definitely worth checking out. But I’m also curious what more Trump would have to do in order to cause Golden to feel some anxiety. For all intents and purposes, the presumptive Republican nominee isn’t just running against President Joe Biden, Trump is also running against democracy itself. We’re talking about a radical, twice-impeached felon who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings for federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump's ideological ambitions. Just as importantly, Republicans on the Supreme Court this week effectively told Trump that if he were to return to the Oval Office, he could take comfort in knowing that he’s above the law, leading a lawless presidency. To hear Golden tell it, the United States has endured before, so we should simply assume that the United States will continue to endure in the future. The problem with such misplaced optimism is that sometimes, countries face new and unique threats that are different and more serious than earlier challenges, and the result is unprecedented peril. For the Maine Democrat to simply shrug his shoulders with indifference is to wonder whether he’s paid close enough attention to current events and world history."
Why Michelle Obama’s polling lead over Trump (sort of) matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/michelle-obamas-polling-lead-trump-sort-matters-rcna160119,"It’s not exactly a secret that President Joe Biden’s re-election prospects have faltered in the wake of last week’s debate. Most of the latest polls show Donald Trump’s advantage growing; some Democrats have called on the incumbent president to end his 2024 candidacy; and others in Biden’s party have started distancing themselves from the presumptive Democratic nominee. With this in mind, it’s easy to understand why pollsters would start asking voters, not only about Biden-Trump match-ups, but also about what the presidential race would look like if the president weren’t at the top of the Democratic ticket in the fall. Over the last 24 hours, two national surveys — a Reuters/Ipsos poll and a CNN poll conducted by SSRS — found the former Republican president leading each of the Democrats whose names are often included in speculative chatter about the 2024 race. There was, however, one notable exception. From the Reuters report: At this point, let’s pause to acknowledge reality: There is literally no reason whatsoever to think the former first lady will run for public office, this year or any other. Michelle Obama has been categorical on this point on multiple occasions, across several election cycles. As recently as March of this year, in a statement to NBC News, the former first lady’s office tried to rein in imaginations, making it clear her 2024 plans don’t include running for office. “As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,” her communications director said. “Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign.” In other words, I have some advice for those ready to put a “Michelle Obama 2024” bumper-sticker on their car: Don’t bother. It’s a near-certainty that this candidacy will not happen. So if the former first lady simply isn’t interested, what difference does it make that she has a double-digit lead over the presumptive GOP nominee? If this is all in the realm of fantasy, why take note of polling related to a hypothetical contest that won’t happen? The answer has less to do with Michelle Obama and more to do with the Republican candidate she leads by 11 points. To hear Trump and his acolytes tell it, the former president isn’t just a candidate, he’s also the head of a powerful political movement. What’s more, as far as Republicans are concerned, Trump’s lead in the polls isn’t rooted in an anti-Democrat sentiment; it’s the result of an American electorate that loves the presumptive GOP nominee and is clamoring to vote for him. Perhaps, though in a match-up against the former first lady, Trump not only trails by double digits, he also fails to crack 40%. The point is, Michelle Obama’s polling lead suggests there’s a broad political appetite for someone other than the former president. The challenge for Democrats is presenting those voters with a ticket they’ll be excited about."
The Supreme Court has signed off on a Trump takeover of the DOJ,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-doj-rcna159968,"In the process of granting former President Donald Trump immunity for at least some of his actions between Election Day 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021, the Supreme Court’s sweeping decision also provided a stamp of approval for one of the most dangerous parts of Trump’s second-term agenda: payback. In doing so, the justices rolled back one of the key post-Watergate reforms preventing presidents from abusing their vast power, freeing Trump, if he’s re-elected, to use the Department of Justice as his personal weapon. The scheme Trump and his allies cooked up in 2020 involved enlisting the Justice Department to give their lies about widespread election fraud an official patina. Then-Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark drafted a letter to send to several states, including Georgia, that would falsely claim that “various irregularities” existed that cast those states’ election results into doubt. Had it been sent, the letter would have encouraged those state legislatures to convene special sessions to “investigate” and potentially send to Congress slates flipping the states’ Electoral College votes to Trump. When the acting attorney general refused to send the letter, Trump threatened to fire him and replace him with Clark. He yielded only when a slew of top Justice Department officials promised to resign in protest. Apparently, though, according to the Supreme Court, there was nothing about that chain of events that falls outside the scope of the president’s “official acts.” As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 6-3 opinion, “The President may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” The line seems innocuous compared to some of the other more dumbfounding statements within the decision, but the problem is that it’s written as though there was nothing wrong about the content of those discussions. A few paragraphs later, Roberts clarifies that sentence’s importance in explaining why the pressure campaign against Justice Department officials can’t be used to as part of the federal case against Trump: Putting those two ideas together effectively signs off on ending the last 50 years of Justice Department independence. The way then-President Richard Nixon and his attorney general, John Mitchell, used and abused the DOJ and other law enforcement bodies to shield Nixon’s allies and harass his enemies was one of the most damaging revelations of Watergate. Following Nixon’s resignation and Mitchell’s eventual prosecution and conviction, subsequent attorneys general have all strived to keep the White House at arm’s length from the day-to-day decisions regarding investigations. But there were few legislative reforms that safeguarded the Justice Department from being used as a political tool — it has almost entirely been the work of norms and precedents that have cut across administrations. Even Trump’s White House counsel Don McGahn issued a memo at the beginning of his term laying out the firewall between the White House staff and the Justice Department. It’s a standard that Trump’s allies, including Clark, have railed against, making no bones about the fact that, if given the chance, they intend to tear it down entirely. If that happens, there will be little to prevent Trump from launching his promised revenge campaign against his enemies. Given the leeway Roberts has granted for the president to order even “sham” investigations, anyone could be subject to arbitrary probes, prompting unnecessary (and expensive) legal defenses and social stigma. It’s not absurd to imagine this resulting in the arrest and detention on made-up charges for anyone on the long list of people who’ve earned Trump’s ire. Conversely, this ruling also seems on its face to allow a president to order an investigation to end for any reason. Under Roberts’ test, there would be no means for a court to assess, for example, whether Trump’s corruptly ordering that a GOP megadonor be beyond Justice Department scrutiny was a criminal violation of the law. Instead, the court’s conservatives have chosen to write this opinion from a worldview that assumes every “official act” taken by the president within his authority is legal and constitutional. Roberts attempted to give the illusion that opinion was written with anyone but Trump in mind, and in doing so, he obscured how far removed from the average president Trump is. What Roberts frames as a simple declaration of the president’s authorities under the Constitution is now poised to become Trump’s go-ahead to target the political opposition with impunity. Likewise, in granting presidents the broadest benefit of the doubt possible to “take care that the laws are faithfully executed,” the court has all but guaranteed that, if Trump is returned to power, he will do the exact opposite."
Joe Biden is getting the most important advice from the least qualified people,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-age-debate-2024-election-rcna159918,"After President Joe Biden’s catastrophic debate performance Thursday, a number of top Democratic donors are expressing anxiety to the White House, and many commentators — including the editorial board of The New York Times — have called for him to end his candidacy for the White House and allow another Democrat to replace him.  But those closest to the president disagree. Biden’s family has reportedly encouraged him to stay in the race. His aides have rallied behind him and are pushing back aggressively against questions about his physical and cognitive fitness for 2024. This pushback campaign at times has gone beyond firmly executed damage control and evolved into arrogant dismissals of a vital conversation. “The bedwetting brigade is calling for Joe Biden to ‘drop out,’” Robert Flaherty, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, wrote in a campaign email Sunday.  Biden’s inner circle seems more resolute than ever that he still has the juice. But their track record suggests that, at this crucial juncture, they are among the very last people who should be trusted to assess whether Biden should remain in the race.  Biden’s debate performance made it plainly obvious that the president has trouble communicating clearly and coherently; as he struggled to spar with Trump, he frequently spoke almost inaudibly, struggled to remember numbers and policy details and even failed to complete sentences at all. Biden’s behavior tracks with The Wall Street Journal’s reporting in June, based on several sources familiar with Biden meetings, that the president has shown notable lapses in memory and struggled to communicate his ideas. After the debate, Axios, citing current and former Biden aides, reported that Biden appears to have limited hours in the day during which he’s fully engaged. (NBC News has not independently confirmed these reports.)  Whatever the reality behind the scenes, Biden’s recent public appearances have shown a man greatly diminished by age in his ability to communicate — an utterly essential skill for any president. Ultimately his debate performance alone — a stunning decline from just four years ago — has been enough to rattle many people who have been supportive of the Biden presidency and would otherwise love to see him run for another term. It almost goes without saying that Biden’s family members — who are urging him to stay in the race — are poorly positioned to counsel the president on this matter. They of course have a deep personal attachment to Biden and, having seen him age for many years, may be too close to appreciate the full scope and scale of his decline. Like any family, they’re going to find it painful to admit that he has exhausted his ability to fulfill his vocation. They typically see him when he’s more relaxed; they aren’t sitting in on high-stakes negotiations with him. And of course they also have a personal interest in his remaining in the White House, because the presidency confers many unique advantages and opportunities upon a president’s family.  Biden’s inner circle of staffers may also be unusually prone to similar biases. To begin with, like any group of political aides, they have a natural incentive to try to keep the boss’ prospects afloat — and preserve their own power to steer the ship of state. But as The Atlantic’s Franklin Foer, author of a book on Biden’s first two years in office, points out, this dynamic is exacerbated by the fact that Biden’s top aides have all been with him for so long: Is it possible that some of them harbor private doubts or ambivalence about Biden’s competence? Of course. But in general the “familial” ties that define Biden’s team make it less likely they will confront Biden with hard conversations.  The people who are most likely to be able to move the needle are not in the White House but outside it. If Biden were to step down, it most likely would require former Democratic presidents, Democratic leaders in Congress and other top Democratic elites to come out in concert against Biden. These are players who are better positioned to put the interest of the party first and are less likely to be compromised by self-interest or emotional ties. So far, we’re very far from anything like that happening. Regardless of where you stand on the question of whether Biden should step down on a strategic level, it should be clear that he should be getting advice from those best qualified to offer it — and those closest to him do not fall in that category.

RFK Jr.’s response to allegations of sexual assault: ‘I am who I am’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-f-kennedy-sexual-assault-allegation-dog-vanity-fair-rcna160048,"On Tuesday, Vanity Fair published an explosive piece about independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that was rife with shocking details, including allegations that he sexually assaulted a babysitter he employed and that he may have eaten a dog. According to Vanity Fair’s reporting (which has not been verified by MSNBC), a woman named Eliza Cooney, who had been hired to babysit Kennedy’s children in 1998 when she was 23, alleged that he groped her or behaved inappropriately toward her on three occasions. Cooney told the publication that she wrote about the first incident in her diary at the time and that she had confided in her mother in 2017 during the height of the #MeToo movement. She said she had also told several of her friends about Kennedy’s alleged behavior last year, after he announced his run for president. Kennedy did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment on the allegations. But asked about the assault allegations in an interview on “Breaking Points,” a YouTube show, he said he would not respond to the details, adding that he had a “rambunctious youth.” (Kennedy was in his 40s when the incidents are alleged to have occurred.) “Listen, I’ve said this from the beginning: I am not a church boy,” he told the interviewer Tuesday. “I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I — I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they all vote, I could run for king of the world.” He said the magazine was “recycling 30-year-old stories,” adding: “I’m not going to comment on the details of any of them, but it’s — you know, I am who I am.” When asked point-blank whether he was denying Cooney’s allegations, Kennedy repeated that he was not going to comment. A number of sensational details about Kennedy’s past have come to light in recent months as his campaign seeks to make its mark in the 2024 election. In May, The New York Times reported that he had disclosed a number of medical issues in a deposition during his divorce from his second wife, including that doctors found a worm that had eaten part of his brain. In the interview Tuesday, Kennedy not only seemed to dismiss the allegation of sexual assault, but he also denied that he had eaten a barbecued dog. Vanity Fair reported that he sent his friend a photo last year suggesting that he had sampled dog meat. Kennedy reportedly told the friend, who was traveling to Asia, that he might like a restaurant in Korea that had dog on its menu. “The picture that they said is of me eating a dog is actually me eating a goat,” he insisted, “in Patagonia.”"
The Karen Read trial was fascinating. Get ready to do it all over again.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/karen-read-verdict-mistrial-rcna160037,"After five days of deliberations following a nine-week murder trial for Massachusetts woman Karen Read, a mistrial was declared and the jury was excused by the judge, Beverly Cannone. The jurors indicated that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on Read’s charges of second-degree murder of her boyfriend, John O’Keefe, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene of an accident causing a fatality.  On two occasions since deliberations began, the jury notified the court that it was unable to find unanimity. The second time, which was just this past Monday, the jury’s letter stated that “the divergence in our views are not rooted in a lack of understanding or effort but deeply held convictions that each of us carry, ultimately leading to a point where consensus is unobtainable.” Upon receipt of this note, Judge Cannone read instructions to the jury to force them to continue to deliberate. Called “Tuey-Rodriguez instructions” in Massachusetts, these explained that the verdict must not be “merely an acquiescence in the conclusion of the other jurors,” and that the preference is to obtain a verdict. Despite these Tuey-Rodriguez instructions, the jury of six men and six women ultimately admitted that they were deadlocked on whether the prosecution had met its burden of proof to convict. The prosecution immediately announced that it intended to retry Read. Her defense team responded, “We will not stop fighting.” As I previously wrote, Read alleged that there was a conspiracy to cover up O’Keefe’s murder by his fellow law enforcement officers and the defense argued that the forensic evidence as explained by their experts corroborated this theory. During the trial, Read also pointed the finger at a possible suspect: an ATF agent with whom she had been exchanging flirtatious texts prior to O’Keefe’s death. Considering the prosecution’s intent to retry Read, the landscape of a second trial will be decidedly different, and more refined. There will be a transcript of that first trial, which will include the testimony from all of the witnesses, both fact and expert, legal arguments made in court by both sides, jury selection issues, and other nuances that are now officially the record of the first trial. This kind of insight into the entirety of the theories and themes on both sides of the case is priceless. As a trial lawyer, you want to be able not only to repeat the good, but to anticipate the bad/what didn’t work in the first iteration of the trial so you can avoid those pitfalls the second time around. Having that transcript and knowledge going into the second trial will expedite and enhance your trial prep considerably. The retrial may not happen quickly, though. According to a local CBS affiliate in Boston, the Norfolk Superior Court trial calendar is full and a second trial may not be scheduled for several months. A status hearing is teed up for July 22 and at that time, some clarity should be provided by the judge as to a new trial date.  Of course, the jury will be an entirely different group of people in the re-trial, meaning the dynamics will not be the same. And seating a jury might pose an issue: During the first trial, more than 400 potential jurors were called for jury duty. Only 17 people qualified to serve and 12 were ultimately selected. Seating jurors for high-profile cases can be difficult due to pre-trial publicity and a number of other challenges. Media coverage of Read’s trial, especially in the Boston area, has been extensive and will surely further narrow the potential jury pool for the second trial. Despite the prosecution’s hasty announcement of a retrial, these difficulties of securing a jury may end up factoring into the DA’s Office’s decision of how to approach the second trial. One especially noteworthy development since the mistrial announcement Monday is the fact that the case’s lead investigator, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, has now been “relieved of duty” and will be transferred out of the detective unit. This move is separate from an ongoing internal investigation into Proctor’s “serious misconduct.” During the trial, Proctor testified for the prosecution and was then cross-examined about inappropriate and crude texts about Read that he sent to friends, family and fellow law enforcement officers. These texts revealed that he called her several names, like “whack-job c---” and “re------,” mocked her medical conditions, and said to his supervisors that he did not find any nude photos of Read while searching her phone. He also texted his sister that he hoped Read would “kill herself” and revealed investigative details to friends and family on a text thread. Read’s defense highlighted Proctor’s egregious misconduct during the trial and alleged that Proctor planted evidence as a part of the cover-up conspiracy. Even the governor of Massachusetts said she was “disgusted” by Proctor’s conduct and that it could tarnish the integrity of law enforcement in her state. Proctor being relieved of duty will be a huge obstacle to the prosecution’s strategy in any retrial of Read. As the lead investigator on the case, this latest development will be an even bigger part of Read’s defense. After the mistrial was declared, one of the alternate jurors spoke with the media, stating that if she had deliberated, she would have found Read not guilty: “I believe the Commonwealth did not do their job to convince me beyond a reasonable doubt that Karen Read was guilty of the charges.” When asked about the influence of Proctor’s testimony on her feelings about the case, she responded: “Even if his testimony had not been included in this case, I still believe there would not have been enough.”  Given all we learned during the first trial, the prosecution should take a beat to decide whether retrying Karen Read actually makes sense. Sometimes, even if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, the prosecution will pursue another trial because they still believe that the facts and the evidence align with the charges and that it serves the interests of justice to do so — even if the verdict ends up being an acquittal. We shall soon see whether the prosecution rethinks its plan, or chooses to push forward with a new trial, challenges and all."
I helped prosecute Watergate. The Supreme Court just proved Richard Nixon right.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-immunity-trump-ruling-richard-nixon-rcna159846,"After the Supreme Court’s ruling Monday in Trump v. U.S., former White House counsel John Dean wrote that the court had “affirmed” the claim of Dean’s former boss, President Richard Nixon: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” As a member of the Watergate special prosecution team that brought Nixon to accountability, and won the Supreme Court’s U.S. v. Nixon ruling that the president is not above the law, I agree. And I add: Rest in peace, democracy and the rule of law. Monday’s 6-3 ruling creates an imperial presidency Nixon would have loved. The opinion means he would not have been forced to resign and would have served out his full term. His use of the Justice Department, CIA, FBI and his White House and campaign staffs as part of a conspiracy to obstruct justice through perjury, hush money and other crimes — all to cover up his role and theirs in a criminal break-in while he was in office — would no longer be a crime. Worse, Monday’s ruling means that former President Donald Trump cannot be held fully accountable now, and maybe ever, for using his presidential powers in a conspiracy to attempt to overturn a free and fair election. True, the court does withhold immunity for a president’s purely personal, unofficial conduct while in office. It does not immunize him for conduct before or after he was in office. But it does grant absolute immunity for one category of conduct and presumptive immunity for another category. It requires the prosecution to rebut the presumption of immunity before the charges can be tried by a jury, and it limits the evidence the prosecution can use to do that. The court grants absolute immunity to conduct it says falls within the president’s “core” constitutional responsibilities. That severely limits what the court held 50 years ago in U.S. v. Nixon, and is unlike anything in our history. That case held a president is not above the law and must be treated as any other citizen. Yet on Monday, the current Supreme Court tossed that reasoning out the window. Instead, the Trump decision created a subjective standard vulnerable to the court’s whims and ideologies. It held that “Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.” It did so even though those discussions concerned sending letters to states falsely claiming fraud in the 2020 election and urging them to overturn the results. It did so even though special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment lays out how those conversations were part of an overall conspiracy to obstruct a peaceful transfer of power, conduct that was intended to and would have denied all citizens’ votes being counted. The court did not categorize the other acts alleged in the Jan. 6 special counsel’s indictment, such as the fraudulent slates of electors, as part of the president’s core powers. But the majority declares those actions “at least” presumptively immune, and that the prosecution must rebut that presumption.   Common sense tells us all these actions were clearly the acts of a candidate, not legitimate uses of presidential authority. If this conspiracy is an “official” act, what isn’t? If the Supreme Court can conclude that Trump’s alleged pressuring of the Justice Department is immune, why don’t they also say whether Trump’s calls to Georgia’s secretary of state or his pressuring of Vice President Mike Pence and others are also immune? Why is it necessary to hand the issue to the lower courts when those acts seem to almost everyone definitively unofficial and prosecutable? These should not be open questions. If former President Trump gets a second term, he and his administration will feel safe in acting with abandon. There will be no guardrails. A maliciously inclined president will not be constrained by the possibility that a future court might consider his conduct unofficial. Nixon would be delighted. This court seems to have found a way to interpret the law and facts here to support the concept espoused by Nixon and his top aides that the ends justify the means and if the president does it, it is not illegal. Worse yet, unlike the opinion in U.S. v Nixon, the court hobbles the prosecutor by limiting the evidence that can be used to rebut the presumption of immunity at a hearing on what allegations remain for trial, as well as limiting the evidence that can be used at trial. That ruling is a gift to Trump’s defense and wholly unnecessary. Federal Rules of Evidence 403 would allow the trial court to make that determination in context of whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial harm. Monday’s ruling makes it harder to prosecute the most overt of actions even after the prosecution successfully rebuts the presumption of immunity. Finally, Monday’s ruling denies voters a timely ruling on the charges against Trump. Any decision on classifying an act will be appealed to the Circuit Court and then back up to the Supreme Court, leading to delay, delay, delay. The result is, to borrow from Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent, “immune, immune, immune.” As Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson wrote in her dissent, the majority opinion is a “five alarm fire.”  Once again the conservative justices, who claim to be originalists and textualists, blatantly ignore what our Founders said. “The President of the United States,” Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist No. 69, “would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.” But the majority has discarded such guidance, because it does not serve their purpose here. Earlier this year, Justice Sotomayor admitted that “there are days that I’ve come to my office … and closed my door and cried. There have been those days. And there are likely to be more.” No one would begrudge her if Monday was one of “those days.” As Sotomayor concluded her powerful rebuttal to the majority, “with fear for our democracy, I dissent.” And so should we all."

The frightening consequences of Monday’s conservative Supreme Court decision granting Donald Trump and future presidents partial immunity for crimes committed as part of “official acts” are far-reaching. My first thought was about how this ruling concerning Trump’s assault on our democratic system appears to have legalized similar attacks in the future.  My second thought — and one I’d love to see more discussion about — concerns the potential surveillance implications. University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq is one of the few sources I’ve seen discussing this. He’s quoted in Politico saying the ruling “licenses the misuse of … the surveillance and intrusive powers of the national security state.” Over the past couple of years here on the ReidOut Blog, I’ve been writing about emerging technologies and their potential uses by bad actors who could deploy them to infringe on civil rights — everything from geofence warrants and other tools that can track potential abortion-seekers to robot police dogs that can surveil and attack at a moment’s notice.  Presidents have already been given broad latitude to snoop on Americans without the new concept of presidential immunity that conservatives on the Supreme Court just invented. If Trump is elected in November and conservatives execute their plan to pack the government with pro-Trump loyalists, he will be armed with the most powerful surveillance technologies ever invented. It’s easy to see his Department of Justice devising purportedly “official” reasons to use them with impunity.  Here are some other stories I've had on my mind: OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot, two generative AI chatbots frequently used to surface information from the internet, were found to have fed their users right-wing propaganda about CNN’s debate setup last week. It’s yet another example of generative AI tools like ChatGPT being used to spread misinformation or propaganda.  Read more at NBC News.

New campaign ad ties Matt Gaetz to a convicted sex offender,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 2:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/matt-gaetz-florida-ad-greenberg-mccarthy-rcna159990,"A new political ad on Florida airwaves is targeting Rep. Matt Gaetz over his ties to a convicted sex offender. The ad — a boon for the Florida Republican’s primary challenger, Aaron Dimmock — might just be the latest chess move in Kevin McCarthy’s revenge tour, which has sought to oust the GOP lawmakers who voted to remove him as House speaker last year. The spot is funded by an organization called Florida Patriots PAC, which bears resemblance to similarly named PACs that were used to target other McCarthy foes during primary races in South Carolina and Virginia. The revenge tour sputtered out of the gate last month, as McCarthy’s pick in South Carolina failed to oust Rep. Nancy Mace in her primary. And in Virginia, a McCarthy-backed candidate is leading Rep. Bob Good in his primary, but only after former President Donald Trump bashed Good and also endorsed the challenger. Gaetz won his primary comfortably in 2022, so ousting him seems like an uphill climb. But the ad targeting him (which you can watch here) is cutting, without question. It highlights Gaetz’s “close friendship” with Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax official who pleaded guilty to several federal charges in 2021, including child sex trafficking. Gaetz once referred to Greenberg as his “wingman.” Greenberg cooperated with a federal sex trafficking probe into Gaetz that ultimately resulted in no charges being brought against the House Republican. Greenberg reportedly has cooperated with the House Ethics Committee’s probe into Gaetz as well. Two weeks ago, the committee said in a news release that it was reviewing allegations that the Florida representative may have “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.” McCarthy has argued that Gaetz fueled the effort to oust him after the then-speaker declined to interfere in the ethics probe. During an event at Georgetown University in April, McCarthy claimed that he was no longer speaker because “one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old, an ethics complaint that started before I ever became speaker. And that’s illegal, and I’m not going to get in the middle. Did he do it or not? I don’t know.” It was a clear reference to Gaetz, who has denied the allegation and any wrongdoing. And now this new ad is continuing to hit him on the same front."
Judge postpones Trump's sentencing hearing after Supreme Court immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 11:54 AM PDT / Updated July 2, 2024, 2:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-sentencing-delayed-hush-money-supreme-court-rcna159969,"A judge on Tuesday postponed Donald Trump’s sentencing in his New York hush money case as the former president seeks to have his conviction overturned following a Supreme Court ruling that granted him some immunity in a separate criminal case. In a letter on Tuesday afternoon, Judge Juan Merchan said he would resolve Trump's motion to set aside the verdict on Sept. 6 and postponed his sentencing, ""if such is still necessary,"" until Sept. 18. Trump's lawyers launched their effort to get the verdict tossed out just hours after the Supreme Court's Monday ruling, which said Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for some official acts in his federal election interference case in Washington. Trump’s lawyers argued on Monday that Manhattan prosecutors built their case in part based on evidence from Trump’s time in office, as The New York Times pointed out. Such evidence, they claimed, is therefore inadmissible. The Manhattan district attorney's office said Tuesday that it doesn't oppose a delay in sentencing while the court works through Trump's motion. Trump’s New York case was likely the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial before the November election. He had been due for sentencing on July 11, four days before he is expected to be nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. Instead, Merchan has now set up a scenario in which Trump's guilty verdict might be tossed just two months before the November election.  How the judge might rule on the defense's motion is unclear. Trump's hush money conviction is largely centered on acts that he took as a presidential candidate, not as president. The presumptive GOP nominee cheered the postponement of his sentencing hearing on Tuesday. In a post on Truth Social, he falsely declared it a “total exoneration."""
How the Supreme Court broke its own most important rule,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT / Updated July 2, 2024, 12:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-immunity-decision-john-roberts-rcna159884,"The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that former President Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for official acts made while president. This partial immunity decision — presidents do not enjoy absolute immunity for unofficial actions taken while in office — is a stunning example of institutional hubris and reckless judicial activism. Instead of deciding specifically whether special counsel Jack Smith’s election interference criminal indictment against Trump is negated by presidential immunity, the court acknowledged a broader purpose. As majority author Chief Judge John Roberts pontificated: “[W]e cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on the present exigencies.” In plain English, the court refused to answer the question at the heart of Trump’s indictment, instead returning the case to the district court for further wrangling and debate. That’s a far cry from Roberts’ statement in his Senate confirmation hearing comparing his role to that of an umpire calling balls and strikes. The point of Roberts’ analogy was that justices don’t make rules, they are simply arbiters. But in this case, the court ignored the time-tested principle of judicial restraint. Instead, the court expanded the case’s scope beyond what either party had proposed. On the other hand, we already knew this was likely going to be the outcome. When the court converted Trump’s motion for a stay into a petition for certiorari, the justices drafted an overly broad question to decide, writing: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” During the oral argument on April 25, Trump’s lawyer D. John Sauer acknowledged that the court had “expanded the question presented from what either of the parties submitted to discuss here.” This expansion directly led to the court’s inconclusive holding that a former president may be immune for some actions and not for others. In addition to prolonging the delay in Trump’s D.C. federal trial, the opinion now pushes the case back to Judge Tanya Chutkan. If the district court rules again that Trump is not immune, his lawyers will appeal again. And the seemingly endless loop of legal delays will continue. The court’s self-important drive to announce an all-encompassing principle was underscored by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh during oral argument.  The issue before the court was bigger than just one case, Alito intoned, because “whatever we decide is going to apply to all future presidents.” When Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben referred to the specific allegations of Trump’s case, Alito doubled down, saying, “As I said, this case will have effects that go far beyond this particular prosecution.” Gorsuch appeared to be coming from the same viewpoint, stating, “I’m not concerned about this case so much as future ones too.” And Kavanaugh, in dialogue with the Justice Department lawyer, said, “As you have indicated, this case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency for the future of the country, in my view.”  But deciding the scope of any potential presidential immunity in circumstances different from those alleged in Trump’s indictment was not part of this case. The court can and should be deciding constitutional questions using the specific facts presented to them. For example, in its 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling shutting down the Florida recount of votes and, practically, giving the presidential election to George Bush, the court wrote: “Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.” Earlier in Roberts’ tenure as chief justice, according to a Congressional Research Service 2014 report, the Supreme Court in a “host of recent cases” employed rules “to avoid having the Supreme Court issue broad rulings on the Constitution.” That report recounted Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein’s advice that “in deciding cases, judges should say no more than necessary to justify an outcome and leave as much as possible undecided.”   The court knows how to decide an appeal on narrow grounds, leaving further issues for a future case. Last month, the court in Chiaverini v. City of Napoleon, Ohio, upheld the legal validity of an arrestee’s Fourth Amendment constitutional claim, but Justice Elena Kagan wrote, “we leave for another day” how that rule would be applied at trial. It chose not to adhere to this principle in Trump’s case, to the detriment of both the law and American democracy. Not only did the majority sabotage the timely prosecution of Trump for his alleged role in attempting to stay in power after he lost the 2020 election, but it also revealed the court’s own sense of its self-importance."
The Supreme Court just gave Trump some very bad news,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 12:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/supreme-court-trump-backfire-january-6th-rcna159943,"There was very bad news for Donald Trump in Monday’s Supreme Court decision, and arguably even worse news for candidate Trump. That’s because Mike Pence is going to walk into a federal courtroom, raise his right hand, take an oath to tell the truth, and testify against Trump in this case in September for an evidentiary hearing. What Monday’s decision did was give Trump absolute immunity applying to one paragraph of the indictment. The rest of the indictment goes back to Judge Tanya Chutkan’s courtroom, where the Supreme Court has ordered her to have a hearing about the evidence in the case to determine whether Trump’s actions were “official acts,” meaning they may be protected by immunity, or not. That goes for everything in the case, except for one conversation that Trump had with the acting attorney general. In this hearing, basically there’ll be some briefs on each side. And then the judge will schedule a day and say, “OK, we start today, Mr. Smith. Who’s your first witness?” It’s exactly like a prosecution. Sometimes, pretrial, in the evidentiary process, prosecutors don’t want to turn over all their cards. But Jack Smith is going to have to turn over every single one of them. Because the Supreme Court has said to him, in effect, ""We need to see every single one of your cards."" So every witness he has, he’s going to bring them into that courtroom. They’re all going to be under oath and the defense is going to be able to cross-examine them. The defense probably won’t bring in any witnesses at all. So you’re going to see this incredible Jan. 6 hearing on steroids possibly for six to eight weeks in September to October. This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC's special coverage of the presidential immunity Supreme Court ruling on July 1."
"""Textual Backflips""",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-textual-backflips-rcna159998,"As the fallout from the momentous Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity continues to reverberate, MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord offer some updates, then turn to another significant ruling from the High Court out on Friday: Fisher v. U.S. At issue was whether the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding could be applied to Capitol rioters in the wake of their actions on January 6th. Despite the ruling in favor of the defendant, their guest Ryan Goodman of Just Security confirms the limited impact this decision will have on those charged for their role in the chaos of January 6th, and for Donald Trump’s election interference case in DC. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome back to Prosecuting Donald Trump. It’s Tuesday, July 2nd and I’m Andrew Weissman, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Mary McCord: Good morning, Andrew. Seems like I just was on with you. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, well, guess what? That’s because we were. Mary McCord: Oh, we were! Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, so this is going to be an episode where we talk to another NYU colleague, Ryan Goodman. And we’ll turn to that in a moment. I know that you just heard from us talking about the immunity decision. There are a couple of things we wanted to flag before we talk with Ryan about the case that came out. It feels like a year ago, but was just last week, which is the Fischer decision. But there are some things we wanted to flag in connection with the immunity decision. So, Mary, do you want to start us off on that? Mary McCord: Sure, because yesterday after we recorded, more things happened. Surprise, surprise. One of which is that Donald Trump, through his attorneys, sent a letter to Judge Merchan, that is the judge in the Manhattan trial for which he was found guilty a month ago, I don’t know, time is impossible now, of multiple felonies related to his payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels to keep her from talking about things that would have affected the election back in 2016. So as we await his sentencing, which is scheduled for next week, July 11th, as soon as this immunity decision came out, Mr. Trump’s attorney sent a letter to Judge Merchan asking permission to file a motion to set aside the verdict on the grounds that he is immune from that prosecution. Now, again, we have not seen this letter. This was reported by the “New York Times,” and we have not seen the substantive motion yet. Right now he’s saying, put off my sentencing. Let me file a motion to set aside these verdicts because I can’t be prosecuted because I’m immune. Now, Andrew, I don’t know about you, but if my recollection of us covering that trial every single day by reading the transcripts, or you in many cases going to it and us discussing it on the podcast twice a week, my recollection is that the payments to Stormy Daniels occurred before Mr. Trump was in the White House, and it’s kind of hard to imagine how reimbursement for those payments could be official acts. But what do you think? Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I think that if you’re the defense lawyer, you’re going to make this motion. Mary McCord: Of course. Andrew Weissmann: You should. You know, if there’s a 1% chance, you make it. There’s no question that the conduct at issue is unofficial. Yes, there is conduct that occurred while Donald Trump was president. There’s conduct that occurred before he was president that forms the basis of the scheme that was charged and for which he was convicted. But there was conduct while he was president, for instance, the reimbursements. Mary McCord: The signing of the checks. Andrew Weissmann: Many of those were signed in the Oval Office. But obviously, that reimbursement of payments to Stormy Daniels is the most quintessential personal material. However, this is where the Supreme Court immunity decision is particularly egregious because there’s a 5-4 split, not 6-3, 5-4 split on once something is considered an official act, it cannot be used, according to the majority in court and -- Mary McCord: As evidence. Andrew Weissmann: As evidence. And so the argument is going to be made that certain tweets, certain testimony about things that Donald Trump did while he was president constitute official acts and so that should be kept out. Mary McCord: So let’s break that down for a second, though, to make sure. So the case was about the payment, creating false business records to cover up these payments. The payments, of course, to Stormy Daniels were made before Mr. Trump was president. But as you just indicated, at trial, there was also evidence elicited that Mr. Trump signed checks reimbursing Michael Cohen, remember, falsely claiming this was for legal services by paying monthly payments over the course of basically his first year as president. So this means that evidence came in of things he did while he was in the Oval Office doesn’t necessarily mean those are official acts because just being in the Oval Office doesn’t make him an official act. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: So there will be an argument about that. But then there were other things that happened that came into evidence while he was president, including, as you just indicated, some of his social media posts kind of talking about this, right. Again, I think most of us would be like, you’re talking about a personal thing, not official act. But there’s something we’re in analysis his attorneys will argue has to happen. And then there was Hope Hicks, for example, as well as Madeleine. Help me out here, Wester -- Andrew Weissmann: Westerhout. Mary McCord: Westerhout. Andrew Weissmann: Westerhout. Mary McCord: Yes, who worked in the White House, who also testified about what they knew of this issue that I’m sure his attorneys will argue those are official acts. So before we get to the point of none of that can be admitted into evidence, we’ve got to determine if those are even official acts, right? Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. As well as so much of that, I think, will be viewed as not official. Second, even if it’s viewed as official, for instance, sending out a tweet, they’ll say, well, that’s part of my official acts is being president, is communicating with the citizenry that if it’s public and in the public domain, the idea that you can’t use it. And that’s actually even flagged in a footnote as something that should be allowed. Mary McCord: By the chief -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. Mary McCord: -- by the chief justice who wrote the majority opinion. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Because it’s like, how could that possibly in any way affect the functioning of the presidency in any sort of meaningful way? So, again, there’ll be arguments on this. The third issue is that the whole issue of immunity, there’s a really good argument that it was waived, that both the trial judge, Judge Merchan, but also when Donald Trump was trying to remove this case to federal court, the federal judge who handled the case said that the issue was waived. So then finally, by the way, even if Donald Trump were to win all of this, that it’s official, it should be kept out, it wasn’t waived, it also then has to be material. Meaning if you keep out something that is a grain of sand on the beach, the judge can say this wouldn’t have changed the result in any way. You’re entitled to a constitutionally valid trial. You’re not entitled to a perfect trial. And sometimes evidence is let in that shouldn’t have been, but it has to be material. Mary McCord: Right. That’s called harmless air, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. There can’t be something that’s just so extraneous that you say it has an effect on the result and the judge can say, no, it’s too minor. So there are lots and lots of arguments. We’re really just flagging the issue. Some of the things that Mary, you and I are talking about, we’ll wait and see sort of how it gets -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- played out. I have to say, I don’t fault the defense for raising it. I mean, it was kind of like a gift given to them by the majority that was shocking, given that Chief Justice Roberts in the oral argument of the immunity case was on the side of Amy Coney Barrett, that this should be allowed into evidence, that they sort of, as we talked about yesterday, that he really flipped. And so I understand why the defense is making this argument, but this is one of the, you know, I’d love to say unintended consequences, but I think I’m going to say intended consequences -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- is that you have this motion now. Mary McCord: Yeah. So the other thing that we wanted to flag is not something actually new that developed after our podcast yesterday, but something we just didn’t get a chance to talk about. And that was the Thomas concurrence. So Justice Thomas, not surprisingly, agreed with the majority in terms of their substantive ruling about immunity. But he wrote separately, and it’s fairly short, to say essentially that he also thinks that Jack Smith was not constitutionally appointed. And this is the argument that we have talked about recently when we’ve talked about some of the motions to dismiss pending before Judge Cannon. In fact, the motion that was argued, I guess, a week ago Friday, if I’m getting my dates right, where Mr. Trump and his attorneys had argued that Jack Smith was not constitutionally appointed under the appointments clause. And they also made a separate argument that he wasn’t funded appropriately under the appropriations clause. Justice Thomas here, somewhat gratuitously, in my opinion, because, of course, this was not at all part of the briefing or argument or question presented or question accepted by the completely separate. Yes? Andrew Weissmann: Mary, could we take out the word somewhat? Mary McCord: Yeah. Okay, because yes, because as you can tell, I’m being triggered here. I’m on trigger avenue. Let’s write about something totally not briefed. Yes. You know, it says, look, the appointments clause says that appointments have to be provided for either in the Constitution or be established by law appointments for people with the kind of authority that he thinks Jack Smith has. He says it’s difficult to see how the special counsel has an office established by law as required by the Constitution. And if Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the executive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fill that office. Given that the special counsel purports to wield the executive branch’s power to prosecute, the consequences are weighty. So he weighs in on something completely different to say Jack Smith’s appointment is unconstitutional. And in my opinion, this is almost like trying to lay a road map for Judge Cannon, who still has this motion pending before her. I kind of hate saying that, actually, but I doubt she’s listening to our podcast. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, notably what he’s put out there and in this gratuitous fashion. And by the way, you’re really supposed to address issues that are presented, not these other issues that are not brief. That’s just a straightforward proposition that all courts are supposed to follow. But what he’s saying would actually apply to other special counsels. So right now, David Weiss is a special counsel who is prosecuting Hunter Biden, I didn’t see that. Mary McCord: No, I didn’t see that in here. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, can you tell me, did you see Justice Thomas talk about how David Weiss shouldn’t be appointed? Yeah. Mary McCord: No. I’m looking. I’m scanning. I’m skimming. I’m scanning. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: I’m not seeing it. Andrew Weissmann: You’re not seeing any reference to that? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: What about Rob Hur? Did you see a reference to Rob Hur with that? Mary McCord: Not seeing that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, you know. Mary McCord: And I should say, I mean, just to correct myself, he doesn’t say is unconstitutional. He says there are serious questions whether the attorney general has violated the constitutional structure by creating this office. So I’m sure that’s the wiggle room he’s leaving for some of those other special counsels. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, that’s great. Mary, let’s preview. We’re about to have Ryan Goodman come on to talk to us about the Fischer case that happened a year ago, which means Friday. Mary McCord: Friday. Andrew Weissmann: So, can you remind us what the Fischer case is, and then we’ll get more into a deep dive with Ryan. Mary McCord: Sure. Fischer is one of the thousands of folks who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, more than 1,400 of whom have been prosecuted. He was -- Andrew Weissmann: Alleged. Alleged. Mary McCord: Alleged. Alleged. Andrew Weissmann: Because he hasn’t gone to trial yet. Mary McCord: That’s right. He has not. He was charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, as well as many other offenses, including assaulting law enforcement officers. He’s not yet been to trial. He challenged the government’s use of that obstruction charged against him. That is the issue that went up to the Supreme Court. That is the issue that the Supreme Court decided on Friday. It obviously has implications for other cases of the rioters and how they’ve been charged. It has implications, although I think almost none for Mr. Trump. And we’re going to dive into all of that after the break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, we are very pleased to have join us today, Ryan Goodman. Ryan is the founding co-editor-in-chief of Just Security. He is a law professor and co-director of the Reese Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law. You’ll see a theme here. Two days in a row, two NYU professors joining us. And he served as special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense from 2015 to 2016. So good to have you here with us this morning, Ryan. Ryan Goodman: Thanks so much for the invitation to be here with you guys. Andrew Weissmann: So Ryan and I teach national security law at NYU. And Ryan, I thought maybe -- Mary McCord: And I’ve actually guest taught with you, so there you go. Andrew Weissmann: Every year. Mary McCord: We just get the band back together. Andrew Weissmann: And I think I’ve told this story, but it hasn’t been told in a long time. And since we’re at the point where I only have so many anecdotes, even at my age. But when Mary teaches, my favorite student reaction was the week after Mary came and taught, a student came up to me and said, you know, I figured out what I want to do with the rest of my life. And I was like, okay, that’s pretty impressive. I mean, you know, this is a law student. So they’re really just beginning in their career. And I said, so what? What are you thinking of? And she said, I decided I want to be Mary McCord. Mary McCord: No, she doesn’t. Very flattering, but no. Andrew Weissmann: So Ryan, I thought maybe the first thing is one of the things that Mary said when she was introducing you was to talk about your being the co-editor in chief at something called Just Security. And we’re going to be talking about a piece that you were the primary author that I will say Mary and I -- Mary McCord: Kind of hung on, yeah, right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and yeah, we flagged minor issues, but it was your brainchild. But before we do that, do you want to just talk about what exactly is Just Security? And even though we’ll in the show notes have a link to the particular article that we’re going to talk about, there’s so much more on Just Security. So I thought maybe we’d first just talk about what is it? Ryan Goodman: Thanks so much and also thank you for being equal partners on our joint project. But so Just Security is an online forum, like a publication or magazine that one might think of that’s just purely online based here at NYU School of Law. And it primarily brings top level legal experts, but also policy experts to address issues at the intersection of security, rights, democracy, rule of law. And I think one of the things that we do, we do multiple things, but one of the things that we do quite well is by having those experts weigh in on tippy top pressing issues and to be able to do it at a rapid reaction. And then otherwise deep dives and highly researched pieces like the one we’ll be discussing today that is able to parse data in the ways that scholars and experts generally do. Andrew Weissmann: So the other thing I note that you do, Ryan, is that Just Security has a podcast. So we’ll plug that on our podcast. It’s really terrific. And it’s a very good companion piece to the articles that you put out. And it’s a different forum and format to be able to access them. So, Ryan, tell us what you were thinking of when you had the idea of doing this piece, because a lot of the work was while the Fischer case was pending, sort of how you saw the piece and how it related to the Fischer arguments and what you were trying to accomplish. Ryan Goodman: Sure. So tracking very closely all of the Department of Justice’s January 6 cases, of which there were over 1,400 individuals charged, the one issue that came all the way to the Supreme Court is this issue of whether or not individuals could be charged in a particular obstruction statute. And a lot seemed to hang in the balance, because at one point it even seemed to be the modal category, the number one charge that was being brought that individuals had engaged in obstructing the congressional proceedings. So it seems very high stakes. And that was the general understanding, I think, of most experts, myself included, I should even put it that way, when this came to the Supreme Court. So if the Supreme Court invalidated the Justice Department’s use of the statute and the ways in which they had employed it in these cases, it looked like a large portion of all of the Justice Department’s work could go away. And the question in my mind was, what would the reaction to that be? Because you could see the train coming. That seemed to be the direction the Supreme Court was going to take. And what would be the reaction? How might that feed into a lot of disinformation? And what could we anticipate ahead of time to preempt and ward off that disinformation? Like the way in which you could easily imagine something like that coming out of the Supreme Court could be deployed in a disinformation environment to make big arguments about, oh, see that? There’s the weaponization of the Department of Justice. See that? It’s all over-criminalization of politics. They’ve used a statute that’s completely invalid. It’s overreach. And so it was based on that that I thought, let’s do a deep dive into the project to see really how the department has used the statute. How many cases does this really affect and the like? Mary McCord: So before we get into that analysis, let’s make sure all listeners are understanding what statute we’re talking about. This is a statute that is, the actual citation to it is 18 United States Code §1512(c). And it has two parts, a part 1, (c)1, and a part 2, (c)2. Under (c)1, it is unlawful to alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record, document, or other object with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding. That is not the statute that the Department of Justice charged in most of these cases against those who attacked the Capitol on January 6. (c)2, however, prohibits otherwise, and that is a quote, otherwise obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding. So the government’s theory was that by violently attacking the Capitol and prohibiting Congress through that attack from engaging in the joint session on January 6, as required by law to count the Electoral College votes, those attackers were otherwise obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding. So that’s the issue that went to the Supreme Court. 14 out of 15 district court judges appointed by presidents, both Republican and Democratic, had said, yes, that otherwise clause, (c)2, applies to this type of conduct. One judge had said, no, I feel like because of (c)1, it needs to have something to do with impairing the integrity or availability of some sort of evidence. That’s the issue. And I should also say in the D.C. Circuit, the D.C. Circuit panel, a three-judge panel, agreed with the 14 judges and not with the one that this statute could apply to the conduct of the rioters with one dissenter. That’s the issue went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ended up ruling in a six-to-three decision, but the six-to-three is not the ideological split we’ve become accustomed to. We can talk about that. The (c)2 is informed by (c)1, so it’s not otherwise meaning in every other means possible, but that it has to be tethered to (c)1. However, it gave an expansive, to our minds, I think, Ryan and Andrew, an expansive reading of (c)2, saying that it encompasses more than obviously just altering a document record or other object, because that’s in (c)1, but it encompasses creating false evidence as well as impairing the availability or integrity of other things used in an official proceeding, and this is important, beyond records, documents or other objects, including witness testimony or intangible information. So that’s where we are on the law. Andrew Weissmann: So what’s really interesting about that is it was quite expansive in terms of, well, it does tether it (c)2 to (c)1. It basically says anything having to do with evidence. And evidence can be tangible, it can be intangible, it can be documents, it can be witnesses. Mary McCord: It can be information. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Now, what it doesn’t include is if you are just attacking the Capitol to obstruct the proceeding, but you’re not in any way, there’s no intent to affect information going to the proceeding. You’re not trying to destroy documents, alter the testimony of somebody, keep information from somebody. In other words, that’s not part of your intent or even effect. That would be carved out. But there is this ability within a fairly, I thought, expansive view. In other words, it could have been worse, is what I would say. Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: The other thing I just wanted to say about the 14 to 1, which I’m going to ask Ryan about that, but the interesting thing about the 14 to 1 at the district court level with 14 judges saying that the government was right and one judge saying, no, I think (c)2 should be cabined more closely to (c)1, is that three of the 14 judges were nominated by Donald Trump. So especially since we’ve talked so much about Judge Cannon and who appoints who, this is a case where, as you said, Mary, it’s not just Republican and Democratic, but even judges who are appointed by Donald Trump looked at this and said, this is a permissible use. And I think that just goes a long way, that hard data goes a long way to dispel this idea that this is the Department of Justice doing something novel that was politically motivated and outside the box, because you really don’t have that just in terms of how the district courts ruled on this. Ryan Goodman: Right. And just to add in a couple other data points on that, in addition to the three Trump appointed judges at the district level, there’s also a Reagan and George W. Bush appointees in the 14. And something that I have not seen remarked on publicly, when we’re talking about the question of was this a political use of the statute, what people miss is it is not the Biden Justice Department that is first to use the statute in this way. It is the Trump Justice Department before January 20th, 2021. The first charges that they bring include the very statute used for these kinds of conduct. So it’s actually it crosses over both administrations as well. Mary McCord: And that’s right, because people, I think, sometimes forget, right, January 6th obviously happened two weeks, almost two weeks before the inauguration and then transition. And there were multiple cases brought quickly in those couple of weeks. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, that’s what happens when you commit crimes in front of law enforcement, you would think. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, Ryan, turning back to the project in terms of you were saying that you wanted to sort of do this deep dive to sort of test out what would the effects be. So tell us what you did and what your statistics found and sort of how you, to use the crazy word, bucketized the groups. Ryan Goodman: Yeah. So NPR has a database of all of the January 6th defendants and they track it very closely. They update it every week. So that includes what are individuals charged for? What have they been convicted of? Did they plead guilty? Did they plead guilty to which charges? So we were already in conversation with NPR about their database, which we’re using for another big project. And along came the Supreme Court oral argument and then the decision was about to be handed down. And we went into the NPR database, thanks to their extraordinarily diligent work, to collect all of the cases that have been used for this charge. And it started to produce a very dramatic effect. So basically the idea is that the invalidation of this particular use of the statute for capital rioters does not affect that many cases. It’s actually very small. The way that the mainstream media had been covering it before the Supreme Court’s opinion is to say there are a huge number of cases, basically 350 people have been charged with this crime. Andrew Weissmann: So that’s about a quarter of the people. Ryan Goodman: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Ryan Goodman: So that’s a quarter. That’s a sizable number of the January 6th defendants. Well, what that misses is, for example, individuals that are not affected whatsoever by the Supreme Court opinion. A good quarter of that quarter are individuals who, yes, they were charged for this obstruction statute, 1512 (c)2, but they pled to other crimes and not to the 1512 (c)2. Mary McCord: Right. Ryan Goodman: So their sentences, their pleadings, everything remains completely intact. That’s one part of it. That already whittles it down quite a lot. The other part is -- Mary McCord: And we should also remind people, I mean, we said a quarter, but let’s just put the big number out there, right? More than 1400 people have been charged. So when we’re at 350 a quarter, I mean, that’s already a huge number of people who were never even charged. Now you’re saying about a quarter of that quarter pled guilty to something else, has been sentenced, no impact. Andrew Weissmann: Three quarters for whom this is just entirely irrelevant because there’s not a 1512 (c)2 charge. Then of the 340 or so, a quarter of that, they pled to something completely unrelated. Ryan Goodman: Correct. So they’re completely unaffected. And then the next question is how many people are still materially unaffected? So there’s a majority of the individuals charged with this crime. If they were convicted, either based on a plea deal or by trial, super majority of them were convicted for other felonies as well. So there’s other felonies stay. And then thanks to y’all’s analysis from the vast experience that the two of you have, we also then analyze the database to show and to make the point that in the recharging of these individuals, so it might now go back for recharging, the judges can still use the underlying bad conduct, even though it’s no longer charged, because that would still be a legitimate part of the sentencing guidelines for the judges to determine what the sentence should be. So other ways in which it still remains highly relevant, the conduct of entering the Capitol to interrupt the certification of the election by Congress. Mary McCord: And could I just interject there? Because one of the things that people, a lot of people talk about is, oh, this offense carries a 20 year penalty. So even if you’re convicted of other felonies, this was the big one with 20 years. For the most part, people have not been getting sentenced to things like 20 years. I mean, most of the double digit sentences have involved people like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, which also carries a 20 year sentence. And a few others who had very violent assaults on police officers, for example, got double digit sentences. But to this point about those who may need to be resentenced, and the judges can still take into consideration the conduct underlying the obstruction offense, in many cases, their sentences, I suspect, will end up being the same as what they were because they weren’t getting 20 years. They were getting something less than that and something well within the maximum for the felonies for which they were convicted. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. One sort of pointer for our listeners is it’s so annoying, I think, for prosecutors and defense lawyers when the media and others just immediately jump to the maximum sentence. And a lot of times when you hear about somebody who’s been charged with something, the media says, and they could face 120 years in jail -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- because there’s six charges and each of them carries a 20 year maximum. And Mary and I both go, are you freaking kidding me? I mean, that’s absurd because there are guidelines and no judge is thinking 120 years. Just because there’s a maximum, you could cover that just as much if you want to cover the minimum. And so it’s just not in any way predictive of what the person is likely to get. And just the other point, just to underscore something you said, Mary, which is the people who’ve gotten high sentences have been charged with things like seditious conspiracy or assaulting an actual police officer. So the 1512(c)2 is not the charge that’s doing the work in terms of the sentencing. But Ryan, I think you look like there’s something you wanted to say, and then we thought we’d take a quick break and we have a lot more questions to ask you about the piece. Ryan Goodman: Sure. Just to piggyback on something that you just said, Andrew, which is just take Joseph Fischer himself, the lead plaintiff in the case. So he has not yet gone to trial. This was a pre-trial motion. It is possible that the obstruction statute now cannot be charged against him. We can discuss whether or not it actually still. Mary McCord: We’ll come back to that, yes. Ryan Goodman: Yes. But he, like the other two defendants that were consolidated in this case, all three of them have other felonies. Those felonies include assaulting law enforcement officers. So their fate as to whether or not they’re going to serve time in jail may be unaffected by the Supreme Court ruling, even though the Supreme Court ruling is in their favor. Andrew Weissmann: So why don’t we take a quick break and then let’s come back to this issue of whether Mr. Fischer could still be charged with the obstruction charge, the (c)2 charge because I think it also allows to talk a little bit about the split in the Supreme Court and Ketanji Brown-Jackson and where she ended up and -- Mary McCord: And Amy Coney Barrett and where she ended up. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Because she is such an interesting character, but this is the tease. Mary McCord: Yes. We’re going over the cliff. Okay. Let’s leave it hanging on the cliff. Okay. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Welcome back, Ryan. Why don’t we talk about under what circumstances do you think that Mr. Fischer could still be charged with an obstruction charge under (c)2 that’ll take us into some of the opinions. Ryan Goodman: So the roadmap is laid out by Ketanji Brown-Jackson’s concurring opinion. And the justice at the very end of her opinion, the very final passage, basically says there’s still a path here for the Justice Department to charge Mr. Fischer under the very same statute. You just have to apply the framework. And then the question is, as Mary had set out at the beginning, under the new test, did Mr. Fischer act with the intent to impair, let’s say, the availability of records, their proper certificates, or trying to facilitate the false certificates? But in this instance, I think it would be interrupting the electoral certificates from being used in the congressional proceedings. They very well might have the case against him, and that would be the charge. And just to add a little bit more to that, the reporting in the 24 hours since the Supreme Court opinion by CNN, New York Times, and others indicates that the Justice Department is poised to make these kinds of moves. Not necessarily Mr. Fischer’s case, though they might have that as well, but CNN, for example, said that in multiple cases, the Justice Department has provided evidence to the jury that shows the ways in which the clerks of Congress had to run with the certificates out of the building because of the incoming rioters. That provides you the kind of theory of the case that would fit the legal framework that the court just articulated. Mary McCord: And certificates, just to be sure everyone’s checking, this was the day that Congress, the joint session, was going to literally count the electoral ballots. And those are transmitted by the states with all of the electors in each state signing and a certification that these are valid. Now, of course, we know there were also several states that sent up false certificates. That’s not the point of this particular charge here. That has been the point of separate charges and separate cases. But those certificates is something that was a document that needed to be counted, opened by, I should say, envelopes opened by the vice president and counted on that day. And those were very much impaired by the riot. The other thing that I think is significant, you said concurrence, but just to be sure everyone’s clear, Justice Jackson’s concurrence was written separately because she agreed with the conclusion of the majority, again, a 6-3. She was one of the six who said that (c)2 does have to be tethered to (c)1 and it has to involve impairment of integrity or availability of something to be used in an official proceeding. So she wrote separately. It’s not like a dissent writing separately and people can sort of write that off as, oh, well, that’s a dissent. This was a concurrence. And this is saying, here’s how I, who agree with the majority, see this playing out. And she says quite clearly, and these are her words, it might well be that Fischer’s conduct, as alleged here, involved the impairment or the attempted impairment of the availability or integrity of things used during the January 6 proceeding in ways other than those specified in (c)1, and if so, his prosecution can and should proceed. This remains available for the lower courts to determine on remand. So I think that’s really important. Andrew Weissmann: Can I just say why there’s sort of an elephant in the room here? Because I think what she, although she addresses the Fischer case, and this is very factual, both what she’s saying and our earlier discussion about the broad definition of evidence that the court in the majority gives to (c)2, the looming issue is Donald Trump and his case. And maybe I can pose this to Ryan, how do you think this decision affects the (c)2 charge and the conspiracy (c)2 charge? Because these are charges that Donald Trump faces. We’ll leave aside the immunity decision, which we talked about yesterday with our colleague Trevor Morrison. But how do you think this decision affects the Trump case? Is it go forward on the sort of the Ketanji-Brown-Jackson theory, or is there some nuance that we’re missing? Ryan Goodman: So I think that the Jack Smith case goes forward without any real risk from Fischer. And that’s because the theory of the case for Donald Trump is the false slate of electors that he helped orchestrate across the seven different states, false documents or forgeries, as it has been charged in some of those states, to be submitted to Congress. And that is fully consistent with the majority opinion, as well as Justice Jackson’s opinion. The majority, I think, almost goes out of its way to give as an example, quote unquote, false evidence. Creating, yes, that’s a good point. Creating false evidence that fits like nearly like a hand in glove with the false certifications. And that’s obviously a record or a document. It’s such an easy application of the majority opinion, almost of (c)1, except it goes beyond it to include falsified documents. And so I don’t think Jack Smith should lose any sleep over it. Mary McCord: If it weren’t for the immunity opinion, but that’s another story. Ryan Goodman: Yes. Yeah, but would not lose any sleep over Fischer. Though, that said, it’ll introduce motions. It would be incumbent upon Trump’s attorneys to make the argument in the immunity opinion. They drop an early footnote that basically invites it as well as a possibility. But I can’t imagine as long as every one of the judges sticks to the majority opinion, let’s say, that it would trouble the theory of the case of the charges against Trump or I should say, and others. Mary McCord: Yes. Ryan Goodman: So if any others were ever tried at the federal level, including the co-conspirators, the unindicted co-conspirators in the federal indictment, they too, for the involvement in the false electors scheme, I think it would clearly apply to them. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, you mentioned that while this opinion is 6-3, at the outset, you noted that it is not the six and the three that one would expect because Ketanji Brown-Jackson, who is usually viewed as a, quote, unquote, “liberal justice,” joins the majority. She does write, as you said, separately. But the dissent, which is three justices, the dissent is written by Amy Coney Barrett. It’s not that she doesn’t just join it. She actually writes it. And the one thing I will say, I think I’ve said this before, is I find her in this term, you may disagree with her on lots of things, but she comes off as thoughtful and honest and also a beautiful writer. I think I may have mentioned this just on yesterday’s episode. Mary McCord: You mentioned it yesterday, right. Andrew Weissmann: And you know what? I still have the same view, which is surprising that it’s 24 hours later and I haven’t changed my mind. But I wanted to get your take on sort of what she said, what her criticism of the majority is, and what you sort of made of the fact that she was in dissent here. Mary McCord: Well, she is very pointed in her dissent. She says that, you know, the majority doesn’t dispute that the joint session qualifies as an official proceeding, that rioters delayed that proceeding, or even that Fischer’s alleged conduct was part of a successful effort to forcibly halt the certification of the election results. And she says, given all of that, the case that he can be tried for obstructing an official proceeding, and this is a quote, “seems open and shut.” So why does the court hold otherwise? She then says the court abandoning its normal approach to statutory interpretation does textual backflips, those are her words, to find some way, any way to narrow the reach of subsection (c)2. And she dissents. And then she basically says, look, the government’s interpretation is very straightforward. Otherwise means otherwise. The plain language means in a way other than the way in (c)1, and that way should not be limited by (c)1. Now, the majority had used these statutory interpretation canons that I would say don’t really apply here because the language is clear, which is when you have a list of things and there’s an otherwise clause at the end, sometimes that otherwise clause means, well, it does have to be tethered to that list of things. But usually in those cases, the list is one list. So let’s say -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- (c)1 itself said altering, mutilating, etcetera, a document or otherwise. In one clause, I would agree maybe with the majority, but it didn’t. It is two separate sections, (c)1 and (c)2. Andrew Weissmann: And she use great examples of that. She really takes them to task and goes through all of the textual analysis to point out why it just does not hold. Mary McCord: Yep. So I think it’s important reading because, you know, again, we’re starting to get a feel for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, just like we did in yesterday’s immunity decision, where I thought, you know, that was a partial concurrence and a partial dissent. And she dissented on some very important points. And even on the part with which she concurred, she would have gone farther. She made it clear she would have then applied what the majority was coming up with as its test about deciding what’s official and what is unofficial. And she made it very clear that the false elector scheme in her mind is clearly on the -- Andrew Weissmann: Unofficial. Mary McCord: -- unofficial side of the line. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Right. So, you know, like you said, Andrew, I think, you know, I’m really impressed with some of the things she’s doing, even when I substantively might disagree, because I think she’s clear about how she approaches sort of from a legal perspective issues and, you know, providing more guidance, frankly, than the majority. But anyway, I digress to immunity at this point. Andrew Weissmann: Ryan. Yeah, what do you think? Ryan Goodman: Just want to jump in with further laudatory words about Amy Coney Barrett’s work in these cases. In the oral arguments, I thought she played one of those pivotal roles. Mary McCord: Yes. Ryan Goodman: So in the immunity case, she is the one who gets Trump’s attorney to essentially concede that a list of allegations, including the false elector scheme, is on the private side of the line, not on the official conduct side of the line. It’s even a notable moment in the oral argument where I thought I detected Elena Kagan is asking the next question and is even taken by surprise that Amy Coney Barrett had asked Elena’s question, so that it’s a powerful, pivotal moment for how everybody even thinks of the case. Then in the Fischer case, she’s the one that takes the lead in the oral argument about asking the question as to whether or not the statute would apply to conduct that is acting upon the certificates themselves. So -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Ryan Goodman: -- it’s not just in the writing of these opinions, but also I think as an active justice in the oral arguments, she’s become something quite impressive. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, I mean, it is something worth keeping an eye on. I think it’s too soon to say that she’s going to be the new justice suitor. But you do get the sense that she is, and again, I won’t go to say that’s definitive, but you get the sense that she is honestly wrestling with issues. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Again, you may disagree with where she comes out, but when you compare her to what I think is just thoroughly disingenuous outcome driven, you know, justices on the Supreme Court, she is not exhibiting any of that behavior. Mary McCord: So bottom line is Fischer, not so much impact, very little impact. One of the things we didn’t mention that is part of the article, Ryan, that I thought was so great that you dug up is that even in cases where defendants in the January 6th attack had pleaded guilty solely to a 1512(c)2 offense, the government had included a clause in that plea agreement that said, essentially, if that charge is ever vacated, they can actually re-bring one of the offenses that they dismissed as part of the plea agreement. So even in those cases where people pled guilty only to this, there’s still a potential remedy here. So, you know, I think at the end of the day, the impact is going to be very, very minimal. And that’s particularly the case if the government does go ahead, particularly for those who have not yet gone to trial or pleaded guilty and pursues these charges on, you know, consistent with the majority opinion. Ryan Goodman: Yes. And I think it also the punchline in terms of the bottom line is the number 5.9 percent. So only in 5.9 percent of all January 6th cases are those individuals materially benefited from the Fischer opinion. Those are the individuals for which the only backup appears to be a misdemeanor charge. And I would think in those cases, those are the ones that we’re the least troubled about. Mary McCord: That’s right. Absolutely. Ryan Goodman: They’re not the seditious conspiracy by the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys and all the folks who are attacking law enforcement officers and the like. These are the cases that I think on the outer edge on the margin. And those are the 6 percent that are affected. Andrew Weissmann: So one thing I think that 5.9 percent figure is really useful to understand that sort of seems to be the maximum of the number of people who might only face a misdemeanor now, not a felony. But I think it’s zero percent who actually, as a result of this decision, don’t face anything. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: In other words, I don’t think there’s anybody who doesn’t face any crime because of this decision. In other words, this sort of idea that, oh, wait a second, everyone goes free. Ryan Goodman: Right. Andrew Weissmann: I think the answer is no, because there’s nobody who isn’t facing either a felony, some other felony or a misdemeanor or might still even be able to be charged with the 1512(c)2 charge that everybody falls into some charge. But there is a bucket of people who might get sort of a sentencing reduction or only have a misdemeanor. But it’s a much smaller group than the sort of widely touted beforehand that this would be as some devastating loss for the government in terms of hundreds of people going free. Ryan Goodman: Right. And also not only the devastating loss, but it counteracts the disinformation or misinformation about government overreach, because the whole point is that it’s actually such a teeny, tiny, small percentage of the cases that are actually materially affected. Mary McCord: Ryan, it’s been so great having you join us. You also have such a calming voice. You know, Andrew and I just get each other like riled up faster and faster and faster. Triggered. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, I’m a really bad influence on Mary. Ryan Goodman is, you know, when you think, when people say, oh, that’s academic and sometimes people view that as a negative, Ryan Goodman is the platonic ideal of what you want somebody in the academy to be, which is completely dispassionate about facts and letting the facts govern how you should think about something. And this piece, which is said is in our show notes, is such a great example of that. And then being really thorough and there’s a deep dive. And just final word is that I know we went over a lot of numbers, but in the piece there actually are some pie charts said that there is -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: You don’t have to just do the math. There are some easy visuals so that you can sort of see what Ryan was talking about. And I think we’re all really indebted to you and to Just Security for doing this deep dive. Ryan Goodman: Well, thank you so much. And I did actually want to do a little bit of a shout out to my colleague Pooja Shah for creating the pie charts and the information graphics, because I think they’re so important for people’s understanding. But then to also say, to requit some of what you both said, all your listeners know this, but you both are national treasures and it’s just really a pleasure and a privilege to be in this conversation with you. Andrew Weissmann: Well, Ryan, that’s very nice of you to say. Mary McCord: Appreciate you, Ryan. Andrew Weissmann: Ryan, thanks so much. Ryan Goodman: Thank you.
