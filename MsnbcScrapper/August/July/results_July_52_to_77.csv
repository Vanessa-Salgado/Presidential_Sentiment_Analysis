Biden’s bid for term limits on the Supreme Court faces some tricky obstacles,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 1:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-supreme-court-term-limits-reforms-rcna164073,"Among President Joe Biden’s three proposed Supreme Court reforms is term limits for justices. Biden wrote that he supports a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in “active service” on the court. The other two measures he mentioned are a constitutional amendment removing criminal immunity for presidents and legislation for an enforceable Supreme Court ethics code. The president’s Washington Post op-ed and White House fact sheet Monday are more ambiguous about the mechanism for term limits — that is, whether they’d come by legislation or amendment. As precedent for judicial term limits, both his op-ed and fact sheet cite presidential term limits, which were achieved by constitutional amendment.  The amendment vs. legislation distinction matters because any term-limit legislation that passes could be challenged on the rationale that the Constitution provides life tenure for justices. Not that such a challenge would necessarily succeed, and that’s why legislation might not kick justices off the court exactly but rather adjust their duties so that they’re still judges under the Constitution. Biden’s reference to 18 years of “active service” may be an acknowledgment of that consideration. So while any reforms are currently hypothetical with congressional Republicans opposing them, the success of term-limits legislation depends on its details (ethics code legislation would likewise face scrutiny from not only this Congress but also this Supreme Court, which jealously guards its power). Given the potential constitutional hurdles and constraints, a term-limit amendment could provide more flexibility to bring the court in line with other major constitutional democracies where justices don’t serve for life. On that note, Biden is correct to point out Monday that term limits would, among other things, “reduce the chance that any single presidency radically alters the makeup of the court for generations to come.” And like with the immunity amendment proposal, there’s value in keeping the court in the national conversation among the three branches of government. But when it comes to implementing term limits, the details and mechanism by which that reform is attempted will matter.

Excitement over Kamala Harris dims GOP's post-convention glow,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 12:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/harris-trump-enthusiasm-battleground-2024-rcna164057,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""Morning Joe."" President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race completely shook up what should have been the Republican Party’s post-convention glow. While Donald Trump did see a polling bump, as you would expect following a party’s convention, that wasn’t the story making headlines last week. No one was talking about what was discussed at the Republican National Convention.  Instead, the national conversation quickly moved past the convention and the focus shifted to the future: Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy.  Last week, for the first installment of Morning Joe’s 2024 presidential election focus groups, we visited the purple state of Wisconsin, where less than 30,000 votes determined the winner of around a dozen elections since 2000.  Campaigns use focus groups to test candidates, policy positions, and political messages. Focus groups are crucial because in order to win elections, you have to understand the voters. During my conversations, I noticed how different the energy was among voters last week, compared to when I was in Wisconsin just six weeks earlier.   Six weeks ago, Democratic voters were depressed. Now they’re energized. They might have some qualms about Harris, and she may not have been their first choice — but she is now. Democrats are in and they’re activated.  That isn’t to say Trump doesn’t also have enthusiastic supporters. We saw that fervor on full display at the RNC. But now, the test will be whether Democrats can match and sustain that enthusiasm this time around."
Trump and Vance’s terrible week was brought to you by TPUSA,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 12:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/turning-point-usa-trump-vance-tpusa-rcna164113,"For all the talk over the past few years about Donald Trump making the Republican Party in his image, it seems increasingly clear to me that he is merely the useful figurehead of a right-wing movement led by activists like Charlie Kirk and others in his well-heeled organization, Turning Point USA. I’ve written a lot about the GOP’s deference to Kirk and his extremist-friendly organization, which has maintained its conservative clout despite repeatedly backing failed candidates. The past week has underscored TPUSA’s power over Republicans as well as the organization’s inseparable bond with Trump and his inner circle, as two controversies surrounding Trump’s campaign had connections to TPUSA. In a speech Friday, Trump claimed that if he’s elected, Christian voters won’t need to vote in 2028 because everything will be “fixed.” These illiberal remarks give the clear impression that Trump is forecasting the end of democracy. And notably, he made these comments at a TPUSA-sponsored event for Christians known as “The Believers’ Summit.” And this came mere days after it was revealed that Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, had written a glowing review for a book written by far-right commentator Jack Posobiec — a Turning Point contributor who is known for his promotion of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory. Posobiec’s book portrays liberals as “unhumans.” As HuffPost reported: These connections between Turning Point USA and the GOP ticket speak to the extremism undergirding the MAGA movement — and TPUSA’s stranglehold on the Republican Party."

"As Biden unveils Supreme Court reform plan, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 11:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-unveils-supreme-court-reform-plan-happens-now-rcna164135,"When President Joe Biden delivered an Oval Office address last week, announcing his decision to end his re-election campaign, the Democratic incumbent briefly touched on some of the priorities he’d pursue in his remaining months in office. Though he didn’t go into any details at the time, Biden told the public, “I’m going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy.” Evidently, he meant it. NBC News reported: In addition to the Post op-ed, the White House issued a fact-sheet overview of Biden’s plan, which has three key provisions: In the recent past, this list might’ve been seen as surprising. After all, Biden has earned a reputation as a longtime institutionalist. But he addressed this point directly in his Post piece, explaining, “I served as a U.S. senator for 36 years, including as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today. I have great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers. “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.” So, what happens now? For those hoping to see rapid reforms, it’s best to lower expectations. It would be up to Congress to pass legislation creating term limits for justices and a binding code of conduct, and that won’t happen anytime soon. Indeed, House Speaker Mike Johnson has already said the White House’s plan is “dead on arrival” in the GOP-led chamber. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained, adding a “No One Is Above the Law Amendment” to the U.S. Constitution is even more difficult. That said, it’s important to appreciate the fact that Biden has jolted a broader conversation. There are some Democrats on Capitol Hill who’ve proposed related reforms, but when it comes to moving an issue into the national spotlight, there’s no substitute for presidential influence. What’s more, Biden has created an intraparty dynamic in which Supreme Court reforms are likely to become an immediate staple of the Democratic agenda. Indeed, it wasn’t long after the president unveiled his reform plan when Vice President Kamala Harris endorsed the same agenda, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone when other Democratic leaders follow suit. Reforming the Supreme Court was on the periphery of the political discourse. Biden has changed that in a hurry, making meaningful changes more likely — eventually. Watch this space."
"Brazenly flip-flopping, Trump adds crypto to his MAGA agenda",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 10:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/brazenly-flip-flopping-trump-adds-crypto-maga-agenda-rcna164108,"Donald Trump tends to use vague language when talking about things he doesn’t understand, but when talking about cryptocurrencies, the Republican was willing to be specific. As regular readers know, the former president has called them a “disaster waiting to happen,” adding that as far as he was concerned, Bitcoin seemed “like a scam.” When it came to crypto, Trump said he was “not a fan,” adding, “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” While in office, he insisted that Bitcoin is “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” And then the evolution started. Ahead of an appearance at the Libertarian Party’s national convention, the GOP nominee declared online in May that he was suddenly “VERY POSITIVE AND OPEN MINDED” on the issue. Around the same time, the former president’s 2024 campaign announced that it would accept donations in cryptocurrency. Last month, one day after Trump met with leaders of several Bitcoin mining companies at Mar-a-Lago, he published a pro-Bitcoin message to his social media platform that he almost certainly didn’t write. In case the flip-flop weren’t quite obvious enough, the Republican removed all doubt over the weekend. The New York Times reported: At times, the audience heard a disjointed message. As he wrapped up his remarks at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, for example, Trump said, “Have a good time with your Bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you’re playing with.” The words of a man who’s given the subject considerable thought, to be sure. Earlier in his remarks, the candidate also asked event attendees to thank him for stopping the Biden administration from doing terrible things to the crypto industry. How, exactly, is Trump standing in the Biden administration’s way? I have no idea, and Trump didn’t say. Perhaps most notably from a policy perspective, the GOP nominee also vowed to create a “national bitcoin stockpile“ for reasons unknown. But with the election in mind, Trump also told his audience that Vice President Kamala Harris intends to wage an “anti-crypto crusade,” as part of an attack against the industry from “left-wing fascists.” What he neglected to say was, “Can you believe Harris is critical of crypto the same way I was before some wealthy donors encouraged me to change my mind?” Indeed, Politico recently published a report with a memorable headline: “Trump keeps flip-flopping his policy positions after meeting with rich people.” Unfortunately, it’s happened quite a bit. For example, Trump supported banning TikTok, only to reverse course after chatting with Jeff Yass, a billionaire hedge fund manager — and prospective campaign donor — who has a multibillion-dollar stake in ByteDance, TikTok’s parent corporation. Something similar appears to have happened with the cryptocurrency industry. Trump also started hedging on some of his immigration policies around the time he met with wealthy corporate executives at a Business Roundtable meeting. A few months earlier, Trump publicly suggested that conservatives should give up on their opposition to Anheuser-Busch shortly before he attended a fundraiser hosted by an Anheuser-Busch lobbyist. It’s tempting to see this as corruption, but it’s worth being more specific about what’s happened. Trump isn’t saying, “I’ll change my position in exchange for money,” he’s instead effectively saying, “Since I don’t care about governing or public policy anyway, I’ll just align my beliefs with my wealthy donors’ preferences.” If recent history is any guide, it’s only a matter of time before this list grows. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
What needs to happen for Biden's presidential immunity amendment to pass,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 7:58 AM PDT / Updated July 29, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-reform-biden-constitutional-amendment-immunity-rcna164042,"It’s official: President Joe Biden is calling for Supreme Court reform. Among his three proposals is a constitutional amendment barring criminal immunity for presidents. Following the Supreme Court’s ruling bestowing broad immunity in Trump v. United States, Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Monday: As opposed to his term limits and enforceable ethics code proposals, this one specifically pushes for a constitutional amendment, which “will state that the Constitution does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President,” according to a White House fact sheet. So, how could an amendment happen? Article V of the Constitution states:  There have been 27 amendments, with the most recent one, regarding congressional pay, taking effect in 1992. And while there are different procedural ways to amend the Constitution, a National Constitution Center analysis notes that the method used for every amendment so far is that: So it’s not an easy process — nor should it be. And as long as Republican politicians are positioned to oppose diluting the Republican supermajority court’s power, then any proposed reform, no matter how reasonable, faces challenges. But Biden’s proposal, which he wrote in his op-ed “are supported by a majority of Americans” when it comes to all three proposed reforms, has started that national conversation.

How Kamala Harris is using Republicans' favorite rhetorical tricks against them,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 9:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-speech-freedom-trump-republicans-rcna163823,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign message is clear: She loves freedom and Donald Trump is weird. In the week since President Joe Biden dropped out and the vice president became the front-runner, she has upended the Democrats' campaign messaging, adding a sharp-edged contrast that borrows a lot from typically Republican rhetoric. Instead of Biden's more earnest approach, her campaign has leaned heavily into simple words with powerful emotional appeals. In her first campaign ad, she recast the Democratic agenda as centered on ""freedom,"" saying the word four times to highlight her support for workers (""the freedom not just to get by, but get ahead""), gun safety laws (""the freedom to be safe from gun violence"") and access to abortion (""the freedom to make decisions about your own body""). In case you somehow missed the message, the minute-long ad is set to Beyoncé's 2016 song ""Freedom,"" which repeats the word another 10 times. She also used the word a dozen times in her short speech at the Democratic campaign headquarters in Delaware, tying it into a broader historical narrative that included bolstering the ""sacred freedom to vote"" on her agenda. ""Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedom,"" she told the gathering of campaign staffers and volunteers. ""Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom from our founders to our framers, to the abolitionists and the suffragettes, to the freedom riders and farmworkers. And now I say team, the baton is in our hands."" In Harris' current campaign, ""freedom"" is favored instead of the more typical Democratic rhetoric about ""reproductive rights"" or ""the right to vote."" She's even recast labor rights as ""the freedom to join a union."" In doing so, she's reclaiming a word that the right has so dominated in recent years that an arch-conservative group in the House simply calls itself the Freedom Caucus. At the same time, the Harris campaign and its Democratic allies have made a sharp turn away from Biden’s serious approach in describing Trump world, adopting a more mocking tone. In a news release, the Harris campaign trolled the former president by saying that “Trump is old and quite weird.” After Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a potential running mate, posted a viral tweet calling Trump ""weird"" for a campaign speech riff on the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, he repeated the word multiple times in an MSNBC interview. For good measure, the Harris campaign also called Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, ""weird and creepy"" over old remarks in which he proposed stopping women from traveling across state lines to get an abortion. In both cases, the strategy is reminiscent of Trump's messaging: pick a simple theme and repeat it over and over and over, like his nicknames ""Crooked Hillary"" Clinton, ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi"" and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden or his promise to ""build the wall"" and ""make America great again."" It's also reminiscent of an approach pioneered by former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich. In 1990, a political organization with ties to him sent a memo to Republican candidates who wanted to ""speak like Newt,"" urging them to describe themselves with positive words like ""freedom,"" ""courage"" and ""strength"" and their opponents with negative words like ""bizarre,"" ""pathetic"" and ""sick."" (The memo even suggested calling rivals ""traitors,"" although in a moment that now feels quaint, the group's head told The New York Times that was a mistake.) The words underscored Gingrich's scorched-earth approach to politics by clearly marking out tribal lines: Your campaign represented all that was good and normal, while your opponents were weirdos who would destroy society if given power. It also made sense, given the starkly different demographics of the two major parties. With a base of college-educated voters, young people and minorities, Democrats are much less judgmental and even embrace being a little offbeat, as shown by things like the famous slogan ""Keep Austin Weird."" With a more homogenous base of voters, Republicans found it easy to single out a Democratic-leaning demographic for ridicule, casting random people like a pro-LGBTQ teacher or Black Lives Matter activist as being outside of the mainstream. Trump regularly called Democrats ""crazy,"" ""pathetic,"" ""sick,"" ""weird"" and ""ridiculous."" But in an ironic twist, all that tribalism made Republicans vulnerable to the same attack. Over the last three decades, many conservatives have become increasingly skeptical of mainstream media, burrowing deeper into alternatives peddled by the likes of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. With little pushback in these echo chambers and gerrymandered House districts, their ideas became increasingly extreme. Vance is a case study in this. His proposal to give parents more votes than adults who don't have children came from a speech at a conservative organization, and his attack on ""childless cat ladies"" on Carlson's now-canceled Fox News show. His idea of stopping women from crossing state lines for an abortion was aired on a far-right podcast and later followed up by a lobbying effort to allow police to access women’s health records. In a telling moment on that podcast, Vance described a bizarre hypothetical in which conservative bogeyman George Soros would send 747s full of Black women seeking abortions from Ohio to California. ""That’s kind of creepy, right?"" he told the host. Of course, Vance meant that his outlandish scenario would be creepy if it came to pass, but since nothing remotely like it is happening, he's the one who ends up seeming outside the mainstream. And with its new focus on calling Republicans ""weird,"" the Harris campaign is determined to let the rest of America know that, too."

(Click the links for information on the surveys’ methodology and margins of error.) * There are quite a few primary races in Arizona tomorrow, and as is usually the case, Bolts has a very helpful rundown on the contests worth watching. * The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll showed a significant improvement in Harris’ favorability rating, while Trump’s favorability rating has dropped.

That’s more than the incumbent president’s campaign raised in the first three months of the year. * On a related note, it’s not just money: Axios reported that in the wake of Biden’s announcement, more than 170,000 volunteers have signed up to help the Democrat’s campaign. * Though there’s been some recent reporting about Trump ending outdoor campaign events in the wake of the recent assassination attempt, the former president declared on Saturday that he’d continue to do outdoor rallies. * A relatively new political action committee, with Republican ties, has begun airing ads that tout independent presidential Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a “progressive Democrat” with “a long record fighting for abortion rights.” The commercials appear to be part of an effort to siphon off Democratic votes and help Trump. * And speaking of the independent candidate, Kennedy told CBS News late last week that “it’s quite possible” more women will make sexual assault allegations against him as the 2024 race continues. “I’m 70 years old,” he said. “I had a very rambunctious life.”"
"Despite his recent track record, Trump pushes bizarre predictions",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 8:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/recent-track-record-donald-trump-bizarre-predictions-election-2024-rcna164080,"Ahead of Election Day 2020, Donald Trump told supporters that a Joe Biden presidency would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” We now know, of course, that the predictions were spectacularly wrong; the United States under Biden has seen a dramatic economic recovery, and Americans are now benefiting from the strongest economy on the planet. In theory, this would be around the time that the former president offered some kind of explanation for being wrong. In practice, Trump is simply recycling the same false predictions. At an event over the weekend, for example, the GOP presidential nominee, pointing to a claim no credible observers have actually made, argued that some believe “if Trump isn’t elected, this country is going to go into a depression the likes of which you had in 1929.” This is, of course, effectively identical to what the Republican predicted four years ago. He was wrong then, and there’s obviously no reason to believe the absurd claim has improved with age. But it’s not just the economy. Trump said crime rates would get worse under Biden, and instead they’ve improved dramatically. On energy policy, in late October 2020, the then-incumbent president declared at a rally that a Biden presidency would mean “no heating in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer, no electricity during peak hours.” Around the same time, Trump told voters: “Under Biden, there will no be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmases, and no Fourth of July.” How’d that one turn out? In August 2020, he also predicted that if Biden were to win, “we will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell.” Four years later, capitalism remains intact, there’s nothing boring about the United States, and I’m pleased to report that the country isn’t going to hell. I don’t doubt that Trump will continue to make ridiculous predictions in the coming months, but sensible observers should take note: This guy’s crystal ball clearly doesn’t work."
"Rejecting ‘unity,’ Trump says ‘maybe I’ve gotten worse’ after shooting",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 7:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rejecting-unity-trump-says-maybe-ve-gotten-worse-shooting-rcna164064,"Two weeks ago today, Axios reported that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Donald Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added: “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America.” Four days later, Politico published a related report, noting that in the aftermath of the shooting, “Republicans who have observed and spoken with former President Donald Trump say they have detected a new softness to the man whose brand has been anything but.” The article added, “GOP allies, in roughly a dozen interviews, used words like ‘emotional’ and ‘serene’ — even ‘spiritual’ — to describe Trump in the days since the attempt on his life.” Democrats were skeptical. The GOP nominee effectively told a Minnesota audience on Saturday night that his partisan foes were right to question the reporting. The New York Times reported: “I want to be nice,” Mr. Trump said. “They all say, ‘I think he’s changed. I think he’s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him.’” But to a cheering crowd of thousands, Mr. Trump quickly conceded the point. “No, I haven’t changed,” he said. “Maybe I’ve gotten worse.” Let’s not forget that the morning after the attempt on his life, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United.” Hours later, the Republican was even more succinct, adding, “UNITE AMERICA!” This attitude has obviously been thrown out the window, as Trump effectively conceded over the weekend with his “maybe I’ve gotten worse” acknowledgement. On ABC News’ “This Week,” Martha Raddatz asked New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu yesterday about whether Trump is missing an opportunity by abandoning a “unity” focus. “He’s missing it now,” the Republican governor replied, “but hopefully they can get back on track.” What Sununu neglected to mention is that Trump, by all appearances, has absolutely no interest in getting a “unity” focus “back on track.” Consider what happened just two weeks before the 2018 midterm elections. Ten Democratic officials and/or veterans of the Obama administration were targeted with packages containing explosive devices, and soon after, Trump complained that media coverage of “bomb stuff” was interfering with the Republican Party’s election season strategies. Asked whether the mail bombs might lead to a shift in his political tone, the then-president replied: “Tone down? No. Could tone up.” Common sense might’ve suggested a more responsible course. Democrats were targeted with explosives, at which point Trump could’ve at least pretended to care about vitriolic rhetoric. He instead told reporters in the wake of the attempted violence that he was prepared to possibly make the toxic political atmosphere worse — on purpose. Nearly six years later, it seems very little has changed."
Transcript: Mobilized,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 7:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/transcript-rachel-maddow-presents-ultra-season-2-episode-7-mobilized-rcna164071,"Transcript Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra Episode 7: Mobilized With Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy facing the most serious challenge of his political life-- a looming censure vote in the U.S. Senate-- McCarthy’s most fervent supporters raise up an army to fight in his defense. The effort, which draws together mainstream Republicans and McCarthy’s most radical followers on the ultra right, will involve threats of violence, harassment, and an armed show of force on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rachel Maddow: They don’t appear to be policemen, not really. They carry themselves sort of like policemen, and they are wearing uniforms. But their uniforms are plain black. And there is a shield on their caps, but it’s a generic shield. If you squint, it kind of seems like a police thing. But it’s not. They’re not cops. One reason you can be sure they’re not cops is that when the real cops show up, the real cops kind of freak out. It’s December 1st, 1954, and no one is supposed to be holding loaded revolvers at the doors of the United States Capitol. But these men are. And they have orders. They are there acting on behalf of a new group that is mobilizing and now for some reason brandishing weapons in defense of their political hero. Reporter: One of the most controversial figures ever to appear on this nation’s political stage... Maddow: These men at the Capitol have unholstered their guns. They are holding them at their sides, as heavy cardboard boxes are loaded out of an armored truck. The presence of an unexpected, uninvited armored truck at the doors to the U.S. Senate, the presence of these men with their weapons drawn, it creates some alarm on the Senate floor, especially when senators learn that one of the armed men has actually come inside, has entered the Capitol. The sergeant at arms is called to investigate. And the Washington police. David Austin Walsh: It’s a very deliberately choreographed moment. Maddow: That’s author and historian David Austin Walsh. Walsh: It was an attempt to show political strength. Maddow: The boxes that are being unloaded from the truck are full of petitions. A new group that didn’t even exist a month earlier has hastily gathered these petitions from all over the country. And now their leader, a controversial right-wing retired Navy admiral, has ordered a handful of these guards for the truck to draw their weapons as the petitions are hand-delivered into the Senate. Walsh: They were trying to sell this as almost a Hollywood moment, showing that the real Americans, what Nixon would later call the “Silent Majority,” were behind Joe McCarthy, contrary to what you would read in the press. Maddow: Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin is facing a censure in the United States Senate. It’s only the third one in Senate history. Just hours before the vote, diehard McCarthy supporters have marched to the U.S. Capitol to show the Senators inside that they’ll be going up against an army of real Americans if they move ahead with that vote. And there are counter-protesters too. There are worries about what might happen if the two sides come up against each other in the streets... Reporter: It’ll be violent and bitter, I’m sorry to say. Maddow: Violent and bitter. The armored truck and the men holding their guns do not lessen the tension. Reporter: The pro-McCarthy marchers say they want a peaceful and dignified operation down here, but if the anti-McCarthy marchers come in, I wonder just how peaceful it will be if they all tangle together up there on the Hill. Maddow: Joe McCarthy has made a very profitable political sport out of dramatizing the threat of an enemy within, an America beset by shadowy, powerful, internal conspirators who McCarthy alone is willing to expose and willing to fight. It creates an intense and emotional following for him, built on cathartic anger and grievance and fear and loyalty only to him. He’s done it by singling out relatively powerless individuals for public destruction. Humiliating, threatening, legitimately ruining the lives of regular Americans who he has targeted. But McCarthy has also left a body count among the powerful, among his Senate peers, who one after another have been destroyed by McCarthy and his allies, McCarthy and his movement, as punishment, as retribution, for any act of opposition to him. Members of the opposition party, members of his own party have feared challenging him in public, and for good reason. But by this point -- by the end of 1954 -- Joe McCarthy’s own actions are finally starting to catch up to him. What began all the way back in the Malmedy investigation has landed him here. Drew Pearson: Will Senator McCarthy finally be censured? The Senate is now split for and against McCarthy. Maddow: The Malmedy hearings had seen McCarthy pushing Nazi propaganda to the public, attacking Jewish U.S. Army investigators with false claims that came from unrepentant Nazis in Germany and from the convicted Nazi perpetrators of a massacre of American POWs. By the start of this year, 1954, Joe McCarthy was doing it again. This time it was about the Fort Monmouth Army Base in New Jersey. McCarthy made false, totally baseless accusations that dozens of predominantly Jewish scientists and engineers at that Army base were secret Communist spies. Sen. Joe McCarthy: Some of them will be recommended for indictment for perjury. I assume some of them will go to jail. The important thing, however is exposing, getting them out of the places where they can do the most damage. Maddow: Those false accusations destroyed the careers of many of those scientists, tore apart their lives. But they also helped bring about hearings. The Army-McCarthy hearings that millions of people all across the country watched on live TV. Sen. John McClellan: This committee therefore has the responsibility and the duty in the course of these hearings to develop the facts and to establish the truth or the falsity of the accusations that have been made. Maddow: These televised hearings go on for weeks. And they famously do not go well for Joe McCarthy. His tactics and his temperament don’t play as well on TV as they used to. And his case against the Army is just factually incoherent. It’s clear to everyone in the hearing room. It’s also clear to millions of Americans who are watching at home. Army Secretary Robert Stevens: The United States Army does not coddle communists. This committee knows that. The American people know that. Maddow: And then by the end of that year, by the end of 1954, there is another factor in play for McCarthy, which is that members of the U.S. Senate have just been forced to bury one of their own. One of the most popular men in the Senate. Wyoming Senator Lester Hunt had confronted Joe McCarthy. He’d been rewarded for that with an escalating and personal blackmail campaign by McCarthy and two other Republican senators, a blackmail campaign that culminated in Hunt taking his own life. Here’s Wyoming author Rodger McDaniel. Rodger McDaniel: The suicide of one of their own, because of the behavior of Senator McCarthy, was seen by many in the Senate as the time that they had to draw the line. Something had to be done. Maddow: Something had to be done. No previous effort to hold Joe McCarthy accountable, to punish McCarthy for anything he had done had ever worked. But they would at least have to try. Walsh: It’s a way for the Senate to kind of wash their hands of a guy that nobody ever liked in the first place. Reporter: Senator Watkins will present appropriate resolutions to make the recommendations effective, and that is a censure on two counts, and ask for a vote. Then will come the avalanche. Maddow: When the censure resolution is officially put up for debate, it’s not at all clear that it will have the votes to pass. After those messy, televised hearings where McCarthy came off so poorly, the broad public might have been cooling on McCarthy and his tactics, but his supporters still are legion. And their support for him, if anything, is becoming more fervent, maybe even more radical. McCarthy’s colleagues in the Senate are made well aware of that. Walsh: Members of Congress say they’ve never gotten the volume of hate mail they’ve gotten in ‘54 because of the McCarthy censure. Maddow: Senators who support the censure of Joe McCarthy are inundated with hate mail. Senator William Fulbright, he had been derided by Joe McCarthy as “Half-bright,” he entered some of his hate mail into the Congressional record. “Red skunk: I will not dignify you with the title of Senator. You are a disgrace to the United States Senate. A dirty Red rat like you should be kicked out. You’re not fit to clean Senator McCarthy’s shoes. Hope you are struck by God.” Another Senator described the summer of 1954 as a “hot summer of hysteria,” due to McCarthy’s, quote, “highly charged, emotional, and inflammable personal following.” That senator neatly filed the hate mail he received with a local university. Quote, “For the good of the country, my only prayer is that Communist Eisenhower will soon be impeached or assassinated.” Quote, “God has judged you. McCarthy will be avenged, if not by the courts then by God’s own people.” Some of the mail fantasized that the avenging had already started, in which this evil cabal that McCarthy had started to expose was secretly being rounded up and imprisoned. Quote, “I can understand now why you demanded a closed-door session, the Roosevelt and Truman gutter trash officials demanded closed doors, too. They are now in prison for their secret work.” Walsh: You’re smearing a great American patriot. You’re -- you know, you’re being duped by the communists. Are you -- are you a communist yourself, Senator? That is such a constant theme in these hate mail letters. Maddow: Some senators resorted to disconnecting their phones because of McCarthy supporters’ late night screaming phone calls to their homes. And they came in person too. When the censure debate formally began in the Senate, McCarthy supporters come by bus, by carload from Wisconsin, from Texas, from Florida. They chartered their own train from New York City. Gerald L. K. Smith, the rabidly antisemitic preacher from the America First Party and the Christian Nationalist Crusade, he came to Washington himself to help lead the grassroots opposition. He set up a makeshift war room inside a hotel room right near the Capitol, a detail reported with characteristic punch by the journalist Drew Pearson. Pearson: The Mayflower Hotel. Gerald L. K. Smith, the rabble-rouser, is registered in room 1017 at the Mayflower in order to be with Joe McCarthy in his time of crisis. Smith and his wife are registered under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Goodyear, room 1017, in case anyone wants to call him. Maddow: From his headquarters inside the Mayflower Hotel, Gerald L.K. Smith and others advise the angry McCarthy army on what they should do. Walsh: Among that element of the electorate, that, you know, 20 percent hardcore, you know, American right movement, he is a saint, he’s a martyr figure. Maddow: A saint and a martyr. He’s their hero. As far as his supporters are concerned, he’s the only one they can trust. He’s the only real patriot. And now he’s going to be punished? He’s going to be censured? How dare they. No, if they have anything to say about it, he’s not going to be punished. He’s going to be president. This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” McCarthy: This fight to expose those who would destroy this nation will go on and on! Reporter: Would his strategy be to put himself in a position before the country of being a martyr? Crowd Singing: Nobody’s for McCarthy, but the people! Lawyer: Senator McCarthy will vigorously defend himself against these three charges. ******************************** Maddow: Episode 7: Mobilized. The place is packed to the rafters. Turnout is so good that organizers have gotten permission from the police to mount a loudspeaker outside so the overflow crowd that can’t get in can still hear what’s being said inside. Even though the crowds have been organizing at the Capitol since sunrise, packing the Senate Gallery, cramming into Senate offices and hallways, they’ve showed no signs of slowing down all day. And now that night they’re at Constitution Hall in Washington to show the strength in their numbers and in their anger. The Senator who introduced the censure resolution against Joe McCarthy is Ralph Flanders of Vermont. Radio Anchor: One man said today his group never will forgive Senator Flanders, who started the censure. Maddow: He has already had to have a police guard assigned to his home. After McCarthy attacked Flanders by saying, “I think they should get a net and take him to a good quiet place,” McCarthy supporters have brought big nets with them to this rally at Constitution Hall. They are holding signs that say they are looking for Senator Flanders. And there are other homemade signs. “Senator McCarthy Deserves a Citation Instead of Censure,” and “Give McCarthy What He Deserves: The Congressional Medal of Honor.” This is a raucous crowd at Constitution Hall, an emotional one. The rally is deep into its third hour of pro-McCarthy speeches and songs when there’s a surprise appearance that absolutely brings down the house. Sen. Herman Welker: One of the greatest living foes of communist slavery, that man is Joe McCarthy. (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Senator Joe McCarthy isn’t supposed to be at that rally at Constitution Hall in Washington. But then he is, a surprise to the crowd. Police surround him and his wife as they walk through the crowd of thousands of supporters, people pressing in on them on every side, trying to touch him, trying to shake his hand. An AP reporter describes the crowd as going, quote, “wild” when they realized McCarthy is in the room. A Scripps-Howard reporter says when McCarthy appeared, quote, “That did it. Everyone was on his feet in an instant and the deafening roar was like nothing that the screaming, foot-stamping assemblage had produced before.” McCarthy takes the stage. He says he’s “sick deep down inside” because of the, quote, “double-crossing” and the “double-dealing” that he says is behind the censure effort against him. McCarthy: Take my word for it, my good friends, regardless, and I make you this solemn promise, regardless of what this Senate may do about a censure, this fight to expose those who would destroy this nation will go on and on, regardless! (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Senator McCarthy, at several points in his speech, is so overcome with emotion that he is moved to tears. Photos of McCarthy will run in newspapers all across the country, photos showing him weeping and wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. People in the audience are weeping as well. They start to sing for him. (CROWD SINGING FOR MCCARTHY) (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Despite the passion and the rage of his supporters, despite his track record of destroying anyone who opposed him, senators had finally mustered the courage to consider a censure vote against McCarthy. But still they were wary. Reporter: This thing, of course, has a lot of unpredictable elements. Maddow: They decided in 1954 to delay the vote on his censure until after the midterm elections that year. They were fearful of how the electorate would react. Reporter: Well, the elections will be over when the Senate does come back, but meantime, out there now are the voters. Maddow: By the time the vote is finally getting near in November, McCarthy’s supporters are fully mobilized. Two days after that huge Constitutional Hall rally in Washington, there’s a dinner in his honor in his home state in Milwaukee. Fifteen hundred people show up in another raucous, foot-stomping show of support. Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona is there to support him at that dinner. He tells the crowd that McCarthy is a great American who is seeking the truth. McCarthy condemns the senators who support his censure as a, quote, “movement of people not loyal to our country.” And then there’s the rally in New York, Madison Square Garden. Thirteen thousand people. Roy Cohn: If the United States Senate should take a vote of censure against this man who has led us, the Senate will have been committing the blackest act in its entire history. Maddow: That’s Joe McCarthy’s chief attack dog in the Senate, his counsel Roy Cohn. This huge rally at Madison Square Garden, like the one in Washington, it is emotional. It’s raucous. Walsh: When Joe McCarthy, who is facing, you know, political ruin, is able to pack Madison Square Garden with thousands of fervent supporters who are convinced that he is America’s savior against subversion, that tells you something. That tells you something about the depth of -- not the breadth -- but the depth of his political support. Maddow: The crowd here shouts its approval when speakers denounce -- quote -- “the leftist press.” At the mention of the words “New York Times,” they boo and scream. There’s a female photographer here from TIME magazine. She has to be escorted out of the event for her own safety when the crowd turns against her. They’re screaming at her: “Hang the communist bitch!” Here, at the rally, up on the dais, is a former congressman, Hamilton Fish. Rep. Hamilton Fish: I have no patience with those Americans who tremble every time Hitler sneezes or get jittery every time he opens his mouth. Maddow: After a long career in the U.S. House, Hamilton Fish had finally been voted out of office once his dealings with the Nazi agent George Sylvester Viereck were exposed to the public. Radio Announcer: And over on the House side, Ham Fish of New York winds up a 22-year record. Maddow: Former Congressman Hamilton Fish had been there in Washington at the emotional Constitution Hall event for McCarthy. And now, at Madison Square Garden, here’s Fish again, with pride of place, up on stage. Here, in the audience is Gerald L.K. Smith, whose magazine, “The Cross and the Flag,” just last month included pronouncements like: “The international Jew machine resolved to destroy the German race.” This month’s edition has a full-page cover photo, “The Fearless Fighting Patriot: U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.” A large contingent of the crowd here has been organized by the neo-Nazi National Renaissance Party. Ross: They considered him as -- they would say at meetings, “Saint Joe.” And he was a true American patriot. Maddow: The National Renaissance Party leader who helped organize this rally is the same guy who led that pro-German Holocaust denial rally in Yorkville, New York, that had scheduled Joe McCarthy as its headline speaker in 1952. The year after that, the same guy had toured Germany at the invitation of Nazi lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer. He gave speeches to unrepentant Nazi groups. He called for Germany to return to Nazi rule. The German government was not having it. They had his passport seized and deported him back to the United States, just in time for him to become a key organizer for the movement to support Senator Joseph McCarthy and to organize this event. It was a pretty rich blend there that night.  At “The New York Times,” William S. White described it this way. He said: “The anti-censure forces have drawn up a cadre that clearly represents the largest reemergence and coming together of essentially right-wing groups since before the United States entered the Second World War.” Like in the lead-up to World War II, the key dynamic at work was not just the presence of an American ultra-right, but the mix of the ultra right and mainstream electoral power. Here, after all, at Madison Square Garden was an event organized by a man just kicked out of Germany for being too much of a Nazi. At the same event, attendees are also hearing a stirring speech from the sitting governor of Utah. Here’s an event attended by Gerald L.K. Smith, who advocates the forced sterilization and deportation of all American Jews. But it’s also attended by a polite contingent of supporters of the late Senator Robert Taft, AKA Mr. Republican. Here in the crowd at Madison Square Garden is William F. Buckley Jr., a man of growing influence on the right. He has just published “God and Man at Yale.” And he’s here alongside James Madole, the National Renaissance Party leader. He’s just published something, too. Something titled “Adolf Hitler: The George Washington of Europe.” Walsh: McCarthy operated as a sort of linchpin for, you know, laundering far-right influence into the political mainstream in American politics. Maddow: FBI files show that the bureau had started staking out pro-McCarthy events in 1954, like a Roy Cohn speech in Baltimore, expecting that these were the kinds of events where fugitive fascist Francis Parker Yockey might be likely to turn up. They might be able to apprehend him, to question him about his Nazi ties, about his spying inside the Nazi war crimes trials, about his travels to the Middle East to try to sell plans for a cobalt bomb. Here was a powerful, transgressive, menacing, but also ascendant American political movement built from the start on surprisingly porous border ground between the unthinkably extremist edge and mainstream electoral politics. Now, as their leader fights for his political life, as his opponents finally are summoning the courage to confront him with the kind of sanction that’s intended to knock him out of politics, who will hold their nerve, as the radical movement he’s marshaled makes its show of force, and he presents himself to them as their martyr? Reporter: Wouldn’t you think that a man in Senator McCarthy’s position, and facing this likely censure, would -- would -- would his strategy be to put himself in a position before the country of being a martyr, and that his friends would play along that strategy line? Maddow: That’s next. ******************************** (CROWD SINGING FOR MCCARTHY) (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Joe McCarthy is defending himself against censure by the U.S. Senate. At a string of large and intense rallies supporting him, crowds are singing his name. They’re weeping when he speaks, reaching out to try to touch him. Now McCarthy wants more time, more time to demonstrate to his Senate colleagues just how big a mistake it would be for them to take him on in this way. Lawyer: All I can say is that Senator McCarthy will vigorously defend himself against these three charges when a full hearing is held on the floor of the Senate. Maddow: Even after Senate leaders decide to delay the censure vote until after the election, McCarthy’s still pressing for even more of a delay. Of course, he’d like to delay it indefinitely, if possible, but at this point, he’ll take anything he can get. After the election, he comes up with an unexpected way to buy himself even more time. Reporter: His right arm still in a sling because of an injured elbow, the legislator from Wisconsin... Maddow: An injured elbow? McCarthy informs the Senate that there cannot be a censure vote against him, because he has come down with traumatic bursitis of the elbow. He says it happened while he was receiving an overenthusiastic handshake from an overenthusiastic supporter too near a glass tabletop. And it has left him so laid up that the censure proceedings must stop. Now, the exact nature of this injury is never clear, but McCarthy produced a doctor’s note claiming that he needed not just hospitalization, but full uninterrupted bed rest in order to recover from this traumatic bursitis of the elbow. That pesky Drew Pearson reported that McCarthy was regularly taking breaks from his hospitalization and his bed rest to go have dinner and drinks with friends. Drew Pearson, Journalist: McCarthy, according to Senate colleagues, is now pleading the Bethesda Hospital Amendment in order to drag out the censure debate as long as possible. Maddow: Pleading the Bethesda Hospital Amendment. People also called this Joe McCarthy’s elbow filibuster. But it did work. The Republican Senate Majority Leader was more than happy to treat the elbow story with all the seriousness he could muster. He announced that the McCarthy censure debate and vote would be delayed a further ten days. Pearson: McCarthy is stalling for time to permit the rolling up of 10 million signatures. Maddow: If McCarthy has bought himself ten whole days with this elbow gambit, well, his supporters are going to make the most of it. In those 10 days, they decide they’ll collect 10 million signatures in support of McCarthy. 10 million signatures in 10 days to stop the censure. Newspapers all over the country front-page this lightning petition drive. “LIFE” Magazine does a photo spread of housewives signing people up on street corners, people lining up to sign and to volunteer. “The Orlando Sentinel” publishes the actual petition itself in a handy clip-out form. They say it is “a service to the thousands of Central Florida citizens who believe in the principles for which Senator McCarthy stands and who are eager to do their part for the preservation of our American way of life.” The group that forms to collect the signatures announces plans for offices from coast to coast. John G. Crommelin, Senator Joseph McCarthy Supporter: We’ve had requests from people all over the country to set up auxiliary headquarters. I remember one from Basin, Wyoming, Yakima, Washington, all the way to the west coast. This particular petition has been mushrooming at such a tremendous rate that it’s beginning to look like that, not 10 million, but we could probably get 20 million signatures if we just had the time. Maddow: Twenty million signatures if only we had a few more days. A member of the neo-Nazi militia group, the National Renaissance Party, takes over as the New Jersey co-chair of the Ten Million Americans effort for McCarthy. The group’s leader, James Madole, starts urging New Yorkers to sign those McCarthy petitions. Ross: Madole found Joe McCarthy the only American politician really worth listening to and supporting. Maddow: The National Renaissance Party even starts using a new name. The group starts holding meetings under the name “Patriots for McCarthy.” A Washington reporter, Robert L. Riggs, writes that McCarthy is -- quote -- “appealing over the heads of the senators to the people of the country. He is drawing a picture of himself as the crucified enemy of traitors within our gates.” If your political hero, your saint, is being crucified, how much is too much when it comes to showing your support for him, when it comes to backing him up? Walsh: The day before the censure vote, an armored car pulls up to the Capitol Building with armed guards. Maddow: Armed guards at the entrance to the Senate with their pistols drawn the day before the censure vote. That same day, as that unfolds outside the Senate, that literal show of force to the senators inside, the Republican Senate Majority Leader announces that he’s made his decision on censure. His vote will be no. He’s standing with McCarthy. The pressure campaign that has been building for weeks with the pro-McCarthy rallies and the petitions and this weird threatening spectacle of how the petitions were brought to the Capitol, McCarthy supporters harassing senators with hate mail and late-night phone calls to their homes, threats of violence, death threats, that kind of stuff isn’t just for fun. It’s for effect. And there are Republicans in the Senate who initially supported censuring McCarthy, who now change their minds. Pearson: Here is the backstage reason why Senator Case of South Dakota suddenly went into reverse and without telling... Maddow: On top of everything else they’re doing, McCarthy and his allies start hunting for dirt on individual senators to use as leverage to get them to vote no. Pearson: McCarthy has a secret bombshell to explode against Senator Flanders. Maddow: McCarthy insists publicly that he’s going to win this fight either way. Pearson: McCarthy has admitted to friends privately that he wants to be censured and go down as a martyr. Friends have begged him to make a public apology. But McCarthy stubbornly refused and snorted that he would rather be censured than apologize. Maddow: That idea, that McCarthy wanted to be able to claim martyrdom, that, even as he fought it, he might welcome censure because it would allow him to portray himself as the victim of political persecution, the fact that that was increasingly clear as his political strategy, it didn’t make it any easier to combat. Reporter: Would -- would his strategy be to put himself in a position before the country of being a martyr and that his friends would -- would -- would play along that strategy line? Reporter: Well, Dick, I have thought of that. I have never -- I have never thought of it in exactly the words that you put it up. Would that be his strategy? But I have thought that events could turn around so that the public would accept him as -- a large part of the public would accept him as a martyr. It seems to be their stock-in-trade or their battle cry. Maddow: McCarthy and his allies also mounted another defense as well. In addition to the political persecution claim, they also said that McCarthy and those on his side, people who could vouch for him inside the government, who could contribute to his defense, they were being gagged. They were somehow not being allowed to speak. Reporter: I think there was an indication today that McCarthy and Williams, his lawyer, were going to try to stress this gag idea. If McCarthy can cry gag, then he moves the battle more to his -- his own sort of approach. This is what he likes to do. He likes to go on the offensive to take the attack. And he says: Look, I have got a witness here, but you won’t let him talk. Maddow: After all the posturing, and the delays, and the elbow filibuster, and the rallies, and the brandishing of guns on the steps of the Capitol, it’s finally time for the Senate to vote. Newsreel: Spectators converge on the Senate chamber, where the upper house in heated parliamentary debate votes a public rebuke of one of its members, Senator Joseph McCarthy. Maddow: This is a very, very rare thing in U.S. history. There were two senators who were censured in 1902, another one in 1929, but that’s it, and it hasn’t happened since then. Newsreel: Joseph McCarthy is the fourth Senator in history to be so disciplined by his colleagues in the Capitol -- 67-to-22, it condemns him for his conduct. Maddow: Among Democrats in the Senate that day, the vote is 44-0 in favor of censuring Joe McCarthy. On the Republican side, half of the Republicans in the Senate vote in his favor. McCarthy biographer Richard Rovere said the half of Senate Republicans who voted with McCarthy were -- quote -- “by and large, the more influential half.” Joe McCarthy is ultimately censured, but his grip on his own party substantially remains. Walsh: It’s important that he still has support. It’s not a universal censure. Maddow: It’s not universal. In the end, it’s not even technically a censure. By the time the Senate actually takes the vote, the censure resolution has been watered down to the point where it no longer even includes the word censure. Officially, it’s a condemnation of Senator McCarthy. McCarthy: They went right straight down the party line. Every Democrat voted against us in this condemnation -- call it what you may -- even though they proclaimed over and over that this was a judicial proceeding. Reporter: How does it feel to be a condemned senator? McCarthy: I feel no different tonight than I did last night. I am very happy to have this circus ended, so that we can get back to the work of digging out communism, corruption, treason in government. Reporter: Senator, do you feel that you have not been censured in this action? McCarthy: I wouldn’t say that today was a vote of confidence. Reporter: Senator, at the beginning, you called this the lynching bee. Do you feel now you’ve been lynched? Maddow: When Senator McCarthy was finally censured, or condemned, by a vote of his own Senate colleagues, the resolution they passed against him did not criticize McCarthy’s lies about his enemies and his targets, his promotion of false Nazi propaganda, his blackmail against Senator Lester Hunt. The resolution they passed against him called him out instead for his discourteousness toward his fellow senators, for violating Senate rules and traditions in his interactions with two Senate committees. They basically criticized him for being rude to his co-workers on a couple of occasions. And that was it. And even that was a bridge too far for half of the Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Walsh: There are people who are taking a stand in the Senate, saying McCarthy did nothing wrong. And that’s because of the intensity of the support on the right for McCarthy. Maddow: For the most intense McCarthy supporters out there this censure fight, this condemnation not only is it effectively toothless against him; it’s proof of the evil of McCarthy’s enemies. It’s proof that our system of government, the American system of government, maybe is broken. Maybe it should be cast aside entirely. The day after the Senate vote, the very next day, the National Renaissance Party gathers in New York under its new meant-to-be-less-Nazi-seeming banner, calling themselves “Patriots for McCarthy.” According to FBI records, at that meeting, the group’s leader, James Madole -- quote -- “advocated a break with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,” which he said were “completely outmoded and no longer filled the country’s needs.” The group then starts to discuss what it would take to make Joe McCarthy president of the United States in the next election. Walsh: They wanted to turn McCarthy from a martyr back into a hero. It is a moment of broad grassroots mobilization by American conservatives that provides a sort of template -- a blueprint -- for future action. Maddow: The organizing, the petition drives, the protests, the mass rallies, the new organizations that sprung up in his name, the old organizations that changed their names to support him explicitly, it could all now be put to a new use, not just to try to stop the censure of McCarthy, but to promote McCarthy to the peak of American power. Senator Arthur Watkins, who chaired the committee that handled the McCarthy censure, he said that McCarthy was on course to -- quote -- “become the political leader, the nationalist hero of a cross-party-lines faction.” He said McCarthy would be “the man on a white horse” for what he called “the right-wing, know-nothing element of American politics.” If that movement succeeded in elevating him on those terms, Watkins said he believed McCarthy could -- quote -- “be carried to unbelievable, even unthinkable, power.” Reporter: He followed the full-throated blast with a long pause, and then quiet tones, tones of shock and sadness. Then, in another moment, the full blast again, the documents waved in air, at the end, a wild burst of applause and cries. Anyone present would have thought this man cannot miss the White House. Maddow: The accepted common wisdom today when it comes to Joe McCarthy is that the Senate censure vote spelled the end for him; it started a quick and then uninterrupted descent into irrelevance. In reality, for a large part of the Republican Party and its base, and for the American ultra-right, which supported him to the hilt, and which he had never disavowed, McCarthy remained as popular as ever. Walsh: The people who loved Joe McCarthy at the beginning of 1954 still loved Joe McCarthy at the end of 1954, and they loved McCarthy, you know, in all caps. Maddow: He was their champion, the only one they believed in. He’d taken that Senate censure vote for them to show them that the so-called system, the American system that could allow this to happen to their hero, it was corrupt and rotten and ripe to be overthrown. For all the slings and arrows that he had borne on their behalf, they were going to repay McCarthy by elevating him to the highest office in the country. Walsh: Drafting McCarthy for President was a way -- it was a way for right-wingers to assert, in a sense, their own dignity in the face of what they perceived to be this horrific and anti-American smear campaign. Maddow: Just two months after that censure vote, there was Joe McCarthy being greeted by a minute-long standing ovation from a crowd of 2,000 Republicans in Chicago. As the 1956 presidential election hit high gear, there was Joe McCarthy speaking before a capacity crowd of 4,000 people at Carnegie Hall in New York City. A month after that, it was a pro-McCarthy rally of another 4,000 people in Washington, D.C., and a specific plan of action. As the censure of McCarthy enraged the right, as their arguments turned angrily to the idea that normal electoral American politics could not be trusted anymore that there would have to be some new way to save the country, a group founded and funded by Robert McCormick, publisher of “The Chicago Tribune,” started promoting a plan, a new plan to basically monkey-wrench the next presidential election. Radio commentator: The inevitable, chanted response was: “How? Tell us how.” The final recommendation for popular action was so simple and so practical that it startled the assembled patriots. Maddow: The plan would not be to compete in politics in the normal sense, to try to win the most votes. Instead, the plan would be to grab hold of the fragile, arcane system of counting the votes. Radio commentator: The nationwide popular vote that is apparently cast for a presidential candidate in the November election has nothing at all to do with his victory or defeat. Maddow: They would gin up new slates, surprise slates of electors in enough states to mess with the electoral vote count in Washington, which is, after all, what actually decides the presidency. Radio commentator: Every American voter is qualified under state statutes, rather than by national laws. Each state may select these electors in any manner that the state legislature desires. I am more than ever convinced that not one American in 10,000 completely understands the constitutional power of the 531 presidential electors all told. Maddow: Robert McCormick’s group, which was called For America, they might not be able to field a candidate who could win the presidency in the normal sense of the word. But with a plan like this, a plan focused on messing up the Electoral College count, well, they might be able to get it anyway. Radio commentator: We can get our wish by qualifying a slate of American presidential elector candidates in our respective states. In some jurisdictions, the process is more difficult than in others. In a number of states, patriots are already far advanced on these necessary prerequisites. Maddow: If you could just inject enough chaos into the counting of the Electoral College vote, that the election could be thrown to Congress, to a vote in the U. S. House of Representatives, well, maybe, at that point, you could get a real patriot over the top and into the White House, no matter how the country had voted in the election. Radio commentator: Some of my wise and trusted friends in certain states of the Union are confident that their existing local political organizations can be trusted to protect the voters of those states against the dreaded possibility of two one-world socialist tickets in November. Maddow: It would come to a head not in November, not during the vote, but afterwards in the first week of January, when Congress would gather in special session to count the electoral vote. Radio commentator: This is the master key to any plan for pro-American electors in 1956. Maddow: The master key to unlock an America where a real patriot can win, or where he doesn’t need to win, but he’ll take power anyway. That is next time on the final episode of “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Radio commentator: Between these contending viewpoints, my friends, lies a long stick of political dynamite with fuses now burning at both ends.

And it was -- you were an irritant to McCarthy and to his people just by doing your job. Murrey Marder, Reporter: I would often be in the office until 10:00, 11:00 at night. My colleague Phil Potter, he would say: “Well, what do you think we’re accomplishing?” I said: “We have to operate on the premise, the only premise I know of, that if you keep putting enough light on the situation, that you will hopefully have some consequence. Something will happen as a result of it.” He said: “What the hell do you think is going to happen out of this?” I said: “Well, eventually, people are going to see what this is like and you will be repelled by it, if they understand what is happening.” “Well, what’s that going to do?” I said: “Well, that makes him a subject of ridicule.” “Well, who the hell -- he doesn’t care if anybody ridicules him or not.” I said: “Yes, he will.” You know, you can only operate on the only journalistic premise that I know is that it has some effect. And if it doesn’t -- doesn’t have an effect, we should be, all be in the -- in the bottling business or something. (LAUGHTER) Interviewer: That’s right."
Why Trump’s dual endorsement in a key Republican primary matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 6:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-dual-endorsement-key-republican-primary-matters-rcna164038,"Once in a great while, Donald Trump will look at a primary, size up the Republican candidates, struggle to settle on a favorite, and end up endorsing more than one contender. Two years ago this week, for example, the former president endorsed two leading contenders in a Senate primary in Missouri. As NBC News reported, the GOP’s presidential nominee has done the same thing in a closely watched congressional primary in Arizona, though the circumstances in this race are worth a closer look. “We have a very important Republican Primary Election on Tuesday for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, with two spectacular America First Candidates,” Trump wrote in a message published to his social media platform. “Both Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh have my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Congressman of Arizona’s 8th Congressional District.” At first blush, this might look like a replay of the Missouri race: Trump liked both candidates, so he endorsed both candidates. But in this specific primary, it’s not that simple. This Arizona district, just north of Phoenix, is a Republican stronghold, and it’s generally understood that the winner of the GOP primary is all but certain to win the House seat. It was against this backdrop that Trump publicly endorsed Hamadeh eight months ago, choosing him over Masters, despite the fact that the former president endorsed Masters’ ill-fated Senate candidacy two years ago. Nevertheless, as the local congressional primary has unfolded, Masters has repeatedly suggested that he enjoyed Trump’s support, pointing to the former president’s 2022 backing. In one campaign ad, for example, viewers were told “TRUMP ENDORSED MASTERS” in bold letters — while a smaller font added, “IN SENATE CAMPAIGN.” It reached the point at which Susie Wiles, Trump’s campaign manager, reportedly called Masters directly about this. Politico reported earlier this month that Wiles urged the Arizonan “to pull or change ads” that falsely implied that he had Trump’s support in his congressional campaign. Three weeks later, Trump extended his support to Masters’ congressional campaign. For Hamadeh, the news was likely a punch to the gut. Hamadeh, who narrowly lost a state attorney general race in the Grand Canyon State in 2022, has based much of his candidacy on the fact that he was the Trump-backed candidate in the primary. And while that’s still the case, as the race approaches the finish line, the former president has apparently decided that Hamadeh is no longer the only Trump-backed candidate in the primary. It’s difficult to speculate as to why, exactly, the Republican made this surprise announcement, but The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump’s relationship with Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel is starting to “thaw,” and Masters is a close Thiel ally. I have a hunch that won’t make Hamadeh feel any better about having to share the former president’s support. Primary Day in Arizona is just 24 hours away."
"Elon Musk’s 2024 electioneering reaches a new, unsettling level",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 5:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musks-2024-electioneering-reaches-new-unsettling-level-rcna164030,"In July 2019, Donald Trump and his White House team held an odd, official event, which was labeled a “Social Media Summit.” For all intents and purposes, “summit” vastly overstated matters: The then-president hung out with a group of right-wing media gadflies, all of whom whined for hours about a made-up conspiracy that, they believed, prevented their social-media content from becoming even more popular. A Washington Post analysis described it as a gathering in which Trump “invited some buds over to complain about how Twitter is mean to them.” As we discussed soon after, the Republican and his allies presented no evidence to substantiate their theories, but he nevertheless complained incessantly about tech CEOs and their “terrible bias“ against those on the right. At the same event, a variety of GOP lawmakers — Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Josh Hawley of Missouri, among others — talked up assorted bills and task forces that would uncover the conspiracy and require political “neutrality” from the tech giants. Not surprisingly, nothing ever came of such efforts, largely because the entire idea of the tech industry trying to undermine conservatives was ridiculous. Five years later, however, if Republicans are still looking for powerful tech executives displaying a partisan “bias,” I have some news they’ll be eager to see. The New York Times reported: The video — which Musk promoted, but does not appear to have created — took an actual Harris ad, removed images that were critical of Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance, and mimicked the Democratic vice president’s voice, making it seem as if Harris said things she neither said nor believes. The Times report added that the manipulated video did not contain any disclaimers; Musk did not disclose it as some kind of parody; and the video “would seem to run afoul of X’s policies, which prohibit sharing ‘synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.’” A day later, Musk, using the platform he now owns, described the likely Democratic presidential nominee as “an extinctionist,” adding that the effects of Harris’ political philosophy would lead to “a de facto holocaust for all of humanity!” What’s more, the Times reported a couple of weeks ago that Musk was “likely” to offer “significant” support for a new pro-Trump super PAC created by Musk’s closest friends. The Wall Street Journal had a related report, noting that the conspiratorial billionaire is prepared to spend “around $45 million a month” in the hopes of putting the Republican back in power. Musk later denied the accuracy of the reporting, though Trump personally suggested that Musk is, in fact, investing $45 million a month in support of his candidacy. And did I mention that Trump recently told an audience that he intends to “make life good” for Musk and people like him in a prospective second term? Because the Republican said exactly that nine days ago. The Trump White House’s “Social Media Summit” might’ve been more compelling if it had this kind of material to work with."
Trump tells supporters they ‘won’t have to vote’ again if he wins,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tells-supporters-wont-vote-wins-rcna164019,"Democratic arguments that Donald Trump represents a threat to American democracy appears to be the one criticism that the former president considers intolerable. In fact, the Republican has claimed without evidence that this Democratic talking point — which is rooted in fact — might very well have contributed to the recent assassination attempt. But if the GOP candidate doesn’t want to be seen as a threat to American democracy, he probably ought to stop taking public stances that make it seem as he’s a threat to American democracy. The New York Times reported: This might sound hyperbolic. It’s not. “Christians, get out and vote — just this time,” the Republican said at the Turning Point USA Believers Summit. “You won’t have to do it anymore! Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” For good measure, he went on say, “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” To be sure, the former president has made similar comments in the very recent past. Just last week, for example, Trump told a far-right audience, “In four years you don’t have to vote, ok? In four years don’t vote, I don’t care.” But his remarks from late Friday were even less subtle — and even more unsettling. If we’re being charitable, there is a potentially benign interpretation of the candidate’s comments, though even this is far from reassuring. Perhaps Trump meant that, at the end of his prospective second term, his far-right vision will be so entrenched in the American system that it will be effectively election-proof. MAGA world will endure for the indefinite future, the argument goes, so whether the Republican’s followers vote or not in 2028 will be irrelevant — because there will be nothing Democrats can do to reverse what’s been done. The less charitable interpretation is that Trump envisions a future without elections. Or as Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman put it, “The only way ‘you won’t have to vote anymore’ is if Donald Trump becomes a dictator.” The New York congressman’s choice of words was especially notable given that Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating what he’s pitched as a temporary American “dictatorship.” The former president has also talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, rejecting election results he doesn’t like, creating militarized camps, issuing pardons for politically aligned criminals, strengthening his friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, pursuing mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions, and arguing that his rivals shouldn't be ""allowed"" to run against him. On ABC News’ “This Week,” Martha Raddatz asked Gov. Chris Sununu — a former critic of the former president who’s now a cheerleader for his party’s ticket — about the former president’s “won’t have to vote anymore” comments. The New Hampshire Republican chuckled before responding, “I think that was a classic Trumpism.” Perhaps. But isn’t that precisely the problem?"

Kamala Harris ought to take the long view on her VP pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-vice-president-vp-choice-rcna163723,"Vice President Kamala Harris has rapidly emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now, the party is consumed with the next big question: Who should be her running mate? The prevailing wisdom in these debates, as articulated by countless pundits and political junkies, is that a presidential candidate must snag a VP who can “balance out the ticket” and ideally help secure a battleground state. In countless columns and social media posts, candidates are chiefly assessed — often through reference to brief cable news clips — on how they could help Harris edge out former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance on Election Day. I hope that the Harris camp does not succumb to such shallow and shortsighted thinking. Data gathered by political scientists indicates that VP picks have a very limited impact on the appeal of a presidential ticket. What matters most in the long term is recognizing how likely it is that a vice president could become a presidential candidate or president one day — and what this person might do with that power. The veepstakes is perhaps the ultimate catnip for pundits and political junkies in every presidential cycle, spurring innumerable takes on how a specific VP’s home state, rhetorical style, race, gender and vibe might complement the presidential candidate and help win over key constituencies. But political scientists have found that VP picks don't make much of a difference when it comes to elections. Take the claim that selecting a vice president can help a president secure the state they hail from in the election, which is central to the argument that a VP should come from a battleground state. The political scientists Kyle Kopko and Christopher Devine, who specialize in the electoral impact of vice presidential picks, studied over a century of election and voter data and found “a vice presidential candidate’s state of residence generally has no effect on how a presidential candidate performs in that state. The vice presidential home state advantage is, essentially, zero.” The one exception they found was that a VP pick from a state with a small population and who has established an exceptional reputation as “an institution in state politics” could confer some home-state advantage to the presidential ticket. But a small state is, by definition, rarely going to be a game changer in the Electoral College. (Moreover, most battleground states today are not small.) Kopko and Devine have also pointed out that there is little evidence that vice presidents deliver specific demographic groups. “We didn’t find evidence, for example, that Geraldine Ferraro or Sarah Palin attracted more women voters to their party’s ticket,” Kopko recently told The New Republic. “Nor did Mike Pence attract more evangelical voters.” They have found one exception to that trend: Harris, as Biden’s running mate, did have a measurable impact on the vote choice of Black, women and Black women voters. But that being said, the effect was very small, and may have been amplified by a perception of Biden as unusually old and/or a potential one-term president meant to take down then-President Trump. While data suggests that people’s vote choice or likelihood is rarely affected by a VP pick, Kopko and Devine have found that the nature of the choice does, to some extent, affect voter perception of the presidential candidate. So while Palin did not win women for Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008, she did dampen voter perception of his age and judgment. To be fair, there is an argument to be made that Harris’ VP pick matters more in this cycle than most because of the exceptional nature of her candidacy. Assuming she secures the nomination, she will have a strikingly short period of time to introduce herself as a presidential candidate, and perhaps her running mate will play a larger role in defining her campaign as a result. But while we cannot rule out the electoral significance of a VP pick at the margins in a tight race, those considerations must be weighed against something we know matters: A vice president is unusually likely to become a viable presidential candidate or president in the future. Close to one-third of U.S. presidents have served as vice presidents before. That's not including the vice presidents who have become a nominee and failed. The last and current election cycles alone are a reminder of how much vice presidents matter as potential future leaders. In the 2020 Democratic primaries, Biden’s name recognition and background as Barack Obama’s vice president were indispensable to his performance in national polls and securing key endorsements, which is why he became the establishment candidate that moderates consolidated behind and he won the nomination. And Harris is now the front-runner to win the nomination because she is effectively fulfilling her vice presidential duty as a backup president, and because she represents the simplest route to party unity. This is why Harris should take the long view in her selection. Asking “What kind of potential presidential candidate or president would this person be?” helps train the eye on qualities such as a running mate’s demonstrable competence and their ideological positions. Does a governor or lawmaker have a track record of getting things done legislatively or changing the way people think about policy? Do they know how to lead and generate a mandate? Do they have dexterity with coalition-building? Do their values and their attitudes toward American politics and economics match the direction of the party and the country? Do they have an instinct and a vision for how to push the country forward? Their charisma matters, but it should not be viewed purely through the prism of their serving as a perfect “attack dog” VP. This person could one day be an attack dog for the entire party. I prefer vice presidential picks who understand the Democratic Party is becoming more progressive and exhibit ambition toward that end. Politicians who can think not just technocratically but also about systems, and recognize we live in a populist moment where many people are craving sweeping change. It is all the more imperative as the next generation of MAGA politicians takes up somewhat more left-leaning economic positions which sporadically show openness to regulation and quasi-labor-friendly policy. Democrats should elevate leaders who can vigorously identify capitalist exploitation, elucidate the meaning of social democracy and can call out the ruse of right-wing populism. Incidentally, these kinds of politicians are often the kinds of people who give off good vibes on television — because they have their finger on the pulse of the country. A serious party would seek to elevate them."
Sean Grayson had a history full of red flags. Then he appeared at Sonya Massey’s door.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sonya-massey-sean-grayson-red-flags-rcna163551,"Sonya Massey, 36, called 911 at 12:50 a.m. July 6 to report noises outside her Springfield, Illinois, home. Within 15 minutes, two Sangamon County deputies arrived. According to bodycam video recorded by his partner, Deputy Sean Grayson rang the doorbell, knocked on the door and repeatedly identified himself as a deputy from the sheriff’s office, “the one you called.” After some delay, Massey opened the door. “Please don’t hurt me,” she said. He replied, “I won’t hurt you. You called us.” But within minutes, Grayson, who has now been fired and charged by a grand jury with first-degree murder, shot Massey dead. While bodycam video recorded how the deputies mishandled their interaction with Massey, Grayson’s work history suggests that the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office mishandled its hiring process and either ignored or didn’t see the red flags that warned against bringing him onto the force. He joined the Army in 2014 but left in 2016 for an unspecified “serious offense.” Court records show that Grayson twice pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, once while he was enlisted in the Army and once after he was out.  A spokesperson for Sangamon County said the sheriff’s office knew about both DUIs Grayson had pleaded guilty to. In addition, the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office position was his sixth law enforcement job since 2020. That’s not the work history of a law enforcement official I’d ever want to hire. Video shows that it was a calm scene after the two deputies entered Massey’s home and she sat on a sofa fumbling through her purse for the driver’s license they'd asked her for. Then he pointed toward a pot of water boiling in the kitchen and said, “We don’t need a fire while we’re here.” Grayson was right to recognize the danger there. But a marginally well-trained officer — or a cop with common sense — would never send a potential suspect away from him and toward a potentially dangerous object. This is especially relevant because video had previously captured her being asked, “Are you doing all right, mentally?” And she answered, “Yes, I took my medicine.” Her family says she’d had recent mental health struggles. Given her response to the question about her mental well-being, deputies knew — or they should have known — that she was being treated for a mental illness. By sending her away from him and toward the boiling pot, Grayson relinquished control of the situation and put himself, his partner and, obviously, Massey in harm’s way. “Right,” Massey said when Grayson said, “We don’t need a fire.” After she turned off the stove and started moving the pot to an adjacent sink, the deputies, still in the living room area, instinctively backed away. “Where are you going?” Massey asked. Laughing, Grayson responded: “Away from your hot, steaming water.” “Away from the hot, steaming water?” Massey replied in a light tone that reflected Grayson’s laughter. “Oh,” she continued, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Again, the tone strikes me as light, not threatening. “Huh?” “I rebuke you,” she repeated, “in the name of Jesus.” “You better f---in’ not,” Grayson snapped as he put his hand on his holstered weapon and threatened to shoot her and ordered her to “Drop the f---in’ pot!” “OK,” Massey said. “I’m sorry.” The living room was separated from the kitchen by a counter. Grayson moved around the counter to see her. Bodycam video shows her crouching lower, raising both hands to her head in disbelief or panic, then rising up slightly while holding up the pot in one hand. At this point, Grayson fired three times. His partner, who also drew his weapon, did not fire. “Yeah, I’m not taking f---ing boiling water to the f---ing head,” Grayson said after he’d shot Massey. When he called for EMS and backup, Grayson asked whether law enforcement had previously been called to Massey’s home over any mental health issues. Again, Grayson was released from the Army in 2016 for unspecified but serious misconduct. On his application for the Logan County, Illinois, Sheriff’s Office, where he worked from May 2022 to April 2023, he said he’d been intoxicated “a lot” in his life. A supervisor at the Virden, Illinois, Police Department reported that Grayson never resigned but one day just stopped showing up for his shifts. Auburn, Illinois, Police Department officials reported that he wrongly described his military discharge from the Army as “honorable” and that the department never sought to verify it. In Kincaid, Illinois, where he'd worked for the police department, a member of the Kincaid Board of Trustees described him as a “loose cannon … arrogant and cocky.” Sonya Massey was killed by an officer who drifted from one law enforcement job to another after leaving the Army after a serious offense. It doesn’t appear that any of the departments that hired him thoroughly vetted him. How could they have hired him if they had? Grayson killed Massey. But she was also the victim of a deeply flawed approach to human resources in the law enforcement agencies that employed him. I wish I could say this is an aberration in American law enforcement, but I can’t. Police agencies are generally understaffed and very often poorly staffed, which puts pressure on them to hire applicants they should turn away.   Then there’s the issue of training. A licensed plumber must have thousands of hours of training. The same for a licensed cosmetologist. A police officer? On average, fewer than 700. Indeed, the U.S. has among the lowest police training requirements in the world. It’s unclear what they were taught, but the way the deputies performed inside Massey’s home doesn’t reflect good training. We demand excellence in surgeons, nurses, airline pilots and others who have our lives in their hands, and in pursuit of that we require that they be vetted and trained. But when it comes to law enforcement, we make no such demands, and we seem unwilling to make the necessary investments. Standing at her door, all Massey asked was that Grayson not hurt her. Turns out, that was too much to ask."
"Why Vance’s ‘childless, cat ladies’ comment could come back to haunt him",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 5:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/vances-childless-cat-ladies-comment-come-back-haunt-rcna163864,"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is facing renewed criticism for saying the United States is run by ‘childless cat ladies.’ And political experts say such rhetoric could have disastrous effects on a demographic the GOP desperately needs to win in November: women. In a recently resurfaced interview with Fox News from 2021,  Vance, who at the time was running for Ohio’s Senate, let his feelings about childless women be known. “We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it’s just a basic fact if you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it.”  Women, however, will undoubtedly wield enormous influence in this year’s U.S. election. Yet, part of earning their vote is understanding their changing lifestyle choices. For example, in the U.S. there are more single women than ever before. Over half of women in the country are unmarried or separated, and a growing number of women are skipping motherhood entirely. By the age of 40, one in six women have never given birth. Unmarried women, turned out to be a key electorate for President Joe Biden in 2020. The majority -- 63 percent -- of unmarried women voted for Biden, compared to the 36 percent of those who voted for Trump. But instead of engaging this growing electorate of women, political experts said the right has decided to pose a sort of war with the exact demographic that could have a strong impact in November. Lauren Leader, co-founder and CEO of All In Together — a nonpartisan organization focused on engaging women voters — said the right has been at war with women on many fronts. From holding outdated beliefs of women and what their roles should be at home and at work, the far right has long thought of women as inferior, she argued. “…It’s always been a huge weakness for Republicans and part of why they have lost every election since 2016. But Trump has embraced the groups that push this.” What might not be evident to Vance is that the so-called ‘childless cat lady’ remark might be more aspirational than disparaging. From viral trends like the “cool aunt,” which celebrates the financial freedom and personal independence reaped by women without children of their own, to the data that shows women without children or spouses are the happiest subgroup in the population. Indeed, many single, childless women are flourishing. And contrary to Vance’s argument that these women having “no stake in America,” single women in the U.S. are contributing in a big way. Lauren Napier, founder of the SP1NSTER — a lifestyle brand that harnesses the collective spending power of single women — said “child-free women have money and time. There are trillions of dollars circulating the U.S. economy completely powered by single women. There’s even is a movement called “S.I.N.K.”, single income no kids.” Napier, who is child-free by choice, said she wouldn’t have it any other way. “It is no different than bachelorhood — which is revered. I have a very full life and I go to bed and wake up at my own pace. This weekend I am taking a French lesson and floral design class with a group of girlfriends. I have a date tomorrow night and I am headed out to a mixer this evening. If I decide to make a night of it, I can because I am my only obligation,” she shared. Vance’s “cat lady” comment, however, shows  a real disconnect with some women’s ability to have children in the first place, said political analyst and Republican consultant, Elise Jordan. “It’s a cruel, insensitive comment reflective of a judgmental worldview steeped in male ignorance. To ignore the intense grief of desiring a child and being unable to conceive shows a basic gap in one’s humanity. Women lucky enough not to suffer infertility have a friend or sister in their life who has struggled to conceive. Vance managed to throw salt in a universal wound for women and the men who love them,” said Jordan. Experts also pointed out the very real political and economic factors that influence a woman’s ability to have children: skyrocketing child care costs, cost of living, health care, abortion rights, and even maternal mortality rates. Vance’s unearthed comment was criticized by women who are child-free, often not by choice. For Ashley Reece, a 33-year-old writer in New York, having a child is something she wants. Reece — who also happens to be a proud cat owner — planned to have a child with her husband. But in 2022, he passed away from cancer. “For someone who has kind of made so much of their brand as being this well-rounded person going from rural beginnings to Harvard Law, you would think that this person would have a pretty diverse view of the world and the people within it,” said Reece who is a Democrat. “And for him to just kind of paint everyone who’s childless as some like miserable cat owner, who has no stake in the future... his views are a little more stunted than he he’d like to believe.”  Actress Jennifer Aniston, who doesn’t have biological children of her own, recently criticized Vance on her Instagram Stories, “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States. All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Jordan said Vance’s recent remarks and the Republican party’s continued efforts to restrict reproductive rights, will only hurt them politically come November. “Democrats should welcome a continued barrage of cruel comments as a political gift and easy cannon fodder. Access to life-saving medical care without government interference is an issue of basic human freedom. Any time Democrats can remind voters that elected Republicans inserted the government into the privacy and sanctity of personal healthcare decisions, they win politically.” Vance, however, defended his remarks about Democratic women during an interview with Megyn Kelly on Friday. “I know the media wants to attack me and wants me to back down on this, Megyn, but the simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way,” he said. “It’s not a criticism of people who don’t have children. I explicitly said in my remarks, despite the fact the media has lied about this, that this is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic party for becoming anti-family and anti-child,” he said.

"Stop being a Debbie Downer. Democrats need to lock in support for Harris, not step on it.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 7:16 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-harris-enthusiasm-carville-100-days-rcna163848,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 26 episode of “Morning Joe.” During an appearance on “The Beat,” veteran Democratic strategist James Carville told Ari Melber that members of his party were too enthusiastic about the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris: Gee, why such a Debbie Downer? The overwhelmingly positive response to the Harris candidacy is its own cause for celebration among Democrats who have been concerned by the state of the race for months. A strong campaign team can make great television ads or build a great field organization, but it can’t manufacture enthusiasm for your candidate. A fired-up base of supporters is the fuel that propels the most successful campaigns and — as one of the most heralded political strategists of the last three decades — Carville certainly knows this. I guess he’s just nervous about the onslaught of attacks that await the vice president.   You can be both enthusiastic about the Democrats’ new ticket and clear-eyed about the challenges Harris and her running mate will face. As someone who was on the front lines of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, I know I am. It’s going to get ugly and it’s going to be a slog, which is all the more reason why the vice president needs joyful warriors who will have her back during the brutal days ahead. So don’t be a buzzkill. We all need some positive vibes. Knowing of Carville’s anxiety about “preachy females” in the Democratic Party, I also have to wonder if his lamentations about Harris supporters being “giddy” and feeling “liberated” are directed at voters he assumes are elated by the notion of electing the first woman president. That’s not my motivation, nor was it during the 2016 campaign. I just thought Clinton was the best person for the job — which is how I feel this time with Harris. And I think women are extremely motivated to help the vice president now because our lives and those of our daughters and granddaughters are the most threatened by Donald Trump’s extreme agenda. I know firsthand the despair and disempowerment women have felt as we watched polls slip away toward a Trump landslide win. They had left us wondering if we had any agency in this country at all. Was it too late to save democracy or protect the young women and girls in this country? Now, we have a fighting chance to win. I think it’s that hope, that belief that it’s not too late and that there is something each of us can do to ward off a Trump win and secure victory for Harris that accounts for the massive show of support from women and men. Less than a week into her campaign, women and men both have undertaken historic organizing efforts and raised millions of dollars for her. The vice president has shown she’s more than ready for this fight, and that’s inspired us to rally behind her in a very big way. We feel a responsibility to get her elected and empowered to get the job done. Given the dark weeks that preceded this moment, it feels liberating."
Why Trump’s attacks on Kamala Harris will be much nastier than usual,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-attacks-racism-sexism-rcna163313,"We’re 100 days out from the general election, and if you think Kamala Harris’ candidacy as the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee is unprecedented, wait until you see the unprecedentedly vicious and ugly attacks against her. Of course, former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are always nasty work; that’s to be expected from a loud-mouthed, racist, sexist, petty, congenital liar of a candidate. But Trump has always singled out Black women for his most denigrating abuse. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of misogynoir, which describes the coupled misogyny and racism thrown at Black women, please familiarize yourself, stat, because this election season will be lousy with it. Now that the felonious ex-president must face off against Harris — a biracial Black woman and erstwhile prosecutor nearly 20 years his junior — we’re already seeing disgusting assaults on the vice president’s character that aren’t remotely based in fact. Remember those vile T-shirts, popular with Trump’s supporters earlier in the campaign, that read, “Joe and the Ho Gotta Go”? Expect even more hypersexualization toward Harris by Trump, his surrogates and his MAGA followers. They’re alleging Harris “slept her way to the top” — as Megyn Kelly claimed — referencing her relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who had been separated from his wife for over a decade when he and Harris dated 30 years ago. Those falsehoods are also being paired with claims that Harris is a “DEI hire,” a repurposing of “diversity, equity and inclusion” favored by conservatives who are too media-savvy to use overt slurs. Before becoming multiple firsts as vice president and in Congress, Harris was elected the first woman, first African American and first South Asian attorney general in California history, and served as San Francisco’s first woman and nonwhite district attorney. Her track record easily beats the allegations, but when she proves her rhetorical and intellectual competence against Trump, which will be fun to watch, they’ll try to portray her as a “typical angry Black lady.” These bad-faith allegations will be lodged by people who believe Blackness and womanness, regardless of resume, are inherent markers of unfitness. The terms “militant,” “radical,” “California socialist” and “Marxist” will be in heavy rotation, and Trump’s team will claim Harris, as president, will defund every police department and encourage mass migration to let undocumented immigrants vote in elections for Democrats. Just this week, in fact, Trump advisers boasted to The Bulwark of their strategic plan to “Willie Horton” Harris, a reference to racist campaign ads during the 1988 presidential campaign appealing to white panic over perceptions of Black criminality, which portrayed then-Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as lenient on violent offenders. That messaging will go hand in hand with fearmongering about immigration, with the GOP repeatedly claiming Harris failed as the Biden administration’s “border czar” — a title she never held, which the GOP made up and a complicit media helped proliferate. Numerous Republicans have filed impeachment articles against Harris since she became the presumptive nominee, and they’ll continue in this vein because their base loves a good show, however performative. Their own party thwarted a border security bill early this year because Trump wanted to run on immigration chaos. In any case, border crossings have fallen hugely in recent months, and currently stand near where they were in the final months under Trump’s watch. The Republican Party’s boundless hypocrisy means they’ll contradict themselves at every turn. The same partisans who wanted you to believe Harris slept her way to the top of a major-party ticket will also portray her as a childless, careerist feminazi whose hatred for America’s family model is surpassed only by her passion for funding post-birth abortions. Regardless of how she handles the Israel-Hamas war, some of the same Republicans known to dabble in antisemitism will claim Harris — the first Biden administration official to call for a cease-fire, but also a consistent defender of Israel’s “right to defend itself” — is stridently anti-Jewish. While using a super-racist nickname like, say, “Kamala X,” they’ll insist her Jamaican and Indian immigrant parentage makes her neither Black nor American — a reconfiguring of the racist “birtherism” directed at President Barack Obama. (Misogynoir being what it is, they may also falsely suggest, as they do with former first lady Michelle Obama, that she isn’t really a woman.) She’ll be cast as lax on crime, but also labeled “Kamala the cop,” and since they think Black people are gullible, criminal morons, Trump will trot out rappers while surrogates celebrate his felonies as proof he’s Blacker than Harris. Vivek Ramaswamy and every Black Republican will obligingly repeat these lines to defang any racism accusations. But the most insidious claim of all will be that Harris cannot win. Not only will this messaging come from Trump and Co., but also from lots of other sources. Paid disinformation agents in Russia, which targeted Black voters most intensely in 2016. Red-pilled American trolls clad in digital blackface. And it’ll come from mainstream reporters concern-trolling about her campaign’s divisiveness, or a New York Times article where rural diner patrons are polled on the “scariest” things about Kamala Harris. The result will be a lot of people saying they want to vote for Harris, but they worry that no one else will. But the stats are currently on Harris’ side. In the 48 hours after Harris became the Dems’ presidential nominee, ActBlue raised $81 million, one of its highest one-day tallies in history. Politico reported that during the first 48 hours of her candidacy, Vote.org saw a 700% spike in voter registrations, which outpaces the increase that resulted from a Taylor Swift social media post. Calls organized for Black women, South Asian women, white women, Latinas, Black men and Black LGBTQ men have raised funds and helped galvanize those communities. Harris’ support among Black and Hispanic voters has bested that of Biden’s, by 8% and 6%, respectively. Polls can be fickle things, but the first Reuters/Ipsos poll since Harris became the candidate has her leading Trump, 44% to 42%. The point is, she can absolutely win. Over the next 100 days, we’re going to see horrifying levels of racism and sexism — misogynoir, that is — and it will be terrifyingly mainstream. But don’t give up hope. Vice President Harris has what it takes to beat back those representing the worst instincts of America. She just needs our votes to make it happen."
Biden’s exit is a boost for congressional Democrats’ chances,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-house-democrats-election-brighter-chances-rcna163311,"President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race was precipitated by a number of factors, but perhaps most strongly by waning support from Capitol Hill Democrats. From Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to senior House Democrats and those in competitive districts, Biden’s support from party insiders collapsed. Their thinly veiled fears were that Biden would not only lose to former President Donald Trump, but would potentially deliver historic losses for Democrats in Congress. As MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki observed about the president’s standing in national polls upon his withdrawal, these were polling theories that will never be tested. But what we do know is congressional Democrats have now been untethered from one of the great questions that had been facing them in November. No longer are House Democrats forced off message by having to defend the personal fitness of their presidential candidate. They can now clearly run on their agenda for the American people and can prosecute the political case against congressional Republicans. That opportunity has House Democrats excited, and rightfully so. Consider the Republicans’ chaotic term in the congressional majority. They started this 118th Congress unable to elect a speaker of the House. They failed at the basic functions of funding the government, addressing the nation’s debt ceiling and supporting our international alliance opposing Vladimir Putin and Russian aggression. At each of these most critical junctures, it was House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and House Democrats who stepped up and governed, delivering the majority of votes for Congress to function and execute its constitutional responsibilities. The Republican response to these episodes of responsible Democratic leadership was to then topple their own House speaker and plunge the House into renewed leadership chaos before finally arriving at the hard-right Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republicans have also governed this Congress largely devoid of any real agenda for the American people. They spent a year flirting with impeaching Biden and chasing his son Hunter Biden time and again — embarrassing themselves with deflated conspiracy theories. They formed a government weaponization committee to attack federal and state prosecutors otherwise lawfully executing their duties to seek indictments of Trump. In fact, many Republican members skipped out on their official duties in Congress in humiliating fashion, donning blue suits and red ties and rushing to the Manhattan courtroom where their political leader was eventually convicted of 34 felony counts. Voters would be right to wonder what congressional Republicans have done for them these past two years. Democrats, by contrast, are anxious to offer their vision to the American people — protect Social Security and Medicare, defend reproductive freedom, and fight growing economic inequality made worse by Republican tax and tariff proposals. Democrats want to share their vision for lowering prescription drug costs, securing access to health care and education for more Americans and continuing investments in infrastructure and technology. And on foreign policy, Democrats accept responsibility for defending our interests abroad just as strongly as they defend them here at home. House Democrats now go into November on a very firm foundation, and the polls show it. In a recent memo from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Democratic House candidates continue to strongly outperform their Republican opponents in fundraising and polling, and these trends are most importantly seen in their most critical races — the most competitive majority-making congressional seats, what Democrats call their “Frontline” races. Incumbent Democratic House members in Frontline districts now lead their Republican opponents by an average of 8 points, and these Democratic members enjoy a net favorability rating of 10 points. For Democratic candidates trying to flip currently held Republican seats in competitive districts, they are polling ahead or tied in virtually every district targeted by House Democrats, and their net favorability is a strong 7 points. Democrats are on message, Republicans are out of touch, and the American people are paying attention. House Democrats are poised to regain control of Congress. The last month of Democratic hand-wringing over Biden’s disastrous debate performance understandably distracted the nation, and it consumed the president’s party. Although polling showed no statistical change to Democrats’ standing in Congress following the debate in Atlanta, the national conversation certainly changed. It was the reason Pelosi, Schumer and others expressed such panic. That chapter is now over. House Democrats are back, and their message is clear: Vote blue to secure your fundamental rights and ensure an economy and America for all people. Democrats believe the choice is a clear one for voters. They would be right to feel enthusiastic about their prospects in November."
Why Democrats feel confident about holding the Senate in November,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-senate-election-2024-rcna163877,"In Montana, a third-generation dirt farmer will face a dishonest, rich out-of-stater that real Montanans call a “wannabe cowboy.” In Ohio, a lifelong champion for workers is running against a deceitful car salesman who was successfully taken to court for wage theft, while media outlets have reported he’s playing fast and loose with his own biography on the campaign trail. In Arizona, the choice will be between a Marine who has defended our country and Kari Lake, who seems only interested in defending her power-mad lie that she won an election the courts said she lost. Matches like these are playing out in every Senate race in states across the country. It doesn’t seem like Senate Republicans are sending their best. As chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during our history-defying and victorious 2022 campaign cycle, and as the winner of tough elections in Michigan, I know that voters view Senate races as a battle between candidates. And one thing Mitch McConnell and I agree on is that candidate quality matters. Each of our races will be close. We have a big map this year. But 100 days out, I have never been more confident that Democrats are in the strongest possible position to defend our Senate majority thanks to the strength of our candidates, the power of their campaigns and the weakness of Republican recruits. In each of our races, I believe our Democratic candidate will win because they can attract a diverse coalition of voters. For months, they’ve been communicating with voters about their values, accomplishments and plans to continue fighting for the priorities that matter most to the people in their states. But the most important reason I believe Senate Democrats will win is because voters recognize the stakes of this election and that Senate Democrats are on their side when it comes to the issues that matter most to their lives: protecting women’s freedom to make their own decisions about their health care, cracking down on big corporations that get rich by keeping prices high, keeping good-paying jobs in America, securing the border and standing against the attacks Republicans have pledged to mount against Medicare, Social Security and the Affordable Care Act. We have a lot of work to do between now and November. It will require resources and grassroots energy. And when we do this work, in 100 days I am confident that Senate Democrats will have successfully defended our majority, because we have better candidates, stronger campaigns and a winning message."
The history I share with Sonya Massey makes me grieve her death even more,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sonya-massey-william-donnegan-lynched-rcna163511,"According to the family of Sonya Massey, the 36-year-old mother of two shot dead by an Illinois sheriff’s deputy July 6, she was a descendant of William K. Donnegan, who’d been a shoemaker and conductor on the Underground Railroad before he was lynched by a white mob during the Springfield Race Riot in 1908. Massey, they say, died at the same hospital, St. John’s, where Donnegan died after his white attackers slit his throat and hanged him from a tree outside his home. Like Massey, I am the descendant of a Black man who was lynched. My great-grandfather, Burt Bridges, was hanged from a tree in Mississippi in 1904. His son, Houston Buckley, whom I called Papa, never knew his father, as he was born after that murder. In the 1980s, when I was a child and Papa was in his early 80s, I saw him sitting in his old, green recliner in the living room, his head in his hands and sobbing: “Them white folks lynched my daddy.” Grandmama couldn’t have known when she married the young Houston that he would be mourning his murdered father even in his final years. From the doorway of the kitchen that day, she urged him to pull himself together and to “leave the past in the past.” Yet the past has an ugly way of refusing to stay in its place. It took 20 years for me to publish “We Are Bridges,” a memoir I wrote to examine how this violent part of our past had impacted my family through the generations, to attempt to heal the fractured parts of me and to pass on the stories of our ancestors — including their beauty, laughter and talents — to my son and generations not yet born. It is, admittedly, a lofty attempt at bridging the past, present and future. It is my personal contribution to an ongoing battle against racism and patriarchy. And yet, as I wrote and revised the manuscript over the years, the ugliest parts of the past kept trying to outpace whatever progress there was. With one eye on the news and one on my developing manuscript, I tried to make sense of the unjust killings of Black people — Sean Bell, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, Philando Castile, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd — happening in real time. On my way home from work last week, a craving for homemade nachos hit me like a head-on collision. It wasn’t until I was standing over my cutting board, chopping up onion and garlic for beans, that the source of the sudden longing dawned on me:  Sonya Massey. I had watched Massey’s son, Malachi, tell a CBS News reporter how much he loved his mother’s food and describe her as a loving “ball of energy.” And I’d read an article that mentioned one of her cousins praising her shredded chicken nachos. As I ate the food I made, I felt an ache that seemed to stretch across time and space. This craving, I realized, represented an insatiable demand for law enforcement to stop carrying out this country’s legacy of lynching. After responding to Massey’s 911 call about a possible prowler outside her home in Springfield, Illinois, Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy Sean Grayson shot and killed Massey while she was in her kitchen. Her kitchen. That place from which she created culinary joy for herself and her loved ones. Bodycam footage shows that Grayson, who has been fired and is charged with first-degree murder, sent her to the kitchen to turn off a pot of boiling water. My ears burned at his profanity-laced threats to shoot her in the face and the popping of his pistol as he did just that. He shot her as she held the pot. She was a 36-year-old Black mother whose family loved her, but Grayson killing her shows he could not see her humanity. Maybe it’s just a coincidence that incidents such as these keep happening in presidential election years. George Floyd, 2020; Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, 2016. Trayvon Martin, 2012. Massey, 2024. Her ancestor, Donnegan, and my great-grandfather, Burt Bridges, were lynched in presidential election years, too. I’m not saying there is a connection — only that these are not unprecedented times and that these crimes have often happened in the years we’re spending the most time thinking about the future of our country. As a survivor of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow (we are here, after all), I am disgusted and dismayed, but never shocked by the domestic and racial terrorism that continues to pervade the “free world.” I have grown weary of writing about and talking about these injustices, but with each fatal shooting, beating and chokehold, my great-grandfather’s name rings out to me. This problem is not one for Black people to fix. We are done. The work of understanding the complexities of systemic violence, and eradicating it, sits squarely on the shoulders of people like Grayson and the institutions that empower them. After watching the footage of Massey being killed, the volcanic buildup of a deep, long and ugly cry surged from my belly to my chest. I planted my face down into a bath towel I was holding and howled as loud as I could. My tears were not just my own. I was crying for and with Donna Massey, who broke down in tears in that CBS News interview, under the unbearable grief of losing her daughter. I was crying with and for my papa, too."
The polls send a clear message about Kamala Harris. But that’s not the full story.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 27, 2024, 9:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/can-kamala-harris-beat-donald-trump-polls-rcna163225,"When President Joe Biden announced that he had chosen to drop out of the race after a messy debate performance followed by an equally chaotic month, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee in his stead, Harris quickly racked up endorsements from major party figures and a majority of delegates. Barring any major development, she will be the Democratic nominee this fall. Many Democrats saw this passing of the baton as a key moment to redefine a campaign in which the president had been lagging behind. For months, former President Donald Trump had led Biden in polling, both nationally and especially in critical swing states needed to win the presidency. Now an important question arises: Is Harris a stronger candidate than Biden? Ever since Harris’ kickoff of her 2020 presidential campaign, there have been a number of concerns that she would not be a particularly strong candidate. In fact, her campaign ended before the Iowa caucuses, which critics point to as an example of her weakness as a candidate. And her performance in polls against Trump often trailed behind other Democrats’, including Biden’s. But as the 2024 campaign ramped up, there were signs of Harris’ increasing strength — or perhaps Biden’s growing vulnerabilities. Last fall, a New York Times/Siena College poll found Harris slightly outpolled Biden in swing states, thanks to her relative strength with Democratic-leaning groups with whom Biden had shown unprecedented weaknesses. These voters, often young and nonwhite, backed Democratic candidates for Congress and Harris, but not Biden. In the 2020 primary, Biden often outperformed all of his rival Democrats in polls against Trump. But after Biden’s June debate performance, a flurry of polls that measured both Biden and Harris have been decidedly more mixed. For our analysis, we will examine seven post-debate national polls that were conducted by “select pollsters” that meet The New York Times’ standard  for high-quality analysis, plus an additional national poll conducted by Split Ticket/Data for Progress. Of these eight, Harris outperformed Biden in two, ran even with him in two, but performed worse than him in four. Only one poll found the difference between the candidates to be greater than 2 points in either direction. On the state level, what limited evidence we have is similarly mixed. The New York Times and Siena College conducted a poll in Pennsylvania and Virginia that found Harris outrunning Biden by 2 points in both states. An Emerson College poll of Virginia, however, found no difference between the candidates. Unfortunately, those three polls are the extent of high-quality state polls since the June 27 debate. From the polls reviewed, it can be concluded that Harris performs better than Biden, particularly due to strength with young voters and nonwhite voters, two Democratic-leaning groups that have been hesitant in supporting the president but not in their support for the vice president (and some other Democrats). Despite this small polled overperformance, Harris, like Biden, still polls behind Trump. In the past few weeks, Trump led Biden in polls of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, albeit narrowly, while in Sun Belt states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, Trump’s advantage ballooned out into the upper single digits, thanks to his newfound polled strength with previously Democratic nonwhite voters. Even if Harris gained a point or two over Biden in all six states, she would still be reliant on a narrow path to the presidency that is conditional on sweeping the three Midwest swing states. But Harris gaining equally in all six states is not likely; in fact she is more likely to gain in the Sun Belt, where disaffected Democrats are younger and less white than in the Rust Belt. This makes any coalitional gains for her even less efficient than they might appear. More specifically, even if Harris’ strength with these disengaged voters is real, she would have an outsize impact only in the states where Biden’s numbers have already put Democrats in a very weak position. A surge in nonwhite support would, by contrast, have a far more limited effect in Michigan or Wisconsin, meaning Harris may be put in a position where she narrowly falls short of victory in the the Sun Belt despite considerable gains, while the Rust Belt result versus Biden’s hypothetical November performance remains almost unchanged. There’s also a case to be made that the president is the stronger candidate. Although Biden has since bowed out of the race, and almost certainly will not return to the ticket, we shouldn’t ignore some of his unique strengths that Harris may not share. He had already demonstrated his ability to defeat Trump once in 2020; and his poll numbers among white voters and the elderly were on par with those from his 2020 victory — at times, better than what Harris saw. In fact, the groups he had slipped the most with were core Democratic groups, ones that would be most easily goaded back into the coalition as November drew nearer, and the possibility of a second Trump presidency could have been an effective rallying cry for the incumbent president. It is entirely possible that the advantages enjoyed by Harris are simply through winning a greater share of voters who would have “come home” to either candidate. We may never know the answer, but July came to a close with little evidence that these voters had begun the process of returning to Biden — which is why Harris would occasionally outperform him in polls. The strongest case for Biden, then, was that he had already established a “good” baseline among voters least friendly to Democrats, and that his catastrophic numbers with young and nonwhite voters was something of a mirage that would disappear by Election Day. In polling so far, Harris’ strengths relative to Biden’s mostly come from the latter group. Biden also demonstrated regional strength in Northeastern states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Maine, where many counties swung toward Trump in 2016, but then back toward Democrats when Biden was on the ticket in 2020. This helped deliver a decisive win for Biden in states where Hillary Clinton lost or came close to losing in 2016. As a former senator from California, Harris is much less likely to enjoy the same regional advantages Biden did in a part of the country with more swing states. But the case for Harris is less about existing polls, which were asking an entirely hypothetical question of voters up until the Sunday Biden resigned. Instead, Harris gives Democrats an opportunity rarely afforded to a party at this point in the year: a chance to reset the campaign. In fact, Harris’ potential to re-energize disaffected Democrats could also go undetected by polls. Because polls depend on a representative model of the electorate, a poll based on a Biden-Trump model could miss disengaged Democrats who would vote for Harris, but not Biden, potentially understating her true strength with the electorate. These demoralized Democrats could be skipping out on Biden for a number of reasons ranging from his age, which is broadly a concern for all voters, to his handling of the conflict in the Middle East, which is criticized by progressive Democrats, or his association by the electorate with double-digit percentage price increases since his inauguration, which is generally under scrutiny from moderate Democrats. Harris is not fully burdened by these factors, and as a breakout candidate, can more freely define herself to voters across the political spectrum dissatisfied with the Biden presidency. Biden’s campaign had hoped that its poll numbers would turn around as public awareness of Trump’s many liabilities, ranging from election denialism to his dozens of convictions, increased. Instead, the past month has largely revolved around Biden’s age and fitness for office. Harris, at 59, is unlikely to be dogged by this particular issue, and may even be successful in making Trump’s age, at 78, an issue for the former president. But most importantly, Harris can clearly and cogently prosecute the Democrats’ case against Trump, unburdened by Biden’s personal liabilities. She may have a number of her own, and as vice president has already inherited the Biden administration’s unpopularity. It is also possible that she ends up becoming an even less popular figure than Biden, and her strength relative to him revealed to be a mirage. This does not invalidate previous conclusions made from polling top lines, but instead means that Harris may offer Democrats a better chance than Biden to change the party’s polling woes, and to fulfill their original goal of making the election a choice between themselves and Trump — instead of a referendum on Biden. Although a Harris candidacy may introduce more uncertainties to the Democratic ticket, including a yet-unknown vice presidential nominee, when one is falling behind in a contest, the greater variability a fresh face can bring is exactly what’s needed to secure a win."
