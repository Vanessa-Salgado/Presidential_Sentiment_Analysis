"Fearing a ‘shadow government,’ Comer issues new anti-Biden subpoenas",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 9:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shadow-government-comer-biden-subpoenas-2024-election-rcna161575,"In the wake of the presidential debate two weeks ago, congressional Republicans eyed a variety of steps to capitalize on President Joe Biden’s poor showing. Some, for example, pushed the White House Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and end the Democratic incumbent’s term. Others raised the prospect of a new House select committee that would focus entirely on Biden’s fitness for office. But it was House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer who, in the wake of his embarrassing impeachment crusade, seemed especially excited to go after his white whale in a new way. This past weekend, for example, the Kentucky Republican requested that Biden’s physician appear before lawmakers for a transcribed interview about the president’s health. A few days later, as Axios reported, Comer turned his sights on a different group of people close to Biden. Specifically, Comer this week issued subpoenas to Anthony Bernal, a top aide to first lady Jill Biden, as well as deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and senior adviser Ashley Williams. And why, pray tell, did the Oversight Committee chair subpoena these three relatively unknown officials in particular? As it happens, Comer appeared on Newsmax and explained his perspective. “Our research indicates that these are the three people that have been pulling the strings for quite some time in the White House,” the beleaguered congressman said. These are the three people that have been trying to cover up the fact that Joe Biden hasn’t been mentally or physically able to perform the job of president ... These three people, their names keep popping up as the gatekeepers, in addition to Hunter Biden.” Comer added, “Have these three no-name employees — have they been operating a shadow government? Have they been privy to classified information? Do they have national security clearance? Have they been ordering the Cabinet secretaries to do various job duties?” I suppose the obvious joke here is that if this trio of “no-name employees” have been secretly running the federal branch of the world’s pre-eminent superpower, then Bernal, Tomasini and Williams have been doing a terrific job. But the truth is that Comer’s latest conspiratorial gambit isn’t a joking matter, and Oversight Committee subpoenas shouldn’t target White House officials just because its hapless chairman is looking for a new toy after his impeachment effort failed spectacularly. Indeed, if the Kentucky Republican has any evidence of these staffers “operating a shadow government,” he’s kept it to himself, making his subpoenas sound an awful lot like a fishing expedition. Nevertheless, if Biden stays in the 2024 race, we can expect more of this in the coming weeks and months. Comer reportedly asked the aides to respond to his subpoenas by July 17, and he wants them to participate in closed-door interviews later this month. Watch this space."

Read: Hakeem Jeffries' letter to colleagues about his meeting with Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 8:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffries-biden-meeting-house-democrat-leader-document-pdf-rcna161546,"House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a letter to his colleagues on Friday that he met with President Joe Biden to discuss his caucus members' ""conclusions about the path forward"" amid the president's embattled re-election campaign. The New York Democrat said he met with Biden in person on Thursday evening and ""directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions"" shared by his caucus. The conversation took place as Biden faces pressure from some prominent Democrats, including more than a dozen members of the House, to drop out of the 2024 race. Those urging him to withdraw have cited concerns about his weak debate performance last month and his chances of beating Donald Trump in November. In his letter, Jeffries doesn’t indicate whether he urged Biden to drop out or encouraged him to stay in the race, or how his message was received by the president. Instead, he notes toward the end of his letter that House Democrats ""will continue to work in the best interests of everyday Americans."" Read Jeffries' letter below:"
U.S. foils alleged Russian assassination plot as Trump eyes new intel limits,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 8:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-foils-alleged-russian-assassinate-plot-trump-eyes-new-intel-limits-rcna161547,"Those interested in national security and international intelligence were confronted by two important headlines yesterday, which were connected in ways that might not be immediately obvious. The first came by way of NBC News, which noted that U.S. and German authorities uncovered and thwarted an alleged Russian plot to assassinate the CEO of a major German arms manufacturer. That last sentence was of particular interest. Intelligence officials in the United States uncovered the alleged Russia plot, informed our NATO allies in Berlin, and German officials were able to intervene. It’s the sort of critically important cooperation that strengthens our relationships abroad and saves lives. All of which leads us to the second report of interest. Politico reported that foreign officials have been informed that Donald Trump is “considering a reduction in intelligence sharing with members of NATO.” So, a few things. First, the fact that these two reports ran on the same day was rather extraordinary. On the one hand, the world was confronted with fresh evidence of the importance of the U.S. sharing intelligence with our NATO allies; while on the other hand, the world was simultaneously confronted with news that Trump intends to curtail sharing intelligence with our NATO allies. It’s difficult to say how many American voters will consider such an issue when weighing their presidential election choices, but it’s the sort of news that raises the stakes even higher. Second, the idea that the Republican and his team would deliberately take steps to reduce intelligence sharing with U.S. allies is dangerously bonkers. Indeed, the Politico report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that many countries depend on the U.S. “for the type of information that has helped Ukraine fend off Russia.” The article added, “The curtailment of intel could have dire security consequences, especially for Ukraine as it tries to repel the Russian invasion.” Former CIA Director John Brennan summarized matters this way: “Intelligence sharing among NATO members and with Ukraine has been absolutely essential to counter Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine as well as to uncover and thwart other destabilizing Russian activities in Europe and beyond. A cutoff or significant scaling back of U.S. intelligence sharing with NATO allies and partners would have an immediate, profound, and potentially long lasting adverse impact on Western security interests.” In other words, Team Trump’s intentions are the sort of plan that Vladimir Putin would love, but U.S. allies would hate. Finally, if the former Republican president is serious about “a reduction in intelligence sharing,” maybe he can start by blurting out fewer classified secrets?"
"GOP’s Grothman slams ‘angry feminist movement,’ seeks return to 1960s",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 7:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-grothman-slams-angry-feminist-movement-seeks-return-1960s-rcna161534,"Rep. Glenn Grothman has earned a reputation as a politician who speaks his mind — though he probably shouldn’t. It was a few years ago, for example, when the Wisconsin Republican argued that the District of Columbia doesn’t deserve statehood because it doesn’t have any local mining. That came on the heels of Grothman explaining his opposition to equal-pay legislation by saying, “You could argue that money is more important for men.” Around the same time, he reportedly criticized sex-ed classes because, as Grothman put it, some gay teachers “would like it if more kids became homosexuals.” Last year, the GOP congressman expressed concern that by diversifying the courts, President Joe Biden might be “actively discriminating against white heterosexual men.” Soon after, Grothman lamented the lack of “white guys” among the White House’s judicial nominees. Unfortunately, he’s still at it. The Daily Beast reported: Even by contemporary Republican standards, Grothman’s remarks, delivered on the House floor from what appeared to be prepared notes, were striking. The Wisconsin lawmaker initially claimed that Lyndon Johnson’s agenda “took the purpose out of the man’s life, because now you have a basket of goodies for the mom.” Grothman added, “They’ve taken away the purpose of the man to be part of a family. And if we want to get America back to, say, 1960, where this was almost unheard of, we have to fundamentally change these programs.” After criticizing a variety of social-insurance programs — including day care and pre-school — and denouncing “the angry feminist movement,” the Republican concluded, “So I hope the press corps picks up on this, and I hope Republican and Democrat [sic] leadership put together some sort of plan for January, in which we work our way back to where America was in the 1960s.” In 2020, it’s worth noting for context, Axios published a report ranking Donald Trump’s top loyalists on Capitol Hill. Grothman claimed the top spot at #1. I mention this because the former president is defined in large part by his retrospective perspective. Trump isn’t forward thinking; he boasts about his desire to go backwards, to a time when he thinks America was “great.” And while the presumptive GOP presidential nominee tends to be vague about just how far back he wants to roll back the clock, his congressional sycophant was more explicit: Grothman doesn’t just want to go back four years, to Trump’s term; he wants to go back six decades, to a time when people who looked and thought like him enjoyed a more exalted status over everyone else. The Republican congressman keeps running for re-election, even after he broke his term-limits pledge, and his Wisconsin constituents keep sending him back to Capitol Hill. In fact, in the 2022 midterm elections cycle, he won 95% of the vote — because literally no local Democrat was willing to run against him."
Many fake electors welcomed as delegates at Republican convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-fake-electors-election-delegates-republican-convention-rcna161524,"After Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020, Republicans in several states created forged election materials, pretending to be “duly elected and qualified electors,” and sent the documents to, among others, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Archivist, as if the fake materials were legitimate. They were not. These Republicans came to be known as their party’s “fake electors.” The larger criminal scandal surrounding their scheme has racked up indictment totals unseen since Watergate and Iran-Contra. With this in mind, it’s tempting to think that GOP officials would feel a degree of embarrassment about the entire controversy. Indeed, common sense might suggest that the recent indictments against fake electors would make these Republicans politically radioactive. Apparently, it’s not quite working out that way. We learned in May, for example, that several fake electors in Nevada were elected to serve as delegates to the Republican National Convention, even after they were criminally charged. “Clearly, lessons learned,” The Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston said sarcastically in response to the news. A month earlier, state prosecutors in Arizona indicted 18 Republicans as part of the party’s fake elector scheme, resulting in allegations of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. Some of them will be convention delegates, too. After the state GOP made the decision, The Arizona Republic’s Laurie Roberts summarized in a column: “The Arizona Republican Party on Saturday sent a flat out, full-throated, flabbergasting message to the voters of this great state. We be crazy, they proclaimed.” Nevertheless, those delegates apparently have some company. CNN reported this week: According to CNN’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the delegates will represent key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin. It’s worth emphasizing that not all of the fake electors who’ll serve as convention delegates are currently under criminal indictment — but some are, and the party doesn’t seem to care. Indeed, CNN’s report added, “Their role underscores how Trump has effectively woven election denialism into the GOP’s platform.” The same piece quoted former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger as saying, “Election denialism is like the price of entry now. ... These people that were in the fake elector scheme, or got a mug shot, they’re now the heroes of the movement, and they’ve taken over the party.” As the indictments piled up, it seemed implausible that GOP officials would extend rewards to those who were caught serving as fake electors. And yet, here we are."
Great economic news overshadowed by debate over Biden’s fate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/great-economic-news-overshadowed-debate-bidens-fate-rcna161515,"Those keeping a close eye on U.S. economic data had reason to celebrate yesterday morning. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ new report on the Consumer Price Index showed that price increases slowed sharply last month — including the first month-to-month decline in more than four years. The news not only offered fresh evidence that the United States has succeeded in getting inflation under control, it also opened the door to the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in September, giving Americans a boost ahead of November’s election. Not surprisingly, the White House was eager to tout the good news. President Joe Biden issued a statement that read in part: That quote at the end of the paragraph was in reference to a New York Times report, published this week, that read, “America’s so-called ‘left behind’ counties — the once-great manufacturing centers and other distressed places that struggled mightily at the start of this century — have staged a remarkable comeback. In the last three years, they added jobs and new businesses at their fastest pace since Bill Clinton was president.” This is not the only encouraging news on the economic front. The job market remains strong; wages are up; and the stock market continues to reach new heights. What’s more, there’s an international context to consider. The World Bank last month not only noted that the Biden-era economy is the world’s strongest, it also concluded that the global economy is in better shape in large part because of the United States’ recovery. “Globally, overall things are better today than they were just four or five months ago,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. “A big part of this has to do with the resilience of the U.S. economy.” Gill’s report further credited “U.S. dynamism” with helping to stabilize economies abroad. A Washington Post report added, “The United States is the only advanced economy growing significantly faster than the bank anticipated at the start of the year.” Around the same time, The Atlantic's Rogé Karma described the U.S. economy as “the envy of the world.” Four years ago, Donald Trump told supporters that Democratic policies would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” Everything he said and predicted was wrong — and the former president hasn’t even tried to explain why his predictions were so hilariously misplaced. And yet, a newly released ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll found Trump with a double-digit lead over Biden on whom voters trust more on the economy. There’s a larger conversation about why such public attitudes persist, but there’s also a more immediate problem for the White House and the Democratic Party. As a Semafor report noted this week, “If not for the brutal aftermath of Joe Biden’s debate debacle, Democrats might have spent the last couple of weeks celebrating some reassuring economic news.” Instead, it appears that the great news on the economy has been overshadowed by the debate over Biden’s 2024 fate to such an extent that much of country hasn’t heard about it at all. Making matters worse, it’s easy to imagine how the economic news will be incorporated into the intraparty fracas. One side of the Democratic divide will likely point to the great economic news and say, “See? Biden is a highly successful president who obviously deserves a second term! With results like these, it’d be absurd to push him off the Democratic ballot!” At that point, the other side of the Democratic divide will likely point to the identical data and say, “See? Despite being a highly successful president, Biden has a 37% approval rating, and the great economy hasn’t prevented him from falling behind a twice-impeached criminal! The sooner Biden passes the torch, the sooner Democrats can shift the public conversation!” When will this back-and-forth debate resolve? Your guess is as good as mine."
Biden's terrible polls are only strengthening his critics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-2024-polls-drop-out-rcna161348,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 3:00 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. Things are looking grim for Joe Biden. The president has been trailing former President Donald Trump in the polls since last year, but he’s experiencing what appears to be a daunting new deficit after his atrocious performance at the first presidential debate. The outlook is so rough that some Democrats are openly warning that Biden’s unpopularity could even affect down-ballot races for Democrats, dampening their ability to either win the House or hold on to the Senate. The threat of such catastrophic results in November will likely increase pressure from within the party for Biden to step aside for another Democrat. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Tuesday he believed Trump was on track “to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.” Bennet’s willingness to make such a statement is bad news for Biden’s efforts to mollify the increasing number of dissenting Democratic lawmakers who are expressing concern about or outright objecting to his candidacy. He had chosen to debate Trump months earlier than such debates are normally held to catch up to Trump in the polls. That plan backfired spectacularly. Biden is now worse off than before the debate, and he faces a growing mutiny from lawmakers who fear not just his loss but also their own. Polling averages aggregated by FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics show Trump surged and Biden dipped significantly in national polls after the June 27 debate. The averages put Biden a few points behind Trump, which is not by any means insurmountable. But Biden should be trouncing Trump, a corrupt aspiring autocrat, one of the most unpopular people to ever run for presidential office and a man recently convicted of 34 felony counts and found liable for sexual abuse. Around this time in their 2020 match-up, Biden was beating Trump by almost 10 points. It’s also important to remember that in 2016 and 2020 Trump outperformed the polls. That he’s consistently leading Biden this election cycle is alarming. Pollsters at the Cook Political report changed the status of three battleground states from toss-ups to “lean Republican” after the debate. And according to the combined data of the New York Times/Sienna College polls, Biden is seeing an extraordinary dip — Trump now has not just his biggest lead over Biden in this election cycle, but his largest lead over a Democrat since his 2016 White House bid. New York Times chief political correspondent and poll guru Nate Cohn told The New Yorker in a recent interview, “There are no precedents in recent memory for Presidents to have approval ratings like Biden’s who then go on to win re-election.”  Bennett isn’t the only Democratic lawmaker to suggest that Biden’s popularity could drag down senators and representatives in their races, especially in purple states. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who’s running for the Senate, expressed confidence Sunday in Democratic House and Senate candidates for now, noting that “they are running well ahead of the president,” but he expressed a note of caution that “you can only run so far ahead of the president.” Schiff also said the race between Biden and Trump “should not be even close, and the reason it is close is the president’s age.” University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said that in the battleground state of Georgia, Biden’s unpopularity “could be a problem” for Democratic challengers looking to flip districts. Biden is in a bind because there’s little he can do to turn the narrative around. Pollsters continue to find that his key vulnerability is the long-held perception that he’s too old for the job — and some surveys even find that voters find it more concerning than Trump’s criminal charges. Biden can do a lot to try to connect more with voters, but he can’t become younger, and, thus, he can’t do anything about his most glaring vulnerability. Democrats are correct to worry that Biden’s weak standing in polls bodes poorly for not only his re-election prospects, but also for their prospects in elections across his entire party. That could be what pushes some lawmakers who are on the fence about to press him to step aside."
The Republican Party platform has an audience of one,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republican-party-platform-trump-project-2025-rcna161259,"In a matter of days, former President Donald Trump’s anti-democracy agenda will most likely be met with thunderous applause as he officially accepts the Republican nomination for president at the party’s national convention.  The picture of a lawless America mired in poverty and perversion that Trump will paint isn’t backed up by reality, but it is set to be backed up by the official Republican Party platform. On Monday, the Republican platform committee advanced a draft of the so-called principles that will guide the Republican Party for the next four years. But this platform isn’t a road map to prosperity for the American people. It doesn’t offer a framework for unity in a fractured country. Instead, it is a manifesto for one man: Trump. The 16-page document is written to appeal to his sensibilities — emotionally, rhetorically and even grammatically (the erratic capitalization reads like one of his unhinged social media rants). And because it’s tailor-made for the convicted figurehead of this once-great party, it’s riddled with lies and belligerence designed to divide us further. Some tenets reflect the heartlessness Trump has ushered in. For instance, the platform promises to “CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY” — a policy that Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts also backed in his recent interview with ""The Weekend"" about Project 2025. Let’s put the logistics of deporting millions of people — many of whom have built lives and started families in this country — and kneecapping the economy aside for a moment. Let’s focus instead on the morality of breaking those families up, of devaluing human lives to the point of boasting about it. The position flies in the face of President Ronald Reagan’s more measured stance. After noting that “our strength comes from our own immigrant heritage and our capacity to welcome those from other lands,” Reagan said: Reagan later signed substantial immigration reform into law with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That bill banned the hiring of undocumented immigrants while still ensuring a pathway to lawful permanent residence and eventual citizenship for some 2.7 million undocumented immigrants who entered the country before 1982. That’s a far cry from today’s Republican Party, which paints an apocalyptic picture of a so-called invasion at the southern border while tanking solutions to the issue at Trump’s direction. The platform is also riddled with these kinds of contradictions.  The document highlights the importance of free speech multiple times throughout its pages, pledging to “ban the Federal Government from colluding with anyone to censor Lawful Speech.” In the same document, it vows “to keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America.”  Exactly how do you do that? I fervently disagree with communism, Marxism and socialism, but like the views that animate this MAGA platform, they aren't unlawful, and, as long as their expression doesn’t put people in physical danger, I believe that even views I disagree with shouldn’t be regulated by the government.  If the government can begin sanctioning everyday people for their political views alone, it sets a dangerous precedent. The platform acknowledges this with the pledge to “hold accountable those who have misused the power of Government to unjustly prosecute their Political Opponents.” Then, there’s a tapestry of issues that the Republican Party under Trump has proven ineffective at addressing. “Republicans will reassert greater Federal Control over Washington, DC to restore Law and Order in our Capital City, and ensure Federal Buildings and Monuments are well-maintained.” The irony is palpable. On Jan. 6, 2021, a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the U.S. Capitol, where they shattered windows, ransacked offices and trashed the emblem of American democracy. Federal authorities estimate that Trump’s foot soldiers wreaked $2.73 million in damage. Now, Republicans claiming to support law and order have largely backed Trump’s promise to pardon the rioters who desecrated a building paid for by U.S. taxpayers while also threatening to undermine the self-governance of our capital city.  Then there's the platform's vow to “END INFLATION,"" a problem already under control. Just this Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that year-over-year inflation rose only 3% last month — a sharper decrease than expected, continuing a steady reduction from a peak of 9% two years prior. Or maybe Trump means the inflation that he will kick off with his other campaign pledges, as economists have warned that the drastic increases in tariffs he has endorsed would decimate that progress and worsen inflation. The current Republican platform is incoherent, hate-filled and ham-fisted, but that should come as no surprise. It was made in the image of the man who will accept the party’s nomination in just a few days. A famous speech in ""Macbeth"" compares life to “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing,” as the Scottish king’s empire implodes. The platform of this once-great party has “sound and fury” in spades and is being told by no shortage of idiots, but unfortunately, it doesn’t signify “nothing.” It signifies what will guide the MAGA party if it is given the chance to write laws that govern your life. Vote accordingly. For more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC."
‘Unfit to lead’: New York Times’ editorial board urges voters not to vote for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:49 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/new-york-times-trump-editorial-board-unfit-to-lead-rcna161408,"On the cusp of Donald Trump’s official nomination for president next week, The New York Times’ editorial board delivered an excoriating rebuke of the presumptive GOP nominee, saying he is unfit to serve a second term as president. “Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution, the rule of law and the American people,” wrote the Times’ editorial board, which is separate from its newsroom. “Instead of a cogent vision for the country’s future, Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests, satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him. “He is, quite simply, unfit to lead.” Published Thursday morning, four days before the start of the Republican National Convention, the opinion piece also criticizes the GOP and its endorsement of Trump: The board pointed to the extraordinary fracturing within the Democratic Party right now over President Joe Biden’s re-election bid and lamented Republicans’ failure to have such a debate among their ranks “about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer.” The editorial also called on voters to “pay attention to what he did as president and allow yourself to truly inhabit what he has promised to do if returned to office.” The screed against Trump isn’t likely to sway any of his hard-core fans, but it might carry weight in what is shaping up to be a close, high-stakes election. The Times is often accused by the right and the left of being biased against their side, but it’s generally seen as a liberal-leaning newspaper, whether that’s true or not. And the paper can influence the public conversation, as evidenced by the assumed impact of its near-obsessive coverage of Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016."
Meet the MAGA influencer turned Project 2025 adviser who could staff the White House,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-henchman-project2025-rcna161428,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 10 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Donald Trump really wants you to believe he has nothing to do with Project 2025, the 900-page wish list of far-right proposals ready to go should he win the presidency in November. He even went so far as to claim, “I have no idea who is behind it.” Well, someone who is behind Project 2025 is John McEntee. He was frequently seen in photos with Trump holding the former president's bag. McEntee used to be Trump's bodyman — basically a personal assistant — during the early years of his administration ... and it didn’t end well. In 2018, McEntee was abruptly forced out of his post and escorted off the White House grounds amid an investigation by the Secret Service for serious financial crimes. According to The Wall Street Journal, McEntee was a habitual gambler, betting tens of thousands of dollars at a time, and was deemed a security risk as a result. The chief of staff at the time, John Kelly, effectively had him tossed off the White House premises. We should note, McEntee was never charged with a crime. Despite it all, McEntee remained loyal to Trump. The former college football player and Fox News production assistant was such a strong believer in Trump’s message that, back in 2015, he repeatedly cold-emailed the Trump campaign, begging for a job. The campaign eventually brought him on as a volunteer and then as a paid staffer. McEntee was so committed to the cause he worked out of a space in Trump Tower with just three walls and an unfinished floor. His loyalty to the boss paid off. After Trump fired Kelly he brought McEntee back, this time as the director of the Presidential Personnel Office — the guy who decided who got to work for the president. In that role, McEntee worked to purge staffers deemed insufficiently loyal, all while ensuring only the most rabid Trump toadies got jobs in the White House. He was also deeply involved in Trump’s attempted coup, including efforts to pressure Mike Pence to reject the results of the 2020 election. Journalist Jon Karl called him “The Man Who Made Jan. 6th Possible."" After the coup failed, McEntee spun his notoriety into a career as something of a conservative influencer: selling a MAGA dating app and posting deranged videos on social media. Including one in which he bragged about giving homeless people fake money. McEntee later claimed the video was a joke. That sounds like a pretty gross and weird joke to me. So why are we talking about John McEntee? Well, he's now a senior adviser to Project 2025, specifically, its “Presidential Personnel Database."" It's Project 2025's plan to staff the White House if Trump wins in November. That means the grifting, gambling Jan. 6 henchman — who was too much of a security issue for the Trump administration — is going to be the guy vetting resumes the second time around. Is that someone you want in charge of the most important personnel office in the country?      "
"Trump set for another playdate with Hungary's authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-viktor-orban-hungary-russia-rcna161443,"Donald Trump on Thursday is scheduled to have another authoritarian playdate with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The meeting, juxtaposed to the NATO summit President Joe Biden has been hosting this week, highlights the stark contrast between a campaign that’s chosen to align itself with dictatorial foreign leaders and an administration that’s aligned with democratic ones. By the week’s end, Biden will have delivered a forceful speech and held various meetings in support of maintaining America’s alliances and the democratic values they uphold. Trump, on the other hand, will have admitted he barely knew what NATO was before he became president and will have met with one of the group’s most unreliable members in Orban.  Trump and his followers have openly celebrated Orban’s illiberal ways over the last few years, with right-wing activists going so far as to host a Conservative Political Action Conference event in Hungary in 2022. In March of this year, Trump claimed “there’s nobody that’s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orban,” going on to call him “fantastic” and boasting about his authoritarian style. “He’s a noncontroversial figure because he says, ‘This is the way it’s going to be,’ and that’s the end of it. Right?” Trump gushed. “He’s the boss.” Orban, for the record, has condemned “mixed race” nations, has cracked down on press freedoms, has said his vision for Hungary is “illiberal democracy,” and has overseen the rigging of Hungary’s political system to favor his political party over others. In many ways, he has done to his country what Trump and his allies aspire to accomplish in the United States. Which apparently includes turning Hungary into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proxy. Orban has turned Hungary into a dubious — if not deliberately destructive — NATO partner through his efforts to distance his country from the group and his coziness with Putin. Just last week, Orban met with Putin privately to discuss Ukraine and emerged from the meeting parroting Putin’s talking points.  Trump, of course, said in February that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that don’t pay into the group what he thinks they should — a theme he has returned to repeatedly (as my colleague Steve Benen wrote in 2020, Trump “still doesn’t fully understand the basics of the alliance’s finances”). And after their meeting earlier this year, Orban said that Trump told him that if he’s elected president, he won’t give “a penny” to Ukraine, essentially allowing Russia to continue its deadly power grab. Thursday’s meeting between the two men is likely to touch on Orban's unilateral machinations to engineer a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine. But the meeting itself is a revealing signal of how a Trump administration is likely to alienate America’s allies, with potentially disastrous results — in contrast to a Biden administration that would continue to maintain those bonds."

‘It was torture’: Texas mom recounts being denied abortion for doomed pregnancy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/health-mindset/-was-torture-texas-mom-recounts-denied-abortion-doomed-pregnancy-rcna161450,"When Samantha Casiano of East Texas found out she was pregnant with her fifth child, she was ecstatic. But at a 20-week ultrasound, she received shocking news. Her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a rare and fatal condition that prevents the skull and brain from fully forming. This was in December 2022, after the Texas Heartbeat Act, or Senate Bill 8, was enacted. The law bans abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which usually occurs after about six weeks of pregnancy. It was passed nearly nine months before the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion. “I was told that it meant that my daughter was incompatible with life. And I wouldn’t be adding another little human to our family. It was really hard to hear that. It felt like it was a dream -- a really, really bad dream, Casiano, 30, recounted. Casiano said she was told by her doctor that the baby “would die, either before I give birth, or as soon as I do give birth.” Because of Texas’ strict abortion laws, Casiano had few options. The state bans abortions in almost all cases, with the exceptions of “life threatening” conditions to the mother. Casiano said she was unable to travel outside of the state for an abortion due to financial and logistical constraints. So, she was forced to go to term with her baby. “Just imagine yourself waking up every morning, knowing that your daughter was going to die. You can feel her kick and move, but she’s going to die. So you have to plan her funeral while she’s inside of you,” said Casiano. “And that’s probably the hardest thing any mother has to go through…It was traumatizing and hard.. Just thinking about it now is just me makes my stomach hurt. And I was forced to go through it. It was torture.”  Four hours after giving birth, Casiano’s daughter, Halo Hope, passed away. “She gasped for air for four hours … She changed colors right in front of me.” Casiano recalled. “And at a certain point, I couldn’t mentally and emotionally [cope]. I feel like mentally I had to close off in order to keep sane.” Casiano wants the world to hear her story, especially as a new study is shedding light on the effects abortion bans have had on infant mortality.  According to a report published in JAMA Pediatrics, infant mortality increased 12.9 percent from 2021 to 2022 in Texas after the state enacted a near-total abortion ban. A total of 2,240 infants in Texas died in 2022, compared to 1,985 the year prior.  Of those deaths, a disproportionate amount involved congenital abnormalities. Dr. Alison Gemmill, a lead author on the report, said the findings suggest that infant deaths due to congenital abnormalities in Texas were a direct effect of the ban during the 2021-2022 time period. “We saw a 23 percent increase in those deaths in Texas, but a 3 percent decrease in the rest of the U.S.” Fatal fetal abnormalities can be detected through a fetal anatomy scan, like in Casiano’s case, but are usually not detected until about 20 weeks into the pregnancy — well after Texas’ six week abortion ban limit.  Casiano was one of the 20 pregnant women denied abortions in Texas, along with two obstetrician-gynecologists who sued the state of Texas. Represented by the Center of Reproductive Rights, they argued the state’s medical exceptions to its abortion ban were not clear enough for doctors to interpret. The case, which asked for more clear medical guidelines to its states abortion ban, was ultimately rejected by the Texas Supreme Court in May.    Becky Uranga, an OB-GYN in Idaho, said abortion healthcare is a critical part of working with mothers who are carrying babies with congenital abnormalities. “We want to make sure we identify those [abnormalities] early — talk about options and choices and make sure we have the appropriate care (specific pediatric specialists) available. These pregnancies are often at much higher risk for preterm rupture of membranes, bleeding issues or preterm deliveries.”  In Idaho, where Uranga practices, there is a near-total ban on abortion. Just last month, The Supreme Court last ruled an exception exists when the life of the mother is at risk.   Casiano said one of the biggest heartaches of her experience was knowing her daughter had to suffer through her last breaths. Grieving her death, she shared, started the day Halo was diagnosed with the fatal condition, “I should have been able to release my daughter that day. I just wasn’t able to. I was restricted from doing that,” she said.  Now Casiano visits Halo’s grave every year on her baby’s birthday, which she has mixed emotions about. “When I buried her, it was a bittersweet moment…releasing her into heaven. But I’m mad that it took this long to get there. She shouldn’t have had to wait that long.”  Daniela Pierre-Bravo is a journalist, author, and founder of Acceso Community — a mentorship program for professional women.

The Supreme Court has pulled off a judicial coup. Here’s how to fight back.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cori-bush-reform-supreme-court-watch-democracy-die-rcna161409,"Last week, the Supreme Court’s far-right majority went home for the summer, but only after a stark reminder that they do not serve the people of this country — they serve Donald Trump and MAGA extremism. They serve wealthy corporations exploiting our communities. They serve whichever right-wing billionaire gives them the most gifts. This term, the same extremist justices who overturned the constitutional right to abortion and ended affirmative action doubled down on the court’s legacy of protecting the interests of wealth and white supremacy. These unelected justices have pulled off a judicial coup on behalf of fascists and billionaires. They have enabled Trump to evade accountability. They have opened the door for the MAGA cult to destroy our rights through Project 2025. They have greenlit the criminalization of homelessness. They have left millions of people in states like Missouri vulnerable to bans on emergency abortions and other attacks on reproductive rights. And they have provided a road map for wealthy corporations to harm our planet and our communities by handcuffing the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and countless other agencies from regulating them. The Republican-appointed justices are fighting a war on behalf of far-right extremists against the people of this country, and they are just getting started. Congress has a choice to make: reform the court or bear witness to the death of democracy and the destruction of the communities it should protect. Court reform is often discussed in abstract terms, but the reality is that for communities like St. Louis, it is a matter of life or death. This court has determined that my constituents cannot access abortion care. That they deserve weaker labor protections. That it’s fine if they drink polluted water and breathe polluted air, are subject to voter suppression, are more likely to be unhoused, and are subject to the whims of fascist presidents who seek immunity and absolute impunity. Court reform is personal for me — not just as a member of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, but as a survivor of gun violence, as someone who has had an abortion, as the daughter of a former union meat cutter, and as a congresswoman representing a community that has been systematically denied the right to vote. And it should be personal to everyone who cares about our democracy and our freedoms. The gavel’s fall should signify justice served, not lives destroyed. Our lives and our communities are worse off because of this unchecked, extremist Supreme Court. The time for reform is now. Congress must remove lawless justices through impeachment — that’s why this week my colleagues and I introduced articles of impeachment against Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito over their multiple ethical conflicts and failures to disclose. Congress must also pass legislation that imposes a binding code of ethics for every justice. We must expand the Court to 13 seats by passing the Judiciary Act, which I proudly co-lead. Congress must enact term limits for the justices. Finally, we must strip the Supreme Court of its power to invalidate federal laws that protect our fundamental rights. We cannot let the Supreme Court continue to sign death warrants for our communities. The longer we wait, the more vulnerable to fascism we become. I ask my colleagues in Congress: In this perilous moment, will we reform the court or will we watch democracy die?"
Biden and his allies need to make a decision — fast.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-divided-biden-trump-democracy-rcna161343,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 11 episode of ""Morning Joe."" In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus issued a condemnation of judgmental religious leaders: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."" In 1858, with the specter of a civil war rising in the United States over the issue of slavery, Abraham Lincoln accepted the Illinois Republican nomination for Senate, quoting Jesus and remarking in a now well-known speech, “A house divided against itself cannot stand."" Lincoln told his fellow Republicans, ""I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."" He then encouraged his party to stand together as they had done in the past, ""Two years ago, the Republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external circumstance against us."" Lincoln’s words to Republicans in 1858 are all too relevant to Democrats today, as we approach a pivotal weekend for the future of our democracy. There's a rupture running deep throughout the Democratic Party: a split tearing at its very foundation. It's a divide that will only serve to elect a man who has repeatedly promised to be a dictator. President Joe Biden is on one side of this Democratic divide. In 2020, the president and his supporters saved American democracy by defeating Donald Trump, a malignant force promising to undermine the Constitution, make common cause with America’s enemies, and refuse to accept any democratic election result that declared him defeated. Against the grim backdrop of his predecessor, Biden passed more bipartisan legislation and created more jobs than any president this generation. He also led America out of Covid more successfully than any other country on the planet, and has overseen the strongest dollar in a half-century. America’s economy is now the envy of the world. Period. Under Biden, our military and alliances are stronger relative to the rest of the world than at any time since World War II. This is not a matter of debate, unless you get your news from hucksters on TikTok or a cable news channel allergic to the truth. Despite what Trumpists say, America is great, strong and respected across the world. Biden is showing as much by hosting a NATO summit this week — under his leadership, the alliance has become the strongest in the world’s history. On the other side of the divide, many of the most powerful Democratic politicians, thought leaders and donors say privately — and soon may say publicly — that Biden can't win in November. That's become an almost universal sentiment among dozens of Democrats over the last 36 hours. They say the polls are collapsing, fundraising is drying up and any chance of saving the Senate and House from Trump's rule is vanishing before their eyes. Those are the two sides to this Democratic divide both with compelling arguments. But the window for saving American democracy is closing. Biden is dug in: he has the votes and the delegates. In the president's eyes, it's his rightful nomination. Also dug in are those who revere Biden but cherish democracy even more, and for them this is a zero-sum game. That's why the handful of Democrats that Biden greatly respects — Nancy Pelosi, Ted Kauffman, Jim Clyburn, Chris Dodd, John Kerry, Ron Klain, and his family — Jill, Val and Hunter Biden — need to come together this weekend and talk about the consequences of this campaign and this candidacy on our country’s future. Democrats must come to a decision and unite against the immediate threat before America’s 240-year constitutional republic: Donald Trump. Lincoln finished that 1858 speech by telling his fellow party members that against the ""strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the battle through, under the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and pampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now? Now, when that same enemy is wavering, dissevered and belligerent? This result is not doubtful. We shall not fail if we stand firm. We shall not fail.” So said Lincoln then. So says a watchful and worried nation now."
Jim Jordan’s latest hearing was a frightening look at American authoritarianism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 1:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jim-jordan-weaponization-business-advertisers-rcna161425,"At a hearing Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan gave American businesses yet another preview of the authoritarian rule they can expect to run rampant if Donald Trump is elected president. Ever since Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives, the Ohio Republican has used his leadership position to press private businesses to bend to conservatives’ will. Under the guise of opposing government weaponization against conservatives, Jordan has weaponized his role as Judiciary chair to lean on social media companies to try to prevent them from stopping the spread of hate speech and disinformation online — efforts that Jordan and his allies revealingly paint as anti-Republican attacks. And as an extension of that crusade, they’ve targeted corporations that they dubiously claim have avoided advertising with conservatives. It’s all part of the conservative movement’s assault on free enterprise, which continued Wednesday when Jordan invited corporate advertisers to testify and then harangued them. In this clip, for example, Jordan suggests that the advertisers have nefariously avoided advertising on far-right commentator Ben Shapiro’s platform … as Shapiro sits right next to them. The executives, including Unilever USA President Herrish Patel and GroupM global CEO Christian Juhl, pushed back on Jordan’s claims and denied they make advertising decisions based on political views. But the real issue is that this hearing occurred at all. It had the feel of a kleptocracy — a government of people who use their powers to pry resources from citizens and hand those resources to well-connected elites. All this had me thinking about comments made by historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat on Wednesday’s episode of “The ReidOut.” Ben-Ghiat explained to Joy that authoritarian governments like the one Trump hopes to establish are known for their kleptocracy, which often takes the form of attacks on private businesses. You can watch the full segment here. It really puts Jordan’s authoritarian spectacle in context, and serves as a warning about the independence that Americans — and the businesses they run — stand to lose if Trump and his allies win in November."
Hackers join the fight to inform the public about Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 12:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/project-2025-hackers-heritage-foundation-rcna161400,"It looks like hacktivists have joined the fight to shine a light on Project 2025, the far-right blueprint for reshaping the government to achieve ultraconservative goals if Donald Trump is elected president in November.  Google searches for “Project 2025” have skyrocketed in recent weeks, likely due in part to celebrities, including Taraji P. Henson at the BET Awards last month, drawing attention to the extremist plan. A group of hackers has joined the effort to pull back the curtain on Project 2025. On Tuesday, the cybersecurity news outlet CyberScoop reported that a collective comprised of self-described “gay furry hackers"" that calls itself SiegedSec gained access to Heritage Foundation data. Specifically, the collective said it gained access to a website hosting content produced by members of the Heritage Foundation, the organization that assembled Project 2025 with the help of several members of Trump’s former administration.  Per CyberScoop: A SiegedSec spokesperson who goes by “vio” told CyberScoop that the data the group accessed includes “full names, email addresses, passwords, and usernames” of people associated with Heritage. But a Heritage spokesperson denied that the organization was “hacked,” telling CyberScoop that “an organized group stumbled upon a two-year-old archive of The Daily Signal website that was available on a public-facing website owned by a contractor.” Nonetheless, Heritage folks don’t sound happy about this data dump. The Daily Dot shared excerpts of angry text messages sent from Mike Howell — a former Trump administration official and the executive director of the Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project — to vio. Howell confirmed the authenticity of the texts to The Daily Dot via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. No one likes to be targeted by hackers — so Howell’s apparent discomfort with the situation is understandable. But it's unsurprising that openly promoting an authoritarian agenda could draw the ire of many people, including so-called ""gay furry hackers."""
"The GOP's latest anti-Garland gambit fails, despite Trump’s push",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 11:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-latest-anti-garland-gambit-fails-trumps-push-rcna161421,"Congressional Republicans haven’t given up on their crusade against Attorney General Merrick Garland, but as NBC News reported Thursday afternoon, their efforts aren’t going especially well. The final tally was 210-204. The measure would’ve passed, but four House Republicans — Reps. David Joyce of Ohio, Mike Turner of Ohio, Tom McClintock of California, and John Duarte of California — balked and voted with the Democratic minority. For those who might benefit from a refresher, let’s recap how we arrived at this point. Several months ago, former special counsel Robert Hur wrapped up his investigation into President Joe Biden inadvertently taking some classified documents after his vice presidential tenure ended. Not surprisingly, the prosecutor decided not to indict the incumbent president. Soon after, Hur released a report, which included a transcript of an interview that Biden volunteered to participate in. (Donald Trump, in contrast, refused to be interviewed by either special counsel Robert Mueller or special counsel Jack Smith.) In theory, that ended the story. In practice, however, there was one additional element that Republicans decided to pursue: the audio recording of the incumbent president’s Q&A with investigators. Republicans admitted that they were just looking for a campaign cudgel, but that didn't deter the effort. When the White House asserted executive privilege, and the Justice Department told Congress it wouldn’t get the recording, House GOP members voted to hold Garland in contempt. And then things got a little weird. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida recently announced a plan to go after the attorney general with an “inherent contempt” measure that would, for all intents and purposes, empower the House’s sergeant-at-arms to arrest Garland. When that failed to gain traction, Luna turned to Plan B — a second “inherent contempt” measure that would subject the A.G. to $10,000-a-day fines until the Justice Department provided lawmakers with the interview tapes. On Wednesday, this effort received a hearty endorsement from Trump. Roughly 24 hours later, the measure fell short in the House anyway. What’s next? One can only guess, though it seems inevitable that the GOP majority will continue to explore new ways to go after the attorney general. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The SAVE Act saves nobody — but would make it harder to vote,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 11:07 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-republicans-save-act-mike-johnson-trump-rcna160741,"The House passed a bill Wednesday that Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., claims will counter a major scourge that threatens the sanctity of federal elections. Republicans argue that the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act — which passed 221-198 — is necessary to defend against noncitizens voting in the fall, potentially swinging the results of federal elections. In reality, the SAVE Act is a solution to an all-but-nonexistent problem, but if enacted would make it harder for American citizens to exercise their right to vote. As with much of the House Republican agenda, this bill owes its existence Donald Trump. Johnson joined the former president at Mar-a-Lago in April to talk about “election integrity,” the sanitized term that the GOP has adopted to launder Trump’s 2020 election conspiracy theories. Since that day, the speaker has made the subtext of the bill’s intentions into text, falsely claiming on X that Democrats oppose the resulting bill because “they want illegals to vote in our elections.” Unsurprisingly, this is false. Republicans will point to a few cities like New York and Washington that allow noncitizens to vote. But that permission only applies to legal residents participating in local elections, not state or federal contests. Given how rare it is that noncitizens even attempt to register to vote, let alone manage to cast a ballot, the bill is an Anti-Tiger Rock at best, falsely taking credit for solving a problem that doesn’t actually exist. And like most snake oil, it’s much more likely that this bill will leave the patient sicker than if this supposed palliative had never been offered. In practice, the SAVE Act, drafted by archconservative Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, overhauls the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. That act mandates that states allow residents to register to vote when applying for a driver’s license or other official ID card. In states like New York, that requires applicants to affirm that they’re a U.S. citizen as part of the process, signing an affidavit that makes clear that lying on the form is a crime. Under the SAVE Act, those states would now be forced to require applicants to provide documentary proof that they are a citizen, including a passport or birth certificate, at the time they fill out the form. This requirement would add a hurdle that many Americans born in the continental U.S. would not be able to easily clear. A survey that the Brennan Center for Justice and other democracy groups conducted last year found that “more than 9 percent of American citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, don’t have proof of citizenship readily available. … And at least 3.8 million don’t have these documents at all, often because they were lost, destroyed, or stolen.” Imagine that you’ve moved across state lines and need to register to vote in your new district. The odds that you may wait to change your registration — or never change it at all — would likely increase as more burdens are placed on the process, much as forcing people who qualify for federal aid to jump through hoops prevents them from accessing it. And forget about celebrities like Taylor Swift driving nearly as many people to register online at Vote.org if new registrants have to find and upload their documents as part of the process. Furthermore, the bill’s language is as dangerously imprecise in some areas as it is draconian in others. There is nothing that makes clear whether a state would have to accept documents from someone whose name has legally changed due to marriage or gender transition. Voters would likewise be allowed to register only if they provide a birth certificate issued by “a state, unit of local government, or a Tribal government.” That requirement could be waived with a naturalization certificate, say, but would have to be paired with a “valid government-issued photo identification card issued by a Federal, State or Tribal government.” As Del. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan, D-Northern Marianas Islands, pointed out in the floor debate, the bill’s language manages to completely ignore the territories, disenfranchising his constituents even further. Tellingly, the rhetoric from Republicans as the bill was being debated on the House floor on Wednesday mostly focused on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. A common refrain throughout the day was that the SAVE Act is necessary because of the number of immigrants who have entered the country since Biden took office. The Washington Post’s Philip Bump rightly referred to this bill as the legislative version of the Great Replacement Theory, which claims that Democrats are trying to drown out white voters with an influx of migrants who will vote illegally. The good news is that this bill will not pass the Senate this term, let alone avoid a presidential veto. But five swing district Democrats crossed party lines to give it their approval, showing their concern that the GOP’s rhetoric might hit home with their voters. Moreover, given the threat of a full GOP takeover of Congress next year, we could see the return of the SAVE Act. If so, it would not be as a cheap stunt to raise the specter of an immigrant takeover, but as a newly printed law on the books, one that would further chip away at access to Americans’ most fundamental rights."
"Shelley Duvall, who starred in ‘The Shining,’ dies at 75",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 8:53 AM PDT / Updated July 11, 2024, 9:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/shelley-duvall-dead-the-shining-rcna161372,"Shelley Duvall, an award-winning actress who most famously starred in Stanley Kubrick's horror classic ""The Shining,"" has died, her partner Dan Gilroy said. She was 75. ""She’s gone after much suffering, which I guess is a good thing,"" Gilroy told NBC News, adding: ""I can’t tell you how much I miss her."" Duvall had been in hospice care for the last few months while dealing with complications from diabetes, he said. She died in her sleep early Thursday at their home in Blanco, Texas, he said. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news of Duvall's death. Known for her distinctive doe-eyed mannerisms and the unconventional characters she chose to portray, Duvall has said that she never set out to be an actor. She attributed her film career to director Robert Altman, who cast her in her first role in his dark comedy, ""Brewster McCloud,"" in 1970. She went on to act in several other Altman films, including the Western ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" and ""Nashville,"" a musical comedy. She had several prominent leading roles in the 1980s, starring as Olive Oyl in the live-action ""Popeye"" movie opposite Robin Williams and in ""The Shining"" with co-star Jack Nicholson. Her role in ""The Shining"" was widely praised, although she later recounted how difficult it was to work under Kubrick's demanding process. Duvall won a Cannes best actress award in 1977 for her role in ""3 Women,"" a psychological horror film directed by Altman. In 2012, Duvall retreated from Hollywood for a break that would last 20 years. She was interviewed on an episode of ""Dr. Phil"" in 2016, appearing disheveled as she talked about her struggle with mental illness. The show was widely criticized at the time and accused of exploiting Duvall's struggle for viewers' entertainment. In a New York Times profile of the actress earlier this year, Gilroy said the ""Dr. Phil"" interview ""did nothing"" for Duvall. “It just put her on the map as an oddity,” he said. Duvall returned to acting with the 2023 indie horror film ""The Forest Hills."" It would also be her last movie."
Why it matters that a Nevada county refused to certify primary results,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 9:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/matters-nevada-county-refused-certify-primary-results-rcna161392,"Around this time two years ago, New Mexico held largely unremarkable primary elections, which went smoothly — for the most part. When it came time to certify the results of the primaries, Republican election officials in Otero County balked. They weren’t aware of any problems with the vote tallies or the local election equipment, but local GOP commissioners refused to certify the results anyway because of their conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated feelings about the voting process. Fortunately for everyone involved, it didn’t take too long to resolve the matter. New Mexico’s secretary of state, Democrat Maggie Toulouse Oliver, went to the state Supreme Court, asking the justices to order Otero County commissioners to certify the results. The justices agreed and directed local officials to do their job. This was not, however, an all’s-well-that-ends-well story. On the contrary, it raised uncomfortable questions about other Republican election officials elsewhere doing the same thing in the future. An Associated Press report described the mess in New Mexico as “a preview of the kind of chaos election experts fear is coming.” The article quoted Jennifer Morrell, a former election official in Colorado and Utah who now advises federal, state and local officials, saying, “We are in scary territory. If this can happen here, where next? It’s like a cancer, a virus. It’s metastasizing and growing.” That quote came to mind two years later reading this NBC News report out of Nevada. For those unfamiliar with Washoe County, this is Nevada’s second most populous county. It’s also considered a competitive area in one of the nation’s most closely watched swing states. What happens next isn’t altogether clear, but Nevada’s secretary of state and attorney general — both of whom are Democrats — said last night that local commissioners have failed to uphold state election laws. Just as we saw in New Mexico two years ago, USA Today reported that they’re reportedly preparing to ask the Nevada Supreme Court to require that officials in Washoe County meet their legal obligations. Chances are, this will work out, but an Associated Press report added, “The rejection of the recounts and questions over how to handle it raised concerns about what could happen in November if a local commission refused to certify the presidential election results.” Watch this space."
Arkansas group vows to fight ‘ridiculous’ rejection of abortion rights ballot initiative,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 9:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arkansas-abortion-rights-ballot-initiative-reject-rcna161330,"Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston on Wednesday rejected an effort to put an abortion rights amendment proposal on the November ballot, citing incomplete paperwork. Thurston, a Republican, told the group that collected signatures for the petition that it did not submit statements that showed it informed paid canvassers about the rules for gathering signatures and that it did not identify those paid canvassers by name. The group, Arkansans for Limited Government, announced on Friday that it had collected more than 101,000 signatures from registered voters to put the proposal on the ballot. The amendment to the state constitution would protect abortion access up to 18 weeks after fertilization and would extend that protection in cases of rape, incest and instances of a fatal fetal anomaly. But Thurston told the group that because of those paperwork omissions, some of the signatures submitted are ineligible, leaving the petition 3,322 signatures short of the required 90,704. Arkansans for Limited Government assailed the secretary of state in a statement late Wednesday. The group said it had worked with his office “during every step of the process” to make sure its organizers were adhering to the rules: “Asserting now that we didn’t provide required documentation regarding paid canvassers is absurd and demonstrably, undeniably incorrect,” the group said. Republican lawmakers in Arkansas cheered the secretary’s rejection of the proposal. In a post on X, Gov. Sarah Sanders mocked abortion rights advocates, writing, “Today the far left pro-abortion crowd in Arkansas showed they are both immoral and incompetent.” Securing abortion rights in the state constitution through a ballot measure has been a winning approach in Michigan, California and Ohio. Voters in several other states are also poised to vote on an amendment proposal in November. But replicating that success in Arkansas — a deep-red state with a near-total abortion ban, where zero abortions were reportedly performed last year — would be an uphill climb. Arkansans for Limited Government said it will keep pushing for the proposal. “We will fight this ridiculous disqualification attempt with everything we have,” the group said. “We will not back down.”"
Intellectual humility leads us to Kamala Harris as the least risky bet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 9:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-president-biden-2024-rcna161098,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 3:00 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. Questions about whether President Joe Biden could drop his candidacy for the White House have inspired a kind of fantasy football mindset among political junkies. Hop online or tune in to any water cooler conversation among Democrats who think Biden should step aside and you’ll hear people excitedly catalogue their favorite potential replacement tickets, listing the strengths and statistics behind the governors, senators, former first lady or Hollywood star who they believe should be drafted to lead Team Blue to victory.  These debates are fun, but they are indeed fantasies. People who think they know exactly how a candidate who holds statewide, local or no office would fare in a general election are dreaming. American presidential races are political contests unlike any other. Politicians can look good on paper in a specific milieu, but it’s impossible to predict how they will register with the general electorate. Or how they’ll endure oppo research and vicious negative messaging unlike anything they’ve faced before in their lives, backed by the best-financed agents of reactionary power in the world.  The Democratic Party is at a juncture where every possible path is extremely risky. The moment demands humility and agnosticism; the goal is not to identify an obvious winner, which is impossible, but to manage risk. If Biden steps aside, Vice President Kamala Harris is most likely the least risky option. The argument that Harris is less risky might strike some as counterintuitive. Her vice presidency has been marked by strikingly low favorability ratings. Biden assigned her a politically sensitive policy portfolio that led her to, for example, take positions on immigration that brought her under fire from both the left and the right. And reports indicating that Harris felt frustrated and sidelined by Biden’s team mar the narrative of a natural passing of the torch. But taking a cautious position on what we can know suggests Harris has fewer unknown variables in her potential candidacy. She has been in the national limelight for years and thus has extremely wide name recognition, far superior to commonly floated alternatives. She has endured MAGA attacks for years and can clearly handle the pressure. While a presidential bid would most likely inspire new right-wing efforts to find skeletons in her closet, odds are that most of what could’ve been used against her would’ve been used in 2020 to torpedo the Biden-Harris ticket. Harris is also unequivocally qualified for the position with her background as an attorney general, senator and, of course, vice president. And at about 20 years younger than both Biden and Trump, she would instantly be able to shed Biden’s greatest political liability and shift the energy of the party. The strongest counter to Harris is tied to her consistent unfavorability during Biden’s tenure. But that argument doesn’t take you particularly far when polling indicates that the most commonly floated names to replace Biden, such as Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, do not perform more strongly than Harris in head-to-head matchups with Trump. Is it possible that over time these candidates would ultimately outperform these polls, once they were better known? Yes. But it’s also possible that they would do worse the more voters came to know them. Remember how countless pundits, reporters and Republicans thought Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would be a formidable Trump slayer, only for him to become a national laughingstock, mocked for his awkwardness and apparent attempts to enhance his height? Any gut instincts about the nebulous and hyper-subjective X factor of so-called electability are mere guesses.  What we do know is Harris is far more battle-tested than any alternative. We also know that Harris would be the strongest candidate to quell objections among Democrats that they’ve been disenfranchised. If Biden stepped aside and proposed an open convention, then party insiders would select the nomination for a party that’s used to the direct democratic input of the primary system. That selection process could be divisive. And it could mean that on Election Day a lot of Democrats could end up asked to vote for a politician they’ve never heard of and never would’ve cast ballots for. By contrast, Harris’ vice presidency confers a unique kind of legitimacy compared to any other candidate. Millions elected her in 2020 as Biden’s designated successor, and she was also backed by most Democratic primary voters this year (even if the primaries were mostly a formality). And she would be carrying out exactly what vice presidents are most important for — stepping up to serve as president if the president is unable to serve. Last, one factor that’s almost certain is that the historic nature of a Harris candidacy would be likely to motivate women, Black voters and Black women in particular — indispensable constituencies for the Democrats — at exceptional levels. Former President Barack Obama drove record turnout among Black voters, and it seems likely that Harris could also tap into the special kind of energy that accompanies excitement for symbolic victories for marginalized communities. Most of the other names floated for president these days could not. National polls for the Democrats are dire these days, and I have no confidence that Biden, Harris or any of the most commonly named alternatives can pull off a win against Trump. But in a high-risk situation, it is prudent is to minimize unknown variables to reduce the likelihood of worst-case outcomes. Harris, a competent and qualified candidate who could claim democratic legitimacy and rejuvenate the party, offers us just that.   "
