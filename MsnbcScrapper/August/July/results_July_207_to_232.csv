This is exactly what Trump feared,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-drops-out-trump-joe-scarborough-rcna162935,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC’s special coverage on July 21. Through the weekend, there were an awful lot of questions that were going back and forth from people in the president’s tightest circle, and one of the questions that kept being asked was whether Joe Biden was going to endorse Kamala Harris or not. And the question didn’t revolve around whether he wanted to or not, but whether people in her camp thought it would be better for her to fight for it, win it on her own, and not be seen as somebody who was tapped by President Biden and so, in her own way, have a fresh start going into the campaign. So when I heard that he did come out and endorse Kamala Harris, I think a lot of Democrats that were going back and forth this weekend on this issue felt an awful lot of relief, because Democrats obviously believe Biden did a great job — he has a great record, along with Kamala Harris. And as he said, it’s absolutely necessary for the Democratic Party, if they want to defeat Donald Trump, to unite as one. And so his statement seems to hit all the right notes and comes at a good time. There was a fear that this might drag on another week or two — and in that case, you would have massive Democratic defections every day. So the timing seems to be about as good as it could have been to end what has just been one of the craziest two or three weeks in American politics in quite some time. The morning after the debate, I got on and said that the president needed to ask whether he was capable of doing this and take a little bit of time to figure it out. I think he took a little more time than I was expecting. But after saying that, I heard from people that were extraordinarily close to him, people who work for him, actually calling me up and saying, “President Biden needs space. If Democrats and people in the media say the sort of things that you said today and he’s not given that space, he’s going to be far more likely to get into a corner and stay in the race.” So I think so much of what Biden’s inner circle did over the last couple of weeks was to provide him that space. And it’s what Nancy Pelosi was trying to do — it’s why you didn’t see massive defections of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 people a day, even though it was starting to get bad. I think the whole idea was give him the space to make this decision. He made the decision. And I will say, the most telling thing about how positive this may be for the Democratic Party is the Republican response. Earlier this morning, Newt Gingrich was was going on Twitter talking about how this is a violation of democracy, how it’s shocking and stunning that they’re delegitimizing the votes of 14.5 million Democrats. You also have House Speaker Mike Johnson going around saying that he’s going to do everything he can to try to nullify this, despite the fact Democrats haven’t even had their convention yet. So he’s standing on no ground at all. I’ve also had a good bit of reporting from deep inside the Trump camp that this is the one thing that Donald Trump feared. He has always considered himself to be the ultimate disrupter. And for the first time — not just in his political life, but the first time in his media life, in his professional life — the disruption is on the other side. People are not having to respond to the shocking turn of events from him for once. Trump and his campaign team are going to have to respond to this shocking turn of events — and they’re not happy about it at all. And I think that’s why you’re seeing a lot of Trump’s acolytes in politics and the media coming out and bitterly complaining about this."
"As Biden passes the torch, both parties ask, ‘What happens now?’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-passes-torch-both-parties-ask-happens-now-rcna162938,"In his first television interview after last month’s presidential debate, President Joe Biden told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, “If I stop now, I’d go down in history as a pretty successful president.” By any fair measure, the incumbent had a point. Biden has an impressive record of accomplishments, and when scholars ranked all American presidents earlier this year, Biden fared quite well — which was more than his immediate predecessor could say. But facing daunting odds and a party filled with members who’d lost confidence in his ability to win in the fall, the Democrat’s “if I stop now” comments suddenly have renewed relevance. As my MSNBC colleague Hayley Miller summarized: “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter to Americans. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” He soon after endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. The stunning and historic announcement left the nation with a rather obvious question: “What happens now?” Unfortunately for everyone involved in the process, there is no precedent for such circumstances. Election Day 2024 is just 15 weeks away; the Democratic National Convention is poised to kick off four weeks from tomorrow; and there is no existing road map for officials to follow. For Democrats, the list of questions is long, and the list of answers is not. How will the party choose a nominee? Biden has endorsed Harris, and that will carry significant weight. Similarly, a variety of prominent congressional Democrats have also thrown their support behind the vice president. But others in the party have balked at the idea of a “coronation,” and there’s been talk in recent weeks about a possible “mini-primary” system — what some have referred to as a “blitz” primary — and that conversation is likely to intensify in the coming hours and days. What’s to come of the virtual nominating process? Officials at the Democratic National Committee have said they intend to move forward with plans for a virtual process in early August, not to curtail the debate over Biden, but in order to address potential legal hurdles regarding the ballot in some key states. The president’s announcement will complicate those plans. The Democratic running mate? No matter who the nominee is, they will obviously need a running mate, and the vetting process should’ve started weeks, if not months, ago. That said, a Washington Post report noted overnight that major Democratic donors “are funding a preliminary vetting process for potential vice-presidential nominees,” adding: “In recent days, people involved in the effort have contacted the teams of top Democratic figures, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive effort. The donors are also interested in vetting North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.” What about the money Biden has raised? Election law experts can speak to this with more authority than I can, but a recent NBC News report, published before Biden’s announcement, said: “If President Joe Biden decides to step aside for the 2024 race, Vice President Kamala Harris would be in line to get first dibs on the tens of millions of dollars in his campaign war chest.” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said during a call three weeks ago that in the event of the president dropping out, Harris would then control most of the money in their campaign account. NBC News’ report added, “That appears to be correct, according to some campaign finance experts — but likely only if she then became the Democrats’ presidential nominee.” What about Republicans? It is not a secret that Donald Trump and his party saw Biden as a highly vulnerable, easy-to-defeat incumbent. In fact, The New York Times reported overnight that the former president’s senior team “would prefer that Mr. Biden remains in the race,” adding: “After the debate, the Trump team decided to hold back advertising that could further damage Mr. Biden.” Now that the incumbent president is ending his candidacy, GOP officials and their allies will have to overhaul pretty much everything — their strategy, their messaging, their expectations, their advertising, etc. — and will simultaneously be launching legal challenges in the hopes of making the Democrats’ process as messy and difficult as possible. As recently as Sunday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson explicitly endorsed those legal tactics. Buckle up."
Why Kamala Harris is a stronger candidate than you think,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 5, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-biden-trump-election-rcna160078,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 4:10 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. The first time Kamala Harris ran for president, the result could generously be described as mediocre. In a post-mortem for her 2020 presidential campaign, which ended before any votes had been cast, NBC News reported that her run “began with an explosion of enthusiasm but fizzled quickly.” Aside from a strong first debate performance — highlighted, ironically, by a clash with Joe Biden — Harris never broke out of the middle of the primary pack. Memories of that failed bid hover over Harris as Democrats consider the possibility that Biden will abandon his attempt at re-election, leaving her the logical nominee of their party. Is she a strong enough campaigner to win a general election? Could she unite the party and win over independent voters? Would she be able to overcome the inevitable torrent of racism and misogyny headed her way? Not long ago, many Democrats would have answered no to those questions. But this is, to put it mildly, a unique circumstance. In fact, this may be the perfect circumstance, if not the only one, for Harris to win a presidential election.  Let’s dispense with one question right away: If Biden does decide to step aside, Harris will be the party’s nominee. That’s due not to any ballot requirement (the party hasn’t yet named Biden as its nominee), but to political reality. Harris is the vice president and heir apparent. Skipping over her would be taken as an insult to Black women, one of the party’s most important constituencies. Because she and Biden share a campaign committee, she would have unfettered access to his campaign funds. Other potential candidates, including Govs. Gavin Newsom (California), Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan) and Josh Shapiro (Pennsylvania), are smart enough to know that an effort to elbow her out of the way would most likely fail and damage their future ambitions.  So why might Harris be a stronger candidate than people give her credit for? First, the fact that she ran and lost before tells us very little; plenty of politicians have run, lost and done better when they ran again. Biden himself ran two abysmal presidential campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, before his 2020 victory. George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon all became president after losing. Their successful races were as much about being in the right place at the right time as learning from their mistakes. The scenario in which Harris replaces Biden involves a brief and intense general election campaign of about three months — and that could work to her advantage. The truncated campaign would upend the prevailing theme of news coverage that emphasizes disillusionment and demobilization by presenting the election as a choice between two unpalatable alternatives. Encouraged by the tone of that coverage, many undecided voters have understood their choice as between a geezer or a lunatic convicted of a felony. Harris, on the other hand, is neither old (she’s 59) nor crazy. Republicans would attempt to portray her as a far-left radical, just as they do with every Democrat. But independent voters might reasonably conclude that she would neither nod off in critical meetings nor erect a sign outside the Oval Office reading “Bribes Accepted Here.” And if she lost the election, she wouldn’t try to overthrow the government. Harris might carry the baggage of things voters don’t like about the Biden administration, but some of his problems wouldn’t transfer to her. Just by being energetic, she would be a step up from Biden as a campaigner. Would the Muslim Americans livid at Biden for his embrace of the Israeli government feel equally angry at Harris and sit out the election? Perhaps, but they might well view her as an opportunity for a fresh start. The same could be true of the younger voters who have been lukewarm on the president. And though it’s true that she occasionally gets mired in banality, today that seems like the most trivial of problems. Her best moments, on the other hand, have come when she’s acting as the prosecutor she once was. And prosecuting the case against Donald Trump is the singular task of the Democratic nominee. Trump has never been popular; he lost the popular vote twice, produced two disastrous midterm elections for his party and is the only president in the history of polling to never crack 50% approval even for a day. Voters need to be constantly reminded of Trump’s misdeeds, and Harris is more capable of making that case than Biden is. She would also bring out the worst in Trump; we can all imagine the repulsive things he would say about her, which would thrill his hateful cultists but reinforce for the rest of the electorate why they don’t like him.  Furthermore, in the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, Harris has become the administration’s chief advocate on reproductive freedom, which is the single most important policy issue in this campaign and could be the key to a Democratic victory. She is far more passionate speaking about it than Biden, whose evident discomfort with abortion often leaves him tongue-tied on the issue.  Would Harris go through periods of savage coverage from a news media that sometimes acts as though its job is to cast Democratic candidates in the worst possible light? Yes. But that will happen to Biden, too.  But Republicans hate her, you might say. That’s true. But they hate Joe Biden, too — and if they didn’t immediately hate anyone who replaced him, they would quickly learn to. There might be Republican-leaning voters who wouldn’t vote in a Trump-Biden matchup but would turn out against Harris, but no one knows if that’s the case or how many of them there are. It’s just as likely, if not more so, that the large number of indifferent or demoralized Democratic-leaning voters who would have sat out a race in which their best option was voting for a feeble Joe Biden would turn out for Harris.  None of this is to say that Harris is a perfect choice or that the race wouldn’t be nail-bitingly close if she were the nominee. But stepping in to save a party in crisis and running against the most dangerous candidate America has ever faced may be her straightest path to becoming president. Sometimes, politics is all about timing — and this most unusual time could be her best chance."

Stop panicking. Replacing Biden on ballots isn't a problem.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-replacement-ballot-access-democrats-rcna162815,"President Joe Biden, after weeks of pressure, has withdrawn from his re-election campaign. In recent days, questions have also been raised about the legal practicalities of Democrats replacing Biden with another candidate, most likely Vice President Kamala Harris. Some have expressed fears that Republicans might attempt to block a Biden replacement from appearing on ballots in November. This is one thing Democrats don’t have to worry about. America’s ballot access laws, the procedures for how candidates are placed on the ballot in each state, are notoriously difficult compared to other democracies’ laws. Experts such as Richard Winger, the longtime publisher of Ballot Access News and the nation’s foremost authority on the topic, have long decried the arbitrarily difficult petition thresholds and discriminatory treatment of third-party and independent candidates. Major-party candidates also run afoul of the rules on occasion. Just this year, former President Donald Trump’s ballot access was imperiled under the 14th Amendment’s bar on insurrectionists before the Supreme Court ruled in his favor. But one thing is clear: There is no credible basis for the claims that the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, whoever that may be, will be kicked off the ballot in any state. As things stand currently, no relevant deadlines have passed. The party remains perfectly free to choose its nominee however it wants, and to choose whomever it wants. Much of the panic stems from claims by the Heritage Foundation (the same organization behind Project 2025) arguing that ambiguities in state election laws could provide an opportunity to challenge a Biden replacement. On the legal merits, these arguments are thin, bordering on specious. But more importantly, they are inapplicable for now. As it currently stands, state Democratic parties wouldn’t be replacing Biden at all, because he is not yet the party’s official nominee. Zack Smith, a senior legal fellow at Heritage, has claimed that “in many states, including in several key states, the deadline for getting on the ballot has already passed.” This is simply untrue, and media outlets should fact-check this assertion rather than taking it at face value. Winger, for good reason, calls much of the coverage about this threat “gullible.” As he notes, “there would be no legal problem in any state.” UCLA professor Rick Hasen, another widely respected election law expert, has also observed “the bottom line is that there is unlikely to be an election law impediment to replacing Biden.” First, it’s worth taking a step back to understand how the Democratic and Republican nominees for president and vice president come to appear on state ballots. In every state, both major parties are qualified for what is known as “automatic” presidential ballot access. In other words, their nominees do not need to gather petition signatures or clear any other hurdles to secure a spot on the general election ballot. Instead, the qualified political parties simply tell the state’s election authorities (in most states, the secretary of state) who its candidates are. This process is never completed prior to the formal nomination by the party’s national convention. With one potential caveat, no state currently requires major parties to certify their presidential ticket any earlier than Aug. 21. Biden is not filed to appear on the ballot in any state at the moment, because he has not yet been formally nominated. The one complication arises in Ohio, which previously had an unusually early deadline of Aug. 7. At the insistence of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, the state Legislature passed a law to accommodate this year’s later Democratic National Convention, scheduled to begin on Aug. 19. Ohio’s new law sets the deadline as Sept. 1. However, the Democratic National Committee remains skittish, noting the contradiction that Ohio’s new law does not actually come into effect until Sept. 1. For this reason, the party had planned to conduct a virtual roll call of convention delegates to formalize the nomination sometime prior to Aug. 7. Even with this wrinkle in Ohio, there is no potential problem. All of the state laws to which Heritage’s commenters have pointed only concern the process for the party to replace one of its candidates later in the calendar, after having previously certified the Biden-Harris ticket. Another concern that has been raised is that the party could be open to litigation for disregarding the results of the primary elections. However, this misunderstands the role of state-run primary elections in the presidential nomination process. The Republican and Democratic parties are not required, and can not be required, to use the primaries at all. The primaries are, in effect, a nonbinding straw poll run by state governments. It is only through the party’s internal rules, as a private organization, that primaries are used to allocate convention delegates among the candidates seeking the nomination. We have already seen both parties decide to ignore state primaries in this election. Democrats did so in New Hampshire, which held its primary too early and out of turn according to the party’s newly adopted schedule. Republicans did the same in Nevada, spurning the state’s primary election in favor of a caucus administered by the party. This presents no legal problem because political parties, in deciding whom to nominate and how, are engaged in their own freedom of speech and association, fully protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has firmly ruled state governments have no power to impose any requirements on how the party conventions function or whom they may choose to nominate. With so much at stake in this year’s election, Democrats are understandably a bit panicked. There are a great many things to be worried about, with the unprecedented reality of an incumbent president dropping out of the race this late, amid serious concerns about his declining mental acuity and physical stamina. But with enough things on their plate to worry about, placing their party’s nominee on the ballot need not be one of them."
Biden is out. Now comes the hard part.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-withdraws-presidential-election-2024-democrats-rcna160452,"We know that America’s two main political parties have very different approaches to public policy. But this historic moment highlights a staggering difference in how the parties pick and treat their leaders. To call Joe Biden’s withdrawal unprecedented is to really sell it short. Yes, there have been cases (including Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968) where presidents have been encouraged by aides and party officials to withdraw due in part to their unpopularity. But those decisions were made long before the candidates’ respective conventions, and with plenty of time for interested party actors to decide on whom the next nominee would be. By contrast, the Democrats have already done the real work of the 2024 nomination. In 2019-2020, the Democratic Party, defined broadly, vetted Biden along with dozens of other candidates through a lengthy series of primaries and caucuses, debates and speeches, meetings, negotiations, and more. Ultimately party insiders determined that they had the most faith in Biden’s ability to both defeat Trump and work toward party priorities on the economy, the environment, labor, student loans, and more. The party’s voters and convention delegates concurred. The lack of a real Democratic Party nomination contest in early 2024 was a sign of another decision; the party remained comfortable with Biden’s progress on the goals it cared about and thought he could continue to work toward those goals in a second term. And again, the party’s voters concurred, and presumably the convention delegates were prepared to re-nominate him. Certainly, prominent people within the party who once thought Biden could win now aren’t so sure. Some voters, too, seem to have changed their minds. But the idea that there can be some sort of final veto stage of this process, after the formal primaries and caucuses are over, is novel — and a little stunning. Contrast this with the Republican Party. Party leaders did not want Donald Trump to be their nominee in 2016, but they ultimately pledged loyalty to him once he won the nomination. They have now functionally nominated him in three consecutive cycles. And any time new damaging information comes out — poor election performances in 2018, 2020, and 2022; helping organize a coup rather than leaving office peacefully; two impeachments; indictments in four separate criminal trials; conviction on 34 felony counts; a multi-million dollar fraud ruling; a court determination that he is liable for sexual abuse; a vow to “terminate” the Constitution, etc. — it only causes the party to support him more. Democrats abandoned their octogenarian leader for seeming cognitively enfeebled and unpopular; Republicans doubled down on their septuagenarian leader for a track record that has gotten increasingly worse with each passing month. Now, the Democrats have work to do. In order for this decision to be proven clever, and not catastrophic, what comes next in the process has to be far better thought out then what came before. If Vice President Kamala Harris is able to swiftly consolidate party support, reassure the constituent groups that were comfortable with Biden that she’d be at least as good on the issues they care about and impress voters and political observers that she has the ability to “prosecute” (her words) Trump in an effective way that brings in votes, this may turn out to be a good use of media pressure and party power. It’s also entirely plausible that Democrats will descend into a massive factional squabble at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, leaving all sides demoralized. In this scenario, Republicans will likely enjoy an even easier election than they would have had otherwise. (We’ve seen that before!) In other words, whether Biden’s withdrawal was a historically good or a historically bad move depends heavily on what comes next. But no matter what happens, it was certainly historic."
Supreme Court reforms could be a fight to the finish line between GOP and Dems,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-reforms-more-seats-rcna162326,"President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse a new package of Supreme Court reforms, a major shift for someone who has been wary about taking on the third branch of government. It’s a welcome move that could finally help rein in a court that has attempted to place itself above the other two branches. It’s also a tacit acknowledgement from Biden that the conservative supermajority isn’t about to temper itself, even as Chief Justice John Roberts publicly frets about the court’s reputation. The changes Biden is considering include “legislation to establish term limits for justices and establishing an updated code of ethics that would be binding and enforceable,” according to NBC News. These are both strong ideas that I wish Biden had endorsed sooner — but they still fall short of what would be the most effective way to transform the court’s workings. It’s long past time for Democrats to accept that the justices are political figures and the Supreme Court is a political arena. Accordingly, rather than run from GOP outrage about “packing the court,” it is in their best interest to campaign on the promise to increase the number of seats on the court. Despite the backlash against President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s failed effort to add Supreme Court seats in 1937 that has kept such proposals at bay, history is well on the side of court expansionists. The size of the court has been nowhere near static over its lifetime. The only requirement on that front under the Constitution is that it have one chief justice. Beyond that, the number of seats has fluctuated over the years, first as the country grew, then as political parties began vying for control over the judiciary. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Supreme Court was established with five associate justices alongside the chief. The act also set up a federal judiciary with three “circuits” that each had two justices assigned to it, along with a district judge. The justices would then “ride circuit,” traveling within their jurisdiction to hear cases, a practice that many early justices absolutely loathed. The number of circuits was soon expanded to six in 1802, requiring a single justice to travel to a smaller area, but only slightly muffling the grumbling from the jurists. Over the next several decades, with the country growing as it expanded westward, so too did the court. By 1807, a seventh circuit was added to encompass Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Another justice was added as well, for the first time tying Supreme Court seats to geographical regions, as the justice was required to reside within one of the three states in the circuit. At its biggest, the Supreme Court consisted of 10 justices to preside over 10 geographical circuits — but in the aftermath of the Civil War, congressional Republicans eliminated the 10th Circuit. Congress also dropped the number of justices to seven to reduce the number of Southerners serving, another point in favor of the size of the court being inherently wrapped up in politics. The court didn’t shrink that much though, as the reduction was meant to take effect as vacancies opened and were left unfilled. Instead, before that could happen, Congress boosted the number into the current total of nine justices in 1869 to align with the nine circuits. That may have been the last major reorganization of the circuit system, but since then two of them have been split in half, giving us the present 11 numbered circuits. Plus, there are two additional unnumbered circuits: the District of Columbia Circuit, which handles cases within the federal capital’s jurisdiction, and the Federal Circuit, a special appeals court that hears cases related to certain administrative areas. At present, each of the nine justices is assigned to at least one of these circuits — Brett Kavanaugh oversees both the 6th and 8th circuits, while Samuel Alito sits over the 3rd and 5th circuits. (Roberts himself sits over the D.C. Circuit and the Federal Circuit.) While justices are no longer required to travel to hear cases within their given territory, they are responsible for handling things like emergency requests and other administrative matters for appeals that come up from their circuits. That’s why you see, for example, Alito’s name on orders to allow an execution to go through in Louisiana. It is therefore entirely reasonable to argue that given the number of issues that certain members of the court must bear, it would be much more equitable to increase the number of justices to share that load. It would just so happen that in doing so, Democrats would be able to rebalance the court after its steady swing to the right over the last several decades. Doing so would shift the court from a 6-3 conservative supermajority to one that has seven liberals and six Republican-appointed justices. There are two interrelated problems, though, that would come from Democrats making this specific argument. First, linking the court’s expansion to the circuits is a move that will work only the once, at least not without a major reorganization of the circuit level. There is a proposal from some Western Senate Republicans to add a 12th Circuit to relieve some of the stress of the 9th, which encompasses the entire Pacific time zone. While that could add yet another justice under a circuit-based setup, this would provide an even number of seats. Should a 12th Circuit ever be established, I think the best course would be to keep the seats at 13, allowing the chief justice to reclaim oversight of the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit. Second, and more important for Democrats in this case, is that timing is key here. Because the court-expansion method I’ve described is entirely constitutional and precedented, it would also be entirely fair for Republicans to pull it off themselves. While some may be content with their current dominance, I’d be shocked to see a GOP trifecta reject cementing an even more unsurmountable grasp on the Supreme Court. And once the viability of this proposal is an accepted fact on both sides, it becomes a race to see who next captures both Congress and the White House and has the political will to carry it out. Democrats squandered their chance to pull this off in Biden’s first two years, even after Senate Republicans held a seat open in President Barack Obama’s final year. Now is the time for Democrats to start laying the groundwork to transform the court at the next possible opportunity."
Don’t be fooled by Trump’s latest gaslighting on abortion,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-abortion-republican-platform-2024-rcna161571,"Donald Trump, his campaign and the Republican Party are in the midst of a transparently dishonest attempt to use the GOP’s 2024 platform, unveiled earlier this month, to transform him into a “moderate” on abortion. Unfortunately, many media outlets have bought into the party’s framing that the new platform “softened” Trump’s abortion stance. Nothing could be further from the truth, and no one should be fooled by this latest Trump deception. “We proudly stand for families and Life,” states the new platform’s brief section on abortion. “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.” (The odd capitalization reflects, as has been reported, that Trump personally edited the document.) In other words, the platform maintains that embryos are people with constitutional rights and must be protected under the law. This idea is the core of a radical anti-abortion movement that seeks to bestow “personhood” rights on fertilized eggs. It’s true that this new platform abandons some of the language of the party’s last platform, from 2016. That platform explicitly called for a national abortion ban and cited the same due process protections to call for “a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to children before birth.” The changes have disappointed some parts of the Christian right. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, in particular, has used his radio show and news site to promote the view touted by himself and other Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, among others, that Trump has unacceptably “watered down” the party’s position. For them, national action, including banning the abortion pill mifepristone, remains a top priority. The new paragraph, however, is a characteristically Trumpian obfuscation, an attempt to please his base and confuse other voters who might have heard claims over the past several months that Trump, supposedly bucking his base, is resistant to a national abortion ban. A casual reader might even see the new platform’s sentence on the 14th Amendment as referring to constitutional rights for people, not embryos. Yet we know from close Trump ally Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, that the former president intends this section to recognize due process rights for embryos. And we also know that the paragraph’s final sentence, opposing “late term” abortions, is meant to signal to the Christian right that a national ban is still on the table. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, confirms the ticket’s anti-abortion bona fides. Vance has compared abortion to slavery, opposed any exceptions for rape or incest in abortion bans, and urged Ohioans to vote against an abortion rights amendment in 2023, arguing it was “not about freedom.” (It passed.) “The Republican Party platform makes clear the unborn child has a right to life that is protected by the Constitution under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment,” Reed wrote. “While aspirational, it applies to both the states and the federal government. The proposed ban on late-term abortion also implies federal as well as state action.” Perkins’ persistence signals that the leaders of the Christian right will not tolerate the party going soft on abortion, and that if Trump regains power they will use their clout within the party to push for the most draconian abortion bans and restrictions possible. In the meantime, criticism from Perkins and others also helps Trump to position himself, preposterously, as bucking his extreme supporters. But no one should forget that Trump has bragged about how “pro-life” his presidency was, particularly his crucial role in appointing three justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump knows his party’s quest to outlaw abortion nationwide is wildly unpopular and a potentially devastating drag on his ability to attract voters beyond his MAGA base. In April, the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a 4-point increase since the Supreme Court struck down Roe two years ago. Last month, Gallup reported that a record 32% of voters said they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion — a position that is “markedly higher among pro-choice voters than it was during the 2020 presidential election cycle, while pro-life voters’ intensity about voting on the abortion issue has waned.” Finally, a Public Religion Research Institute analysis this month similarly found that 37% of voters in seven battleground states said they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion, with Democrats more likely to answer this way (at 46%) than Republicans (at 34%). Leading the way among those litmus test voters are Gen Z voters (47%), who are more likely by at least 10 percentage points than any other generation to say they would only cast a ballot for a candidate who shares their abortion position. Trump’s gaslighting comes amid his base’s march to transform America into a dystopia governed by anti-abortion fanatics, eager to impose their will in hospitals, doctor’s offices and bedrooms. While the 2024 platform may be shorter than its predecessor, newfound brevity does not equal altered ideology. The GOP remains a party of anti-abortion radicals, and no document is going to change that."
George Santos fails to get identity theft charges dismissed from indictment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 2:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/george-santos-fraud-charges-dismiss-rcna162849,"A federal judge has rejected former New York Rep. George Santos’ request to dismiss some of the fraud charges against him, ruling that his motions to dismiss failed to meet the legal standard. Santos’ lawyers had sought to dismiss three of 23 felony charges, including two related to aggravated identity theft. They argued that he was accused of overcharging donors’ credit cards and not of stealing their identities. U.S. District Judge Joanna Seybert tossed out all motions to dismiss in a ruling Friday. The disgraced former House Republican has pleaded not guilty to all counts. His trial is scheduled to begin in September. If convicted, he could face up to 22 years in federal prison. Santos’ tenure in Congress, which lasted just over 10 months, was roiled by controversy even before he was sworn in. In December 2022, The New York Times reported on glaring misrepresentations on his resume and in claims about his background. That led to a series of revelations about his other lies and alleged misdeeds. In May of last year, Santos was charged by the Justice Department in a 13-count indictment; prosecutors filed additional charges against him in October. Then in November, the House Ethics Committee released a report finding that Santos had “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” After two unsuccessful attempts, his House colleagues eventually voted to expel him in December. Legislatively speaking, his track record in office wasn’t a success, either. NBC News reported that all 40 bills he introduced languished in committee without a single vote. Since his expulsion, Santos has tried a number of gambits to claw his way back from irrelevancy. He ran for another New York congressional seat as a Republican, switched to an independent, then ended that campaign as well — all within the space of a few weeks. He joined Cameo, a website for celebrities to make custom short-form videos for a fee; launched subscriptions on X to offer gossip about his former congressional colleagues; and joined the subscription-based social media platform OnlyFans (he said his account would not offer sexual content, as many OnlyFans accounts do, and that he “wanted to stir the pot”)."
Judge rejects Moms for Liberty's request to block protections for LGBTQ students in more than 800 counties,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 11:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/moms-for-liberty-title-ix-lgbtq-students-injunction-rcna162840,"A federal judge on Friday denied a request from Moms for Liberty, a far-right extremist group, to block federal protections for LGBTQ students in more than 800 counties across the country. U.S. District Judge John Broomes, a Trump appointee in Kansas, issued a broad injunction earlier this month that blocks the enforcement of a new Title IX rule to protect LGBTQ students in Kansas and three other states. It also applies to schools attended by children of members of the groups that sued over the rule, Moms for Liberty, Young America’s Foundation and Female Athletes United. Finalized in April, the new rule expands protections under Title IX — a sex discrimination law aimed at protecting women’s rights in education — to include transgender students, whose rights have increasingly come under attack from Republican lawmakers. The rule, which is slated to go into effect on Aug. 1, set off a raft of lawsuits from GOP-led states. At least 15 states have temporarily blocked enforcement of the rule amid legal challenges. Broomes asked the three plaintiff groups to submit a list of schools attended by their members’ children so those schools can be exempt from the rule. But Moms for Liberty said compiling such a list would be “impossible” and that it does not ask its members about their children’s schools. The group instead requested that Broomes block the Title IX rule in any county where its members live, rather than just in schools attended by their children. In his ruling on Friday, Broomes said he did not have the jurisdiction to do so. Had he granted the request, the rule could have been blocked in hundreds of counties, including in those that contain Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco and most of New York City. Broomes gave Moms for Liberty until July 26 to submit a list of schools attended by its members’ children. However, the judge also ruled that the injunction applies to current and prospective members of the three plaintiff groups, “creating the possibility of a constantly expanding injunction,” as the legal blog Law Dork noted."
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee dies at 74,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 8:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sheila-jackson-lee-dies-cancer-texas-rcna162831,"Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a longtime Texas Democrat who championed progressive policies, has died at age 74 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her family announced her death in a statement on Friday. “A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children,” her family said. Jackson Lee had said last month that she was undergoing treatment for cancer. News of her death led to an outpouring of condolences from Democrats and Republicans. Rep. Nancy Pelosi called her a “powerful voice for our Constitution and human rights.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said she was a “proud Texan and a tireless advocate for the people of Houston.” Jackson Lee was first elected to Congress in 1994, and she went on to serve nearly 30 years in the House. She ran for Houston mayor in 2023 and lost in a bruising primary, but she announced her bid for Texas’ 18th Congressional District again shortly after and won. In Congress, Jackson Lee was as a champion for criminal justice reform and reparations for Black Americans. She led the push to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, as well as a rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act to include protections for marginalized groups. She was a household name in her district, The Texas Tribune reported, often attending local graduations, funerals and baby showers. In an interview with local news station KPRC 2 in 2020, Jackson Lee said she hoped to leave behind a legacy of helping others. “If you were in a ditch, I want my story to be that I tried to help you,” she said, “and in many instances, I was successful in helping you and giving back.”"
The MAGA right sent an unmistakable message to trans people at this year’s RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-mtg-rnc-sent-message-trans-people-year-rcna162422,"In the first major speech of the opening night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Sen. Ron Johnson, speaking in his home state, said Democrats’ “fringe agenda includes biological males competing against girls and the sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” a reference to trans athletes and what he sees as liberal support for trans children. Later that  evening, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was even more explicit. “Let me state this clearly: There are only two genders,” she said, as the crowd erupted into cheers. “And we are made in God’s image, amen. And we won’t shy away from speaking that simple truth ever.” Greene has been at the center of multiple transphobic incidents during her congressional career, perhaps most notably when she used signage outside her office to taunt her then-office neighbor, former Rep. Marie Newman, D-Ill., who has a transgender daughter. Sean O’Brien, who this week became the first Teamsters president to attend the convention, later used his social media account to endorse a written piece from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., that included this sentence: “The C-suite long ago sold out the United States, shuttering factories in the homeland and gutting American jobs, while using the profits to push diversity, equity, and inclusion and the religion of the trans flag.” O’Brien’s post was followed by a response from the Teamsters social media account, which said that “unions gain nothing from endorsing the racist, misogynistic, and anti-trans politics of the far right.” But that public rebuke of the Teamsters leader and the Republican senator was deleted. Even former President Donald Trump got in a dig about ""men playing in women’s sports."" Trans pundits and intellectuals have been warning that these days would eventually come. And now they’re here. The party that met in Milwaukee this week is largely unpopular and has few legislative ideas or successes. But it has had success with its anti-trans agenda. Hundreds of transphobic and punitive anti-trans laws have been put on the books throughout red states in the Deep South and Mountain West over the last four years. It’s not surprising, then, that when putting on a national show to tell voters the story of the 2024 Republican Party, transphobia would lead. It’s clear from the rhetoric at the convention that Republicans hope to escalate their state-level attacks on trans rights into a full-blown national campaign. There have been hints that the party’s proposed pornography ban is actually designed to permanently silence trans public figures such as myself and that it seeks to drive trans life completely underground. It’s a terrifying time to be transgender in America, and many of my trans friends who have the means are looking to flee the country should Republicans retake power. We’ve already seen a mass internal migration of trans people and families with trans kids fleeing oppressive red states with vehement anti-trans laws already in force. A Republican takeover of the federal government this fall would turn that migration international. As for me, I’m not leaving. I have kids here and loving family members. I will resist with everything I have until I’m in the ground. We have a phrase in the trans community that I find myself thinking of often these days: “death before detransition.” The phrase couldn’t be more appropriate right now as I stare down the specter of another Trump term and thousands of Republicans who hate people like me potentially taking over the federal government. For trans people in America, this election will shape our individual futures for the rest of our lives. Death before detransition: If conservatives want a country free of trans people, these are my terms."
JD Vance’s revisionist history about who launched America’s failed wars,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-rnc-republicans-iraq-war-rcna162564,"If you listened to Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, on the third night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, you’d think it was Democrats — and President Joe Biden, in particular — who were to blame for thousands upon thousands of combat deaths and postwar suicides of American military personnel who served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. “When I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq,” said Vance, who enlisted in the Marines and served in Iraq, before attending Ohio State and Yale Law. He later added: “From Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the great recession, from open borders to stagnating wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again.” Yes, Biden did vote for the Iraq War. So did a significant number of Democrats on Capitol Hill — including then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, a fateful choice that a younger colleague, the junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, used to assail her during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. But it was then-President George W. Bush who ignored warnings during the summer of 2001 that Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda group was, as the title of a famous memo goes, “Determined To Strike in U.S.” It was Bush, in the thrall of hawkish Vice President Dick Cheney, who spun a fictitious narrative about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. And it was Republican lawmakers who were almost universally in lockstep with the president on his Bush Doctrine, which legitimized the concept of preventive war with its “you’re with us or against us” view of the world. And Republican voters — most of whom have since become MAGA supporters and “America First” foreign policy isolationists, judging by surveys and polls — overwhelmingly supported both. It was Bush who launched the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which led to 7,000 deaths in foreign operations, as well as 30,000 suicides, according to a database kept by Brown University. He condoned torture. And much of it was made possible by the lies his administration told about the supposed need to topple Hussein. The unfocused campaign against Al Qaeda also demanded extending the “Global War on Terror” — with U.S. military action in 22 countries authorized by Congress’ near-unanimous Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which became law just seven days after the 9/11 attacks. (The lone vote against the 2001 AUMF was by a Democrat, Rep. Barbara Lee of California.) Since then, both Republicans and Democrats have tried to clean up the mess he made. Their failure to do so is a testament to the disaster caused by Bush administration hawks who saw 9/11 as the perfect pretext to realize their vision of American power. Obama tried to extricate U.S. troops, only to order “surges” in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while also creating a regime of legally questionable drone warfare. To his credit, Trump moved to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only to leave the job unfinished. Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was legitimately disastrous, and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as his top deputy Jon Finer, should have resigned. They didn’t, with a subsequent Biden administration review of the debacle essentially blaming Trump for the timeline he’d set. Yet it was neither Biden nor Trump who ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to begin with, or mismanaged it to the point that it was sometimes called “the forgotten war,” even as American troops fought and died in it. It was Bush, who was so popular in the wake of 9/11 that the American media made a “rock star” out of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for his feisty press conferences, even as he was failing to take the steps that would have brought Al Qaeda’s leadership to swift justice. And despite presiding over the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor, voters rewarded Bush in the 2002 with a rare sweeping victory for the incumbent president’s party in Congress. The idea that Republican politicians and voters opposed America’s Republican-led war footing in the early 2000s is fanciful, to put it kindly. For all that has happened since then, 9/11 remains the hinge moment for the American project. In one of the most trenchant analyses I’ve read of the terror attacks, columnist Michelle Goldberg of The New York Times wrote in 2021, “The attacks, and our response to them, catalyzed a period of decline that helped turn the United States into the debased, half-crazed fading power we are today. America launched a bad-faith global crusade to instill democracy in the Muslim world and ended up with our own democracy in tatters.” In his powerful book “Reign of Terror,” the journalist Spencer Ackerman draws a direct line between the militarism that began on 9/11 and the assault on American democracy that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. So many other of the nation’s ills — xenophobia, paranoia, polarization, addiction — began with or were accelerated by Bush’s misbegotten war on “evildoers.” But if you listened to Vance’s speech, and watched the reactions of the GOP delegates in the crowd in Milwaukee, you’d never know that it was Republican politicians and voters who pushed America into two long, disastrous wars. Until they acknowledge their own responsibility for the damage those wars caused our reputations — not to mention the lives they took — they don’t deserve to be taken seriously. Then again, maybe being taken seriously is no longer something they crave."
There is no such thing as a ‘new’ Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/jen-psaki-rnc-new-trump-rcna162800,"I have watched a lot of speeches in my life. Donald Trump’s meandering, nearly 90-minute exhibition, which included a mix of self-involved bluster, a gruesome recounting of the assassination attempt on his life and a series of bizarre stories about everything from UFC President Dana White’s vacation to the “late and great Hannibal Lecter,” was simply not a good speech. The entire point of a prime-time address is to speak to an audience broader than your core supporters. These opportunities don’t come along very often for presidential candidates. And yet, I doubt even Trump’s biggest fans were still listening after 45 minutes of garbled drivel. It certainly wasn’t the unifying speech we were promised. Not that I ever really believed Trump could pull off that sort of dramatic pivot. Indeed, Thursday night was just another reminder that every promised reinvention of Trump is bound to be thwarted by Donald Trump himself. So maybe it’s time that we stop buying into it. All of it. And while we’re at it, let’s also stop treating him and the MAGA movement as if it is some insurmountable genius collective. A prime-time convention speech is only as helpful to a campaign as the person delivering it. And Thursday’s speech may go down as one of the worst acceptance speeches delivered by a nominee from either party. On the first night of this year’s Republican convention, Trump selected Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his vice presidential nominee. Vance has billed himself as a “man of the people” who truly understands the struggles of the Rust Belt, but his work addressing Ohio’s opioid crisis tells a different story. When Vance returned to Ohio after working at a San Francisco venture capital fund, he launched the nonprofit Our Ohio Renewal, claiming it would be a “focused effort on solving the opioid crisis.” However, his nonprofit — which he shut down shortly after winning the Republican primary for Senate in 2022 — didn’t fund a single treatment program. In fact, the largest share of the organization’s budget went to “management services” provided by a company that employed Jai Chabria as its executive director. Chabria would later go on to be a senior adviser for Vance’s 2022 Senate run. Additionally, the organization spent $45,000 on polling — but nonprofit staffers told The New York Times they never saw the results. Coincidentally, The Atlantic reported Vance had commissioned a poll to test his viability for a Senate run. Vance later funded a psychiatrist, Sally Satel, to work in Ironton, Ohio. Vance used Satel to bolster his image as a leader in addressing Ohio’s opioid crisis. However, Satel was later found to have financial ties to Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin. With a carefully crafted persona, Vance has gained the support of Trump and simultaneously revealed his true priority: to achieve political gain by whatever means necessary. And that includes exploiting Ohio’s opioid crisis. One of the key figures in the effort to keep Democrats in control of the Senate is Ohio Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Walters.  Last year, Walters successfully led the Ohio Democratic Party’s effort to protect a woman’s right to choose on a statewide ballot initiative. Now, she is currently steering the state party through a crucial election for Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, but her role has become even more significant this week as Trump selected Ohio’s junior senator as his running mate. You can expect to see much more of Walters in the news, breaking down how Vance failed to advocate for the interests of Ohioans during his brief time in the U.S. Senate.

House GOP’s probe into the Trump assassination attempt is doomed from the start,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 4:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-assassination-attempt-house-investigation-secret-service-rcna162784,"Speeches this week at the Republican National Convention didn’t inspire confidence in Republicans’ ability to lead a trustworthy investigation into last weekend’s shooting at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania. House Republicans have begun their probe, but initial responses from many GOP officials suggest that no small number have already concluded that this is a story of anti-Trump violence inspired by liberals. A theory for which, of course, there’s no evidence. In fact, about all we know so far is that the 20-year-old shooter was a registered Republican who apparently made a $15 donation to a progressive cause in 2021 and that he recently made internet searches related to Trump and the Democratic National Convention. Prominent Republicans, nonetheless, sought immediately in the aftermath to frame the shooting as a consequence of liberals’ rhetoric. That includes the vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said: “The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they’ve demonized him [Trump] and his supporters.” The finger-pointing and blame-casting continued at the RNC and its adjacent events, from speakers who were given top billing like Tucker Carlson and Greene, to state legislators like Arizona state Rep. Alexander Kolodin and even run-of-the-mill Republican attendees, like these who spoke with CNN. There was a palpable sense of victimhood at this convention, with many trying to pin the shooting on liberals. So the consensus that’s building on the right points to one potentially insurmountable hurdle for House Republicans’ investigation: their own lack of credibility in leading investigations. With their handling of their dead-end probe into President Joe Biden, House Republicans have already shown that they’re willing to use outright lies from unscrupulous figures when those lies help to bolster their preconceived and politically opportune conclusions. With their bogus hearings on the purported weaponization of government against conservatives, they’ve demonstrated that they have no qualms about using their official positions to spread right-wing propaganda. None of their behavior thus far suggests they wouldn’t attempt something similar in the case of the Trump rally shooting, particularly since so many of them are already on the record with their preconceived conclusion. When it comes to a matter as serious as an assassination attempt, it’s important that Americans broadly feel they’re receiving information from unbiased, credible sources. But in this case, multiple influential Republicans are already behaving like judges who’ve reached a verdict without hearing the actual case. We’ll know in short order whether the cart is again before the horse. The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who ran point on the empty-handed Biden impeachment probe, issued a statement with ranking committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., demanding that Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testify on Monday. Cheatle has accepted the invitation."

In a remarkable drip of defections, some prominent Democrats have urged the president to drop out and have voiced concerns that he cannot win against Donald Trump in November. Others have stopped short of calling for Biden's withdrawal but have warned that Democrats will lose the election if he stays on the ticket. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said he believed Trump and Republicans are currently on track to win the election by a landslide. “So for me, this isn’t a question about polling, it’s not a question of politics. It’s a moral question about the future of our country,” he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also avoided giving a direct answer about whether Biden should stay on the ticket, telling MSNBC's “Morning Joe” that “it’s up to the president to decide” if he will stay on the ticket or not. “We’re all encouraging him to make that decision,” she said. “Because time is running short.” Here's a running list of top Democrats, including sitting members of Congress, who have called for Biden to pull out of the ticket: Hayley Miller contributed reporting.

Joe Biden must break free of his bubble of denial,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 3:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-denial-2024-democracy-trump-polls-rcna162750,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 19 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Donald Trump’s speech during the final night of the Republican National Convention was a missed opportunity. Despite branding it as a call for national unity, the former president failed to change his divisive tone — seemingly tacking on a somber 20 minutes to what was otherwise a standard rally speech. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that from the Republican Party’s point of view, this was a successful convention. This is a very united Republican Party — united behind Trump. They’ve made it clear they’re not going to stand against his extreme agenda. That makes the former president more dangerous than ever before. Right now, Donald Trump has never been stronger, and President Joe Biden has never been weaker.  As the election quickly approaches, we need to take a deep breath and ask ourselves: What’s at stake here? I understand that the president and his folks are feeling angry and betrayed. But ultimately, it’s not about him. It’s about the country. All the signals are blinking, all the alarm bells are ringing, alerting us to the danger we face if Trump retakes the White House. What we’re seeing on the Democratic side, with the effort to replace Biden at the top of the ticket, is a response to that danger.   It’s a reality check, not a betrayal. The problem is not the people saying, “Oh, my God, there’s an iceberg there. We need to avoid the iceberg. Let’s not hit the iceberg.” The problem is the iceberg. It’s crucial that at some point Biden — who, unfortunately, is in a sort of bubble of denial — gets out of that bubble and understands how important it is for his legacy that he be gracious about this. If he steps back, he would do so with the gratitude of a nation, and we could move on to the future. The way this plays out over the coming days and weeks is very important: Will it be embittered? Will Democrats point fingers at one another? Or will they accept that it’s time to move on because the threat of Trump is just so great? Democrats have to resolve this one way or another, and they have to do it very, very quickly."
JD Vance’s foreign policy ideas are Putin and Orban’s dream come true,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 2:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jd-vance-foreign-policy-rcna162608,"PARIS — All of the world’s worst people must have loved JD Vance’s speech Wednesday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and must be taking great comfort in the plan to push America into a new and profoundly isolationist direction. If the U.S., as Vance proposes, retracts from Europe and much of its traditional activities abroad and, not to mention, erects new barriers to commerce and the free exchange of ideas, it would create a vacuum ready to be filled. Who might fill it? Who would profit from the victory of a Trump-Vance duopoly? Start with Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, both of whom have been doing their best to cement Russia’s dominance of Europe’s eastern fringes and fighting every effort to contain Putin’s expanding ambitions. Orban, who just began his six-month rotation as leader of the European Union, and Putin have worked to cement ties with other similarly inclined political forces in Europe and with the GOP in the U.S., led by Donald Trump. “We need to go deeper, occupy positions, gather allies and fix the European Union,” Orban has said. “It’s not enough to be angry. We need to take over Brussels.” They’ve had no shortage of allies in their expanding ambitions in the rest of Europe: newly empowered far-right forces like the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, Marine Le Pen and her National Rally in France, and, in the U.K., the right-wing firebrand Nigel Farage, who showed up in Milwaukee to pay tribute to Trump and Vance. Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can only be delighted by Vance’s expressed support for winning the war in Gaza “as quickly as possible,” which could mean at a great cost to the people of Gaza. In addition to Netanyahu, there are the deeply religious allies of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Iran — smarting over a recently elected reformist president who’s hoping to get sanctions lifted. A Trump administration would be intent on tightening those sanctions. Brazil’s former right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump admirer ousted by a left-wing opponent, is hoping for return to power in Brazil. After the assassination attempt on Trump, Bolsonaro called Trump “the greatest world leader right now” and pledged to be at what he hopes is Trump’s second inauguration in January. Then there’s Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who’s barely hanging on after a recent tight victory. He cherished the close ties he had with Trump, and he is deepening his ties with Putin. And of course, there’s Putin himself. Vance and Trump seem to share similar views on the war in Ukraine. They favor a quick peace deal, with Kyiv ceding substantial territory to Russia if necessary and agreeing to perpetual “neutrality.” Senior European diplomats fear that any such end to the conflict would only fuel Putin’s expansionist ambitions. It was with a deep sense of relief that the European Parliament Thursday bestowed a second five-year term on former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyden as president of the European Commission. She’s a powerful ally of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Indeed, one of the cornerstones of her platform was a pledge to fashion “a true European Defense Union,” with the continent’s first defense minister, part of Europe’s efforts to Trump-proof its security. This strain of American isolationism is associated with some of the most destructive periods in America’s past. Historically, the U.S. has never done well by disengaging from the world, putting up high tariff walls and avoiding armed conflicts abroad. In the early 20th century, Senate Republicans, bitterly opposed to the Versailles Treaty negotiated by President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, succeeded in rejecting the pact and keeping the U.S. out of a League of Nations that the treaty would have established. That act of isolation laid the foundations for the rise of Hitler in Germany and the onset of World War II. The deeply protectionist Smoot Hawley Tariff, enacted in 1930 and immediately drawing retaliation from its target countries, only intensified the Great Depression at home by slowing demand for American goods and sharply raising the prices of all imports. In turn, the tariff accelerated Hitler’s rise to power. The America First movement, launched at Yale Law School in 1940 (decades before Vance attended) advocated an end to military aid to Britain and staying out of World War II.  The group, more than 800,000-strong and encompassing such luminaries as Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh, argued that buffered by two broad oceans America would be safe if it remained isolated. That group disbanded two days after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Despite that historical record, the similar America First doctrine proclaimed by Vance and Trump appears to be the cornerstone of their foreign policy alongside economic populism. “No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,” Vance declared Wednesday. Trump spent his entire first administration seeking to unravel NATO, demanding that allies pay more for their defense, while withdrawing from a host of international treaties. In Europe, where I’m writing this from, the panic is palpable. As the Economist’s Charlemagne column — written, as it happens, by a direct lineal descendant of the 8th century Carolingian emperor — observed: “In Brussels and beyond, the mere prospect of a Trump-Vance combo in the White House ought to add urgency to the debate about Europe’s future.”  Indeed, it ought to add urgency on both sides of the Atlantic, as the future of the U.S. is also in play."

The cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said Friday that the outages were the result of one of its routine software updates gone wrong, and was ‘not a security incident or cyberattack.’” * Indefensible: “American journalist Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security prison by a Russian court Friday after he was found guilty of espionage in a case that his employer, The Wall Street Journal, and the U.S. government have condemned as a sham.” * The ICJ: “Policies and practices used by Israel in its occupation of Palestinian territories are in breach of international law, the United Nations’ top court said in a landmark opinion Friday. The International Court of Justice said in its opinion, which was read out by Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the world body, that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as ‘the regime associated with them,’ were established and are being maintained in violation of international law.” * Alabama’s latest mass shooting: “An Alabama man is accused of fatally shooting his wife and four children inside their home overnight, according to officials with the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Alabama District Attorney’s Office.” * I wonder if Trump would pardon Tyler Bradley Dyke: “A far-right extremist who already served time for his role in the racist 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville in 2017 was sentenced to more than four years in federal prison Friday for stealing a police shield and twice using it against officers during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.” * If it seems as if many world leaders fear Trump’s return, but are starting to prepare for it anyway, it’s not your imagination: “Top foreign officials courted Donald Trump’s allies during the Republican National Convention, scoring face time and last-minute invites — all in order to build relationships if the former president returns to office. Foreign officials were caught off guard when Trump won the White House in 2016, and they don’t want to find themselves flat-footed again.” * On a related note: “Mexico’s president called Donald Trump ‘a friend’ Friday and said he would write to the former U.S. president to warn him against pledging to close the border or blaming migrants for bringing drugs into the United States.” Have a safe weekend."
Trump says leave abortion to the states. Texas nearly killed my wife.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 2:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-abortion-law-trump-stance-miscarriage-rcna161130,"My wife says she doesn’t feel right. She’s almost 13 weeks pregnant with our second child. She is bleeding and has severe abdominal pain. We live in rural Texas, where options are limited. At the nearest emergency clinic, my wife goes inside alone, while I wait in the truck with our 9-month-old daughter. We learn the fetal heartbeat stopped about a week ago. Unless you’ve been there yourself, it’s impossible to fathom the devastation we feel. We’re told there’s a high risk of infection if we don’t act fast. We have two options. One is a procedure called “dilation and curettage,” which removes the contents of the uterus. The other is a take-home pill called misoprostol, which causes the pregnancy to be expressed. Both options are the standard of care for people with incomplete miscarriages like my wife’s, and though a D&C is used in some abortions, the procedure is legal in Texas if there’s no fetal cardiac activity detected. Yet the practitioners at the clinic refuse to perform it. Instead, they write her a prescription for misoprostol. It’s too late for me to go to the pharmacy tonight. At home, my wife tries to sleep, but I’ve never heard her cry like this. She cries all night. I’m first in line when the pharmacy opens, and I grab the small paper bag of misoprostol. It can cause bleeding and cramping while it helps flush the uterus. My wife is a strong Texan woman, but the pain proves almost unbearable. We call the emergency clinic for guidance. Because my wife is expelling bright-red blood, not brown, the medical staff explains the pill isn’t working. Though proven effective, misoprostol — like any medication — doesn’t work for everyone. We need another option.  My wife hasn’t slept. She’s still bleeding. We call the emergency clinic as soon as they open. We learn misoprostol can sometimes take two or three attempts to fully work. They ask us to come back in. There’s a new doctor this time, an older man. He’s aware of my wife’s incomplete miscarriage and history of care. My wife hears him huffing outside the exam room: “I’m not giving her some pill so she can go home and have an abortion.” Then he comes in and says he won’t prescribe her the pill “considering the current stance.” He doesn’t mention a D&C. Even the nurse is visibly shocked. We call another hospital — farther away, but one we trust. For the third time this weekend, my daughter and I sit in the truck outside a hospital while I clutch my phone, waiting for updates. Inside, my wife has to start the process all over again — new scan, new questions, more poking and prodding — only to reconfirm what we already know. Then, the strangest thing happens. The medical staff disappears. For hours. When the doctor finally returns, she deems my wife’s condition “not enough of an emergency” to perform a D&C. If we want the procedure, the soonest we can get it is at least a week away. The staffers know my wife is still bleeding. They know there’s been no fetal heartbeat for over a week. They know the risks of infection and sepsis. But they don’t want to risk criminal prosecution. Because in Texas, they can now face a $100,000 fine or life in prison for inducing anything that could be interpreted as an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. They write her another misoprostol prescription and send us home. The dosage is much stronger, with no refills. At this point my wife has been bleeding — bright red — for 48 hours. The medication doesn’t work. Overnight, nothing improves. My wife asks for a heated blanket and a pillow. She lies on the bathroom floor, her visage gray and her skin clammy. For the first time I catch myself thinking, Is she going to die? As I check on our daughter, I look down at my phone and see a missed call. I race back to find my wife unconscious on the floor, a red trail running from the toilet into the pool of blood she’s lying in. I’ll never forget lifting her cold, limp body off that bathroom floor, yelling, “Can you hear me?!” I place our daughter in the car seat and my wife in the passenger seat — still unconscious, still bleeding. Hazards on, I drive to the hospital as fast as I feel comfortable. I sprint through the emergency entrance and scream for help. Staff rushes out. They wheel my wife inside on a stretcher. As I hold our little girl and numbly fill out paperwork, a nurse approaches.  “Thank God you brought her when you did,” she says. Her attempt at reassurance infuriates me. I guess my wife was finally close enough to death to deserve help. My wife survived, but we’re not out of the woods. As I write this, she is once again looking at a positive pregnancy test. She may need a D&C for this new pregnancy, and we have no faith in the doctors here in Texas to provide it. If I have to take her to another state, I will. Make no mistake: The disgraceful lack of care she endured was a direct result of Texas’ deadly new abortion law. Leaving abortion laws up to the states, as Donald Trump promises to do, is not a moderate stance. Doctors are scared and confused. Patient health can no longer be their top priority. Now, it’s avoiding prosecution."
Convening and Kvetching,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-convening-kvetching-rcna162760,"This podcast is all about winning in November, so how does that happen in the political climate of this volatile week? The narrative from Democrats has been evolving each day– so Former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri walk us through it. Then, The Bulwark’s managing editor Sam Stein stops by, after a week on the ground in Milwaukee for the GOP Convention. They note several strange themes that emerged from the gathering of Republicans, as well as the disconnect between JD Vance’s worldview and Trump’s. But the biggest takeaway was the importance of not losing sight of the stakes this November, as Democrats figure out a path forward.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, welcome to How to Win 2024. It’s Friday, July 19th. I’m Jennifer Palmieri and here with my co-pilot Claire McCaskill, who’s back after a week of vacation, but I feel like I’ve seen you so much that I don’t feel like you’ve been on vacation at all. Claire McCaskill: I don’t feel like I’ve been on vacation at all. To tell you the truth, I’m flat worn out. Jennifer Palmieri: I barely remember you being gone, but I guess you were gone. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I was gone and believe me, I was tempted to stay gone. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Claire McCaskill: And you know, we have a conversation here every week and I think it’s really important to say at the very top of this week, how emotionally difficult it is for anybody who cares deeply about this process. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: This is really hard stuff. I mean, President Biden is my friend. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, me too. Claire McCaskill: And I think people that are out there screeching online one way or the other, I think we got to just take a moment to realize that the reason this is so hard is because it’s painful, emotionally painful. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s wrenching, it’s emotionally painful, and also it’s such a close call, you know, you feel like the current option isn’t working, but you open door number one and like, what are you unleashing into the world, right? So after the debate, that first weekend when everybody was like, oh, he’s going to drop out, you know, he’s not going to drop out. He’s going to drop out 48 hours after the debate, like, nor should we want him to, like none of that, you know. It’s going to take at least three weeks to sort this out and that’s going to be painful, but that’s okay because you got to get it right and you got to make the best decision you can because of everything that’s at stake. And people talk about, there’s all this infighting of Democrats, it’s like, no, that’s not what’s happening. Claire McCaskill: No, that’s not. Jennifer Palmieri: No, what it is, is people are trying to figure it out. People are trying to figure out how’s he doing? Is he up to this? What’s the right thing to do? What’s the responsible thing to do given what’s at stake? And I’m just like grateful that we have the kind of leaders that we have in the House and Senate from Schumer and, you know, Leader Jeffries in the House and obviously Pelosi to kind of help navigate this with their caucuses and understand where they’re coming from and have the credibility to go to the president and tell them what they really think what’s right. Claire McCaskill: You know, I was thinking about the name of our podcast and the reason that there is so many gut-wrenching discussions and difficult decisions to make is because of the name of this podcast. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: It is just everyone is unified around the concept of winning this election. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And it’s just people have honest disagreements about how to do it. And that shouldn’t be evil. Those that are maintaining that it’s a huge mistake for Biden to move off the ticket, I get it. Those who believe it’s absolutely horrible to think that Biden would remain at the top of the ticket, I get it. And that’s because there’s no easy or simple answer here. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: So we’re going to talk more about all of that. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We’re also going to talk with Sam Stein, managing editor at “The Bulwark,” who was on the ground in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention. We want to take a hard look at Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, what themes, if any, emerged from Trump’s official coronation other than macho, macho man, and remind people what the stakes are if he’s reelected. So let’s go gut check, if I were in the room. First, we need to acknowledge the -- Jennifer Palmieri: Well -- Claire McCaskill: -- the unity the whole country has about the near assassination of Donald Trump and how -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my God. I mean, I still can’t even believe that happened. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s almost so shocking that we can’t even absorb it. It’s like, you know, it was absorbed in a day. It felt like it was going to have a huge impact on the race. I think it was a very sobering, scary thing and you realize how tenuous this all is, right? You know, the democracy, how we’ve been lucky that rhetoric hasn’t provoked as much, you know, that we haven’t seen more of this, frankly, you know? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and listen, I recall no one being irresponsible, anybody who’s been in an elected position or is doing the kinds of things we do every day, Jen. I don’t think anybody has been irresponsible in the way they’ve talked about this. I will say that we do know that the shooter was researching on his phone, not just Trump, but also Biden and also the Democratic National Convention. So this is not somebody, I mean, who’s registered Republican. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: So I do think it’s irresponsible for anyone on the right or the left to try to ascribe to either candidate that they’re totally responsible for this. I do think that Donald Trump has gone places that presidential candidates typically have not gone in terms of how he has talked about political violence. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And so I’m not going to sit by and accept from the Republicans that this was the Democrats trying to kill Donald Trump or that they are responsible because of their rhetoric. That is not fair. And I don’t think we have to accept that while still being very respectful of the danger that Donald Trump faced and how glad we are that he avoided serious injury. Jennifer Palmieri: My God, yeah. Okay, because it’s just been so stunning, we’re going to talk about the evolution of the week. So that happened Saturday night, Sunday, is sort of us processing the assassination attempt. Then you have the Lester Holt interview that was on Monday, and even that feels like -- Claire McCaskill: A year ago. Jennifer Palmieri: -- year ago, right. Well, what’s your impression of that? I mean, that was not great. It was not great. Claire McCaskill: It was not great. I mean, he did pivot and punch a little bit about all of Trump’s lies during the debate, which was good. But -- Jennifer Palmieri: But. Claire McCaskill: But -- Jennifer Palmieri: But they are, you know, obviously confused during parts of the interview, not following the thread of the conversation. So that happened on Monday. And then Wednesday happens, and I feel like that’s where it all starts to change. You know, Adam Schiff comes out, a close ally of Nancy Pelosi’s. And I’m going to step back to say I am not operating from independent knowledge. I’m stringing things together as someone with experience and an interested observer. I see a week ago Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi does her shot across the bow on “Morning Joe,” right? She says the president needs to make a decision, even the president’s already made a decision and time is running out. Then Thursday, last week, there’s the press conference after NATO. After the press conference, Hakeem Jeffries goes to the White House right away to talk to the president. We know that a lot of people in the caucus have concerns about him staying. Puts out the statement Friday morning that does not endorse Biden staying in the race. And then we find out this Wednesday, after Schiff goes, we find out that Senator Schumer actually went to Rehoboth last Saturday prior to the assassination attempt to also deliver a very tough message. And then we see it is revealed to us on Wednesday that the whole House and Senate leadership has already spoken to the president to express their very serious concerns. And obviously, if they had some conclusion other than they thought that he should stay in the race, they would have said so. But that is not what they said. Claire McCaskill: And I think, first of all, it really is irritating to me. I’m so glad you talked about the leadership in the House and the Senate -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- because one of the things that’s really irritating to me is that people think that somehow there’s a room somewhere and these big elite leaders get in that room and go, oh, okay, let’s just kneecap Joe Biden. No. Jennifer Palmieri: For better or worse -- Claire McCaskill: No. Jennifer Palmieri: -- there’s no smoke filled room, people. Claire McCaskill: No. Jennifer Palmieri: There’s no one actually in charge. There’s not 12 people somewhere deciding all this. That is not happening. Claire McCaskill: And let me pull back the curtain on what has actually happened behind the scenes. Very quietly and very methodically, there was a decision made by important elected officials in our party that we needed to give Joe Biden time, space and grace, as many have said, to hopefully figure out on his own with the help of his family and close staff that maybe exiting the race was going to be a good thing. That did not happen. So I think most of the battleground state Senate candidates waited seven to 10 days before going into the field with a poll because you want to wait, Jen, as you know -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- at least a week after an event to begin polling to see if it’s had an impact. And they ask questions like, would it impact your vote for, let’s just say, hypothetically, Jackie Rosen if she continued to assert on the campaign trail that Joe Biden was capable of serving out another four and a half years as president. And they had those numbers. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And all of these battleground state Senate candidates, which we have to win the Senate -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- they are in a position -- Jennifer Palmieri: And it’s not like self-interested, like, all I care about is my race. That’s not what’s happening. Claire McCaskill: No, that’s not it. That’s not it. Jennifer Palmieri: That is not it. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And for many of these battleground states, I will just tell you the internal polling had a significant swing. I’m not going to name which candidates, but there was internal polling, for example, that had a candidate who was two up before the debate, who’s three down after the debate. That’s five points swing. That is huge in a battleground state. And I -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. With a race like this where everything is so locked, that is a very big deal. Claire McCaskill: And if you’re campaigning in a tough state, one or two points is the world. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, I used to always say in my races, 46 is easy, 49 is really hard. I can get to 46 in my sleep. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: But 49 is really like climbing 16 Mount Everest. So two points is a huge thing to these battleground state Senate candidates. And Schumer is just carrying the data. He is doing what his job is, is representing millions of Americans who have elected these senators and these senators who want to be re-elected to give this information to the president United States. It’s not any more complicated than that. And I’ve never seen, never seen the kind of swings we now have in these battleground states where there’s an average of 12 points difference between Biden’s numbers and the Senate candidate numbers. That’s crazy time. You don’t see that. That is like the house is on fire we need another fire brigade here to put it out. So I just don’t think it’s fair to these leaders to be castigated the way they have by some in our party for doing their jobs. That’s all they’re doing is their jobs. They’re representing the people in their caucus. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And it’s not even just their jobs as like the Democratic leaders. It’s their jobs as constitutional officers. They are, you know, particularly in the House of Representatives, it is the people’s body. And Leader Jeffries is talking with every member of his caucus and they are representing what they’re polling is showing, but also just what they’re hearing in their districts. And these leaders are going to the president United States to, you know, this is how it’s supposed to work to say not just we have political concerns, but it’s like the stake of losing to Trump, if that’s a likelihood or real possibility, the stake of not having the House of Representatives or not having the Senate when you’re going to be dealing with a Trump administration. And I think that they have handled it so well. And, you know, trying to not inflict any damage on the president. Claire McCaskill: I also want to make this point. There is something that most, not all, but most of the people that are in elected positions that have come out full throated that Biden should not leave the ticket are in very safe seats. Jennifer Palmieri: You’re right. They’re in very safe seats. Claire McCaskill: They can’t imagine their wildest dreams ever being beaten by a Republican. And it is a different animal, I just tell you. All the people yelling at me doesn’t bother me because I’ve been yelled at for 40 years about half the people in my state. Jennifer Palmieri: Democrat in Missouri, man. What are you going to do? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, exactly. So the point is that if you are in a safe seat, it feels different to you than if you are battling out for every scrap of a vote you can get. And that’s how we make majorities. We make majorities in the middle. We don’t make majorities on the ends. We make it in swing districts in the House and we make it in states that are capable of voting for either D’s or R’s in the Senate. And that’s why this is also important. I mean, if we were in the room, obviously, the campaign -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- still needs to be doing contrast constantly. And they’re doing that -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- because we have to keep pushing how bad Trump is, because even if it is not Joe Biden, that message is universal to our party at this point. Jennifer Palmieri: And the thing is, the big thing I think that comes if I were in the room, the Republican convention started strong, but it ended with one conclusion. Wow, this guy is beatable, right? I mean, it was just Trump was so low energy, unfocused, if he can’t attack Biden, he has nothing to say. And you come out of it thinking like, wow, these guys offered nothing. He is unfocused and very beatable and just go after them hard on Project 2025, abortion and democracy. And, you know, the vice president, frankly, has been very effective in doing that. She could do that and the degree to which the president is if the president is staying in, just do that. Just talk about that. Make this a referendum on Trump. Yes, the Biden campaign has got a lot to be proud of, but like we don’t have time to do that anymore about accomplishments. It’s like go, go, go on the referendum on him. Claire McCaskill: Exactly. So we’re going to take a quick break here. When we’re back, Sam Stein, managing editor at “The Bulwark” joins us from Milwaukee to give his impressions of where this convention began and where it wound up. Back with Sam in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. This week, the 2024 Republican National Convention was in full swing in Milwaukee. But what a difference a week makes. Republicans now have a vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, and a very unified Republican Party that rallied around Trump as their guy and MAGA as their platform just days after the shocking attempt on his life. Claire McCaskill: So how did it wind up? Sam Stein has been on the ground in Milwaukee this week. I really feel like we don’t even need to introduce Sam Stein. Most of you know who he is. He is somebody who likes to talk about this stuff like we do and is very, very good at it. He had a front row seat at the convention and he joins us now. He is managing editor at “The Bulwark” and formerly “Politico’s” deputy managing editor for politics. He is also a fellow MSNBC contributor. So he knows why I have no makeup on today, because I have been up for “Morning Joe” and at 30 Rock until after midnight for several days in a row and I just went on strike this morning and said not an ounce of makeup is going to touch my face. Sam Stein: No, you look great, Claire. Jennifer Palmieri: You look great. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, okay. So, let’s talk about the convention. First of all, I want to start by quoting George Bush. That was some weird shit. George Bush from Trump’s 2020 or -- Sam Stein: 2016.   Jennifer Palmieri: 2017 inaugural. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- inaugural, exactly. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Claire McCaskill: So what was it like inside the hall? Did it feel as unified as it looked? Sam Stein: Yeah. I mean, yes, I can confirm it was weird shit, but in the hall it was a very unifying element to it. I mean, they adore the guy, right? Like it’s not just politics. There’s like, you know, there’s a culty element to it. And then obviously in the in the wake of this assassination attempt, there’s a religious element to it now in a way that really, you know, there had been some of that, but it’s been taken to a new level. And throughout the convention over the last three days, especially, you’ve seen people talk about Trump in these sort of providential tones, and which is ironic because the entire convention prior to the assassination attempt was structured to be very secular. Like they had pushed aside the social conservative agenda. They had very few speakers who were from the religious faiths. It was a really secular agenda. And then because of this, it became different. In terms of the mood inside the hall, I think, to a person, they basically are of the belief that he will win. The confidence level was oozing through the attendees. I spent a good chunk of yesterday just talking to delegates around the floor, asking them a very sort of simple, unscientific survey on a scale of one to ten, one being convinced he will lose and ten having the utmost certainty that he will win, where do you stand? Here’s some of the results. New York delegation. I got four 10s, one 12. Alabama delegation, two 10s, three 11s. Illinois delegation, a 12. Pennsylvania, three 10s and 11. I got a nine there. That was one of the two nines. Colorado, a nine, but only because they were worried it might be stolen. I mean, this is the stuff you’re talking about. And so, you know, it sets up the situation where basically people were having an incredibly joyous time. There were conga lines, dancing, things like that. Does that mean they’re overconfident? Maybe. Does it set up a situation where if they do lose that we have, you know, an incredibly suspicious and maybe angry electorate on that side? Yeah, it does. You know, I think Trump’s obviously the favorite candidate here, but I don’t think it’s out of the realm of reason that he could still lose this election. Jennifer Palmieri: And what about, I mean, it’s interesting to see what they presented and what they had planned to present, right? After the shooting, they said that they were going to have a, you know, a unity agenda. What’s his face? Who’s the doofus that’s like, yeah, they loaded my old speech. Sam Stein: Ron Johnson, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin had a fiery speech. Claire McCaskill: By the way, a really intellectual heavyweight. I can speak from serving with him. I mean, the saying, not the brightest light in the marquee was designed for him. Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s like, yeah, I had a toned down speech, but they didn’t load it into the teleprompter -- Sam Stein: They just put the wrong one in there. Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: They put the wrong one in there. Yeah. Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. So, what do you? They had a plan to do. Did they change it? And what actually happened? Because it kind of like, I’m not sure that anything emerged from this, any sort of compelling narrative emerged -- Sam Stein: Oh, no. Claire McCaskill: -- from this convention other than Trump was saved by the hand of God. Sam Stein: God, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: No, I totally agree with you, not just about Ron Johnson. I was struck by how little narrative there was or narrative arc there was. I mean, if you watch J.D. Vance’s speech, you know -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- I don’t know who put it together. It was disjointed. It went back and forth between his bio and random issues. And in Trump’s speech last night was long. There wasn’t really a credible thematic underpinning to it. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: I mean, this convention basically was, it was reshuffled because of what happened. The whole idea that it was a unity convention, I think is silly. The unity was -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- let’s unify as Republicans and be Democrats. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: That was the unity. Oh, the other unity was let’s drop these investigations and probes into my conduct for the good of the country. But if you had to pick out a couple of themes, I guess one was, you know, Trump is here to save us and the other was immigrants are bad. And -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- the entire speech last night, he kept coming back to immigrants. Like it didn’t matter the topic, you know, social security, immigrants are going to steal it from you. Jobs, immigrants are going to steal it from you. Fentanyl, immigrants are going to bring it to you. I mean, it was just a very nativist anti-immigrant speech. I think that’s, if you’re talking just pure policy, that is the one main through line for all of this stuff is we got to close the borders and we got to drill more oil. That’s it. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And, you know, it’s fascinating to me because maybe this is cause I’m a, I’m a woman that I felt this, and maybe I’m looking too carefully, but it felt like also there was a theme that, you know, let’s celebrate men. Sam Stein: Oh yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know, when Trump came out night before last to the theme, it’s a man’s world. And then that Hulk Hogan shit. Oh my God. And you know, it’s really hard for me, Sam, because I think of the Republican party conventions. I mean, I’ve gone to a lot of conventions, right? And I think frankly, mostly they’re a leftover artifice from another time that is unnecessary. And by the way, the numbers for this convention were not good in terms of people watching it. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, they thought they were getting young men by all of this macho shit. Young men weren’t watching. I got news for him. I looked at the numbers from the night J.D. Vance gave his speech. First of all, 5 million fewer viewers watched J.D. Vance than watched Pence in 2016. And secondly, the demographic, I mean, I think it was 14 million people for J.D. Vance and of that 14 million, 12 million of them were over 65. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Right. Claire McCaskill: So it gives you how skewed the audience that he was looking for was to older. And, you know, you would think they’d want to appeal to women at this point in some way, but instead -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- they are all in, and this has always been him, right? That I just need more MAGA. I don’t need to worry about suburban women. There’s two things that they didn’t want to talk about at this convention, Mike Pence and abortion. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: So, no, it’s such an astute observation. We had a story up yesterday from my colleague, Mark Caputo, and basically, you know, for like weeks and months, we’ve been consuming these stories that the Trump campaign is, you know, trying to win over African-Americans and Hispanics, and they’re making inroads into the coalition, but Mark’s piece was sort of a course corrector, and it was saying, no, in fact, they’re trying to juice white male turnout, like they think they can just absolutely juice white male turnout, and they had lost a little bit of the white male margins from 2016 to 2020, and they felt like that’s why Biden won, and maybe so. Claire McCaskill: Right. Sam Stein: And so they wanted to win those back. And this convention was essentially designed around that. Now, of course, don’t talk about abortion because you don’t want to cause harm to your campaign. But if you look at just the speaker lineup, Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Dana White, I mean, this is just let’s get like men to like salivate over this. The issues are what you point out, which is it’s not just white men. It’s sort of generationally how you divide those white men, right? Like older white men, younger white men. And if you’re banking a lot on younger white men to come out and vote for you, you have to be able to reach them. And that’s not always sure because young people don’t really pay attention to the stuff. The one place where I might add a caveat to what you said, Claire is on viewership. Yes, the numbers are down and I, you know, that’s clear. And yes, this is a relic of the past, but their sense, the Trump people sense is that people will view small, shorter packaged clips of this. The reason you have Hulk Hogan do the intro speak is not because you’re reaching people through TV and they’re going to see him. It’s because someone will package Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt on the convention floor to reveal Trump-Vance. And that will be shared in the mediums that younger white men get their news from as opposed to TV. And so that’s what they’re banking on. I do think there’s a little risk in saying, hey, we can reach these younger voters and turn them out. As you and Jen know, it’s like they don’t always vote. Claire McCaskill: It’s harder than it looks. Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It’s harder than it looks. We’re going to make you stick around for another segment here in a minute -- Sam Stein: Love it. Claire McCaskill: -- but we need to talk a little bit about J.D. Vance and you know, there is a, such a disconnect between Donald Trump doing an interview with “Business Insider” and the days before the convention, promising more corporate tax cuts, wanting to put a sign of Wall Street, the Secretary of Treasury, you know, speaking just to CEOs. I mean, he loves, he has always longed to be among those guys and he wants those guys, by and large, they are guys, to love him, the business community. And then you have J.D. Vance getting up there and basically saying, we are going to come and mesh you up Wall Street. We are in your face and you are done. I mean, how in the world do they sell? How does J.D. Vance get around the fact that what Trump talks about more than anything else is making sure he once again, lowers the corporate tax rate? Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: I don’t know. It’s been interesting to see them try to do this economic populist stuff while also keeping a foothold in the CEO world. As has been reported, CEOs, Fox News were not on the Vance train. They did not want him as the pick. They liked Doug Burgum. I think there’s obvious reasons why Vance doesn’t speak their language or at least doesn’t pretend to speak their language, but you know, Trump’s -- Claire McCaskill: He doesn’t pretend to speak their language is correct. Sam Stein: -- Trump is also like done this for eight years, right? He presents himself as the champion of the working man, but he doesn’t actually put together a policy portfolio that would suggest that’s what he wants. Of all the speakers this week that were intriguing to me, I thought it wasn’t Vance. It wasn’t Trump. It was Sean O’Brien. It was the Teamsters president who got up there and was talking about, you know, in roads with Republicans on working class issues. Every single Republican, including Vance, they don’t support the PRO Act. They didn’t support the bill, the COVID relief bill that included the massive pension relief for the Teamsters. I mean, I understand why Vance and Trump try to have it both ways. That’s sometimes what politicians do. And you try to win coalitions and try to bridge people together. What I don’t understand is how union leaders could pretend that that’s not happening. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And most of them aren’t. I mean, and even Sean O’Brien may end up endorsing the democratic ticket -- Sam Stein: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- whatever it may be. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And I think people are underestimating how much Sean O’Brien is playing inside politics within the Teamsters. Sam Stein: Interesting. Claire McCaskill: Sean O’Brien is trying to hold onto the presidency. I mean, once you get one of those jobs, man, you want to hold on to it tightly. And he has watched and he knows. The way you keep your membership supportive of you is to pay attention to the fact that he’s got a whole shitload of members who are Trumpers -- Sam Stein: Who like Trump. Claire McCaskill: -- who are Trumpers. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I think that was just a play for his membership, but ultimately I would be shocked if he endorses that ticket. Especially if we have a different ticket. Sam Stein: We’ll see. Claire McCaskill: We’ll see, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: All right. So we’re going to take a quick pause here, but Sam Stein is going to stick around. When we’re back, more on what the Republican convention reveals about the goals of the party and how the race is shaping up against what I want to charitably call the somewhat big mess on our side of the aisle. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. Sam Stein is still with us. Okay, Sam. So we are post-convention. It’s Friday morning. Beyond all of the unity and Kumbaya, there are some real issues in front of the voters this fall. So let’s talk through a few. Project 2025, abortion, and there seemed to be a full embrace of Trump’s criminal convictions painted both as a fighter and a victim. And then there’s the question of democracy. And would this coalition accept the results? So that’s kind of a little menu for us to dive through Project 2025. Did you feel like you saw an embrace of that, an attempt to distance it? Also, I don’t think, I mean, it matters to some degree, but the Democrats are definitely going to make them own Project 2025. And certainly the J.D. Vance pick sort of cements that. What’s your take? Sam Stein: There’s an obvious attempt to pretend as if that thing didn’t exist, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, right. Sam Stein: Complete disavowal prior to the convention, which of course had the, what is it, the Streisand effect or whatever it is, where you like just draw more attention to it. But, you know, I think the, the instructive case here is like how they put together their platform, which tells you everything about how they feel about policy. The platform was just completely shaved down into a page and a half or whatever. Jennifer Palmieri: That was pre-assassination attempt, right? Sam Stein: Yes, exactly. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Sam Stein: And you know, there was no mention of any of the social conservative issues. The abortion stuff was more or less put to the side. No, you can make the case that like Trump is acting astutely, right? That’s what you do when you want to win is you try to just hide -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: -- everything that’s bad and you tell your people to like go pound sand. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: And that’s what happened. And I was a little surprised at how little dissension was evident on ideological grounds here over the weekend, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: You know, obviously different times and different eras, but you know, 2016 convention Republican side was defined by people literally trying to stage, not a coup, but an insurrection against his nomination on the convention floor, right? And 2020 was defined by COVID, so that was totally weird, but you would expect to a degree that, you know, the pro-lifers here would have put up more of a fuss or that the hawks would have said, hey, why are we picking J.D. Vance? The guy basically wants to get out of, you know, and stop the fighting against Russia and Ukraine. None of that. And this just goes to show you that everything in this moment in time for Republican parties not have built around any sort of cohesive ideology. It’s built around, you know, appreciation for a personality. Jennifer Palmieri: And particularly since it was his third nomination -- Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: -- you know. I don’t think we appreciate that. I don’t know that that’s ever happened before that somebody has gotten three nominations in a row of a major political party. Sam Stein: There’s been Richard Nixon who had three conventions. I don’t think it was in a row. Jennifer Palmieri: But that you’d be like, okay, we have another shot at this. What’s the big agenda that we want to get through? The only speech that I felt hung together sort of thematically was Eric Trump’s. Sam Stein: Interesting. Jennifer Palmieri: Because Eric Trump gave the grievance speech. Sam Stein: Right, right. Jennifer Palmieri: Eric Trump gave the speech they normally would give, but I think they probably, because J.D. Vance’s speech didn’t hang together at all either. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Trump’s speech was like, not just a normal rally speech, but one of the lower energy rally speeches I’ve ever seen him give. And then J.D., I think maybe it was because they were trying to thread the needle of like not being too partisan and sowing too much division, but they don’t know how to do that. Like they have two speeds. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Like low energy Trump or grievance Trump. Sam Stein: And the sort of other maybe slightly more charitable explanation is that they just didn’t want to rock the boat, right. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: They’re up. Don’t do anything provocative. Don’t like rail against political prosecutions, although that came up frequently, just play it safe. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: And when I was watching J.D.’s speech, that’s the first thing that came to my mind, you know, it’s like a football team playing sort of pre-event defense, right. It’s like -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: -- just don’t do something that might screw you up because we’re winning this thing. All we have to do is just let the conversation be about Biden. We don’t have to, you know, push any buttons. I mean, J.D.’s pick itself was not really an effort to expand the coalition. Claire McCaskill: No, not at all. Sam Stein: Right. So like, just keep doing what you’re doing. If you don’t make any major screw ups, you’ll be okay. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. I actually think that J.D. Vance was picked because it was the only person that Trump saw the kind of ability to do the rhetorical flamethrowing that has been the essence of his appeal to voters. His willingness to say out loud things that a typical presidential candidate would never say out loud is really what catapulted him into the initial nomination. And I think he sees that capability in J.D. Vance and all the rest of it, even though, you know, he hates the facial hair and probably is not really thrilled about the fact that he is married to the daughter of an immigrant, even though he happens to be married to the daughter of an immigrant. It really is interesting to me that this is more about him finding a personality that he thinks can eventually carry the personality driven nature of the new, not Republican party, but Trump party. Sam Stein: Right. And there’s also the grievance politics -- Claire McCaskill: Yes. Sam Stein: -- the anti-immigration politics. Claire McCaskill: The anger, the total anger. Sam Stein: Yes. Claire McCaskill: I mean, J.D. Vance is just a pissed off guy. Sam Stein: Yeah. He wasn’t always this way. I mean, this changed, obviously -- Claire McCaskill: No. Oh, no. Sam Stein: Yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, no. Sam Stein: And Vance also is really close with Trump’s kids. I mean, he’s gotten really tight with Don, Jr. He’s kind of come up in this new conservative media ecosystem. He’s not a Fox News person. He’s more of like a Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA person. I don’t know if that makes sense, but this is the other thing that was really striking about it, and I’ll bring it back to Vance here, is that the vestiges of the Republican party were evident. Like Fox News was not really the main media channel for this week, and it was a bunch of different influencers. You didn’t have George W. Bush. You didn’t have Dick Cheney. You didn’t have Paul Ryan. You didn’t have Mike Pence. They say it’s unity here, but it’s not. It’s been a purge. Claire McCaskill: Totally. Sam Stein: And Trump has remade this party. And in that context, the Vance pick makes a lot of sense. He’s not really like a classic Republican. He’s part of this new breed of Republicans who’ve been, in this case, opportunistically aligned himself with, but who have been influenced by Trump and Trump’s politics. And he doesn’t really wreak of establishment favor. And I think Trump was drawn to that. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Doug Burgum is definitely more of an establishment figure than J.D. Vance. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, it’s fascinating to me, and this is something that we maybe even ought to spend some time on in a future episode, but Peter Thiel. I think it’s really important for people to understand the invisible hand of Peter Thiel in this convention and in this man that is running to be president of the United States. I mean, Peter Thiel was really the first of now many bro brothers, tech billionaires that got on board with Trump. I mean, he actually spoke at the convention, I think, in ‘16 or -- Sam Stein: Yes, in ‘16. Claire McCaskill: -- I think he spoke in ‘16, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: Yes, he did. Claire McCaskill: And J.D. Vance is a creature. No, I should say it this way. J.D. Vance was created by Peter Thiel. Jennifer Palmieri: In his current incarnation. Claire McCaskill: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: After “Hillbilly Elegy” on, it’s been all Peter Thiel. Every job he’s had, every office he’s won, he was 100 percent got into the Senate because of Peter Thiel. He got Trump’s endorsement because of Peter Thiel. You know, look at Hulk Hogan. That’s a Peter Thiel guy. He funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker. Peter Thiel is everywhere in this. And, you know, for a party that wants to talk about populism, to have a billionaire behind the curtain pulling the levers of power like this is stunning to me. And there needs to be more exposure about Peter Thiel. People need to understand this guy has really got some juice. Sam Stein: Yeah. To your point, there’s also the tech bro culture that’s coming around to Trump. I mean, David Sacks. Like who knew -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- who David Sacks was six months ago? He got a speaking gig from the floor and yet they didn’t have like Mitt Romney or George Bush there, but David Sacks. And then, of course, what happened over the weekend was Elon Musk coming out and fully endorsing Trump and then reports emerging that he’s going to give $45 million a month to a super PAC supporting Trump. That’s real money, right? Like, so what does that mean for policy? What does that mean for the future of the country? We have not really fully comprehended what comes with that cash, basically. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and Marc Andreessen. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, you know, people don’t know these names, but if you were from Silicon Valley and you understand where a lot of the money is in Silicon Valley, I mean, you can look around, whether it’s PayPal or Palantir or Facebook or, you know, any of the big names in tech, the big money, a lot of it now is totally on Trump. And it is fascinating to me. Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, not all of it. Not like, you know, like Apple and LinkedIn and, you know, Google and like -- Claire McCaskill: No, but you’re talking about a lot. Jennifer Palmieri: -- but like a lot. It’s the bro-y side. It’s the disruptors, the people like the Bitcoin people, the crypto people. It’s that crowd that like, you know, the Musk’s, those people. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: Right. But they see in Trump also kind of like, and this is such a classic 2016 trope, because this is what happened in 2016. They see in Trump kind of this empty vessel into which they can push their agenda. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: And we know this because they had Trump on that podcast that they all do. And then I think it was like a couple of days later, he comes out and he’s like, I’m fine with, you know, certain types of visas for immigrants because I talk to these guys and that’s what they want. Jennifer Palmieri: And he changed his position on crypto. Sam Stein: Exactly. And for them, you know, what a wonderful investment, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, right. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, right. Why not? Sam Stein: You get to have the potential president. And frankly, you know, you watch Trump and he’s more likely than not to win. You hedge your bets, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Yeah. Sam Stein: You say, okay, maybe two years ago, they probably wouldn’t have done this because it was uncertain if Trump could win and they would have been socially cascaded and also been politically problematic to them. But now you can get your foot in the door. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: Okay. So let’s turn. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Go, Jen. It’s time for him to weigh in on what’s going to happen. Jennifer Palmieri: I’m going to use a listener question to do this. Sam Stein: Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Michelle, her question was just wondering if the concerns are more about Joe Biden not being able to win by a big enough margin than him not winning at all. I could see the logic being, quote, “We have to win big to rebuild trust in the elections,” end quote. So I think probably what’s embedded in Michelle’s question is like confusion that, you know, people are hearing Democrats, you know, very senior Democrats in the party thinking that Biden really needs to drop out and seeming that it’s likely that he will, or at least possible that he will, I should say. Sam Stein: Your feelings changed by the hour. Jennifer Palmieri: I’m just so wrecked by this whole like drama from the last three weeks because there’s sort of this dichotomy of like people who all they want to do is beat Trump and win the house and win the Senate thinking that he can’t win and then seeing polls that show, you know, the like percentile, like, oh, Biden’s got a 53% chance of winning. I think people are not saying like, I don’t understand why they’re so eager to push Biden out the door if the polls that I’m seeing in the public domain show that the race is still really close. And then what you think is going to happen? I mean -- Sam Stein: Well, let’s just set the stage for when we’re talking because it’s so dynamic that, you know, it could be outdated -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- in like 20 minutes. We’re sitting here Friday. It’s like 9:40 a.m., okay. I’m watching as I’m recording this, that Jen O’Malley Dillon’s on “Morning Joe” and she’s giving a forceful case that he’s not going anywhere. I mean, she has to give that case because as soon as you say, well, he’s open to it, then it’s done. But anyways, let’s put that aside. It’s been a very weird experience here in Milwaukee because obviously everyone’s following what’s happening on the Republican side. There’s a whole convention going on in the city. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: But to a person, every journalist here is riveted by what’s happening on the Democratic side. And half of the reporters here are actually here in Milwaukee reporting on Democratic politics and I’m among them. I’ve been spending the last three days just calling people in the party. And look, to a person, people are freaked out. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: They think that this is not going to end well. They think there’s different degrees of not ending well, right? Like most people I talk to in high ranks and Democratic circles think Biden will likely lose. They don’t think it’s a certainty that he will lose, but it’s like fairly certain. Jennifer Palmieri: And explain why they think that because of the, the internal polling in the battleground states -- Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: -- because I think that we don’t get to this level of discussion on cable, frankly. Sam Stein: Right. So there’s a two reasons, right? Like, so you see these national polls, you’re like, oh, well, he’s got a fighter’s chance. You see these FiveThirtyEight models. You’re like, well -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: -- that’s really interesting. He’s actually favored. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: And then you have to step back and say, okay, the national polls are pretty relevant. We don’t choose presidents by a national popular vote. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: The FiveThirtyEight model takes into account things like historical incumbency advantages and macroeconomic conditions, which, fine, great. Like that’s helpful, but it’s not going to be determinative. Professor Alan Lichtman, who I’ve seen a lot thrown around -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- like he’s got 13 principles for the presidency and yet they’ve lined up most of the time, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be tried and true. So the real sort of bread and butter that I come back to are two things. One is state polls. They’re bad. They’re just bad for Biden -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- and they’ve gotten worse. And I think people need to understand when you’re talking about like three degree, three percentage points worse in state polls, that’s not nothing. That’s a lot, especially in a polarized country. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. That’s why Hillary lost. With three percentage points in polls across the board, like everything dropped by three points. Sam Stein: And so if you started pre-debate already slightly down and you’re now three percentage points, even more down, it just means you have to make up more ground. And here’s where number two comes in, which is there would be more confidence that he could make up ground if not for the fact that the debate was a disaster. And since then, he’s had decent episodes, but he’s also had bad episodes. Jennifer Palmieri: He’s had some bad episodes. Sam Stein: Yeah. And if you’re playing with a hand, that’s not great. The question is, do you change your hand? And so when everyone’s like, well, you know, the vice president doesn’t pull that much better. True. But she’s also got more tools and toolkit. And secondarily, this is what I’m hearing a lot more of is the psychic relief that you would get throughout the party in having that change, having a more deft candidate at the top of the ticket. And then being also able to say this argument about, you know, old candidates who are feeble and can’t handle the job. Like, we can now win this argument. I mean, look at Trump’s speech last night. Like, why can’t we have someone who’s like, actually, no-- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- we’ve made the tough choices. We have a younger candidate who’s generationally more attuned to modern America, and it’s their side that has the candidate who is meandering and out of touch and just gave an hour and a half speech on the convention that made no sense at times. And like, yeah, that’s the case for making the switch. I can also understand the case for not making the switch, but I think it’s less compelling. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And I do think people, you know, the emotional narrative, even if you are 100% in favor of Biden staying at the top of the ticket, you are holding your breath. And what our party has this cycle that we’ve not had in previous cycles is we have Donald Trump on the other side. And I truly believe that if Biden does step down, I truly believe that the emotional relief that people who hate Donald Trump will feel about having a candidate they’re more confident of, even if they are still angry that Biden’s not there, I actually believe that, assuming it’s Kamala Harris, which it should be, would come out of the convention ahead, and I think she’d stay there. Sam Stein: And not only that. I’ve been talking to donors and operatives who work with donors. Biden’s money troubles are about to be very pronounced. Claire McCaskill: Done. Done. Sam Stein: I mean, there are some serious problems there. Conversely, they say if, you know, they made a switch and it was Harris and I’m with you, Claire -- Claire McCaskill: It’s going to rain. Sam Stein: -- the amount of cash that would come in in those first three days would be astronomical. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: And not that cash is everything, but it matters a lot. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: It really does. And look, the party’s in a really tough spot. None of us have experienced anything like this. Jennifer Palmieri: None. Claire McCaskill: No. Sam Stein: And you wake up, I don’t know if this is for you, but I wake up, I’m like, Biden’s going to stick it out. And every night I go to bed, I’m like, there’s no way he’s going to stick it out. Claire McCaskill: I know. Jennifer Palmieri: Well, or whatever it is every day, I mean, it’s been humbling for certain, you know, to like not make predictions, to not, you know -- Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- understand like we’re living in unprecedented times -- Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- and like you can’t know and it’s up to one person and it’s a very tough call. Sam Stein: That convention will be truly interesting. I’m -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- somewhat excited for it. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. That will matter. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I was dreading going and now I’m, you know -- Sam Stein: No, no, no. You got to go. Claire McCaskill: I’m excited. Jennifer Palmieri: I wasn’t going to go. Now I’m going to go. Sam Stein: Hell yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. All right. Well, listen, you’re the best, Sam. We are grateful for you to come and hang out with us for a while. Hopefully you can get a chance -- Sam Stein: Anytime. Invite me back. Please. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, no, we will for sure.

Will the Supreme Court justices save Sen. Bob Menendez after his corruption verdict?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/bob-menendez-verdict-supreme-court-corruption-rcna162743,"After he was found guilty on all counts in his federal corruption trial this week, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., expressed confidence that he’ll be vindicated on appeal. At first blush, it’s tempting to cast his stated optimism as wishful thinking from someone fighting for his political and legal future. But the Supreme Court’s decisions siding with defendants in past political corruption cases render Menendez’s legal fate an open question. While the precise appellate issues in his case will take shape once his appeal gets underway, consider some of the high court’s recent decisions in other cases. Just this term, the Republican-appointed majority curbed use of federal bribery law against state and local officials, over dissent that argued the majority was dishonoring congressional intent to punish public corruption. This term’s breakdown aside, siding with defendants in these cases has been a bipartisan effort from the justices. Last year, the court unanimously threw out fraud convictions from New York. In 2020, Justice Elena Kagan wrote the unanimous ruling doing the same for convictions stemming from the Bridgegate scandal. Likewise, the court unanimously narrowed federal corruption prosecutions in its 2016 decision siding with former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. Against that backdrop, Menendez may have reason to hope that he becomes one of the next politicians to benefit from this line of jurisprudence. But an equally notable aspect of his guilty verdicts — for bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent and other crimes — is that the government secured them in spite of the high bar for federal prosecutors set by the Supreme Court over the years. So this may present a political corruption conviction that even the justices let stand. But it could be years before we know the answer.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warns anti-Biden Democrats about what comes next if they succeed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/aoc-biden-nomination-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-rcna162761,"UPDATE: (July 22, 2024, 7:36 a.m. ET): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced he's withdrawing from the 2024 race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Later Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pledged her ""full support"" for Harris. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has issued a dire warning to her party about the chaos that could ensue if they succeed in pushing President Joe Biden off the ticket. And she criticized Democrats who’ve given off-the-record quotes that suggest the party has resigned itself to a second Trump term.  In an Instagram Live video on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez warned liberals that a brokered convention could lead to chaos, in part because she says some of the Democratic “elites” who want Biden out also don’t want Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee in his place.  “If you think that is going to be an easy transition, I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class and these elites who are pushing for the president not to be the nominee also do not want to see the VP be the nominee,” she said.  Ocasio-Cortez claimed none of the people she’s spoken with who are calling on Biden to drop out — including lawmakers and legal experts — have articulated a plan to swap out the nominee without minimizing the serious legal and procedural challenges that are likely to ensue.  Ocasio-Cortez also highlighted the racial, ethnic and class divisions that appear to have formed between the majority of those pining to blow up the ticket — led mostly by white Democrats and media pundits — and those elected officials who feel they and their constituents have too much at stake to upend the process at this point and so are willing to do the work to re-elect Biden-Harris. She alluded to this cultural divide in her video when she spoke out against anonymous sources expressing a sense of fatalism on behalf of Democrats about what might happen if Biden remains on the ticket:  The important context here is that Ocasio-Cortez represents a majority-minority district, where a large number of her constituents are foreign-born. Earlier this week, I noted similar criticism voiced in a letter from the voter advocacy group Black Voters Matter that denounced some Democrats’ haphazard effort to overrule primary voters, oust Biden and potentially leapfrog Harris as the obvious second-in-line to be the party’s nominee. Part of that criticism stemmed from the fact that mobilizing Biden-Harris voters to cast a ballot for an entirely new set of nominees would most likely prove difficult. And the criticism didn’t end there. In fact, hours before Ocasio-Cortez's post to Instagram on Thursday, more than 1,400 Black women who are activists signed a separate letter calling out Democrats who are seeking to push Biden out and install someone other than Harris atop the ticket.  Democrats ought to heed these warnings and cease their hasty effort to oust Biden (or, failing that, to push aside Harris in the process) at the risk of fomenting resentment among voting blocs that are essential to their electoral goals.

Ben Sasse resigns as University of Florida president after wife's epilepsy diagnosis,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ben-sasse-resign-university-florida-president-wife-rcna162745,"Ben Sasse, a former Republican senator who represented Nebraska for eight years, said he will resign as University of Florida president at the end of this month to spend more time with his wife, who has been struggling with medical issues. “In recent months, Melissa has been diagnosed with epilepsy and has been struggling with a new batch of memory issues,” he said Thursday in a statement. “It’s been hard, but we’ve faced it together.” Sasse was appointed president in November 2022 and took office in February 2023. The university said its board of trustees will announce an interim president and start the search for a new president. Sasse detailed his wife’s recovery from past medical conditions, including an aneurysm and series of strokes in 2007, calling her “the strongest person I know” and a “warrior.” But, he said in his statement, her recent diagnosis has led to “a lot of late nights, a lot of hard decisions, and a lotta ‘what matters most?’ conversations.” Sasse, 52, said that his duties to his family and the university “are significantly at odds with each other right now.” “Gator Nation needs a president who can keep charging hard, Melissa deserves a husband who can pull his weight, and my kids need a dad who can be home many more nights,” he said. The couple has three children, two college-aged and one turning 13, Sasse said in his statement. He was in the Senate from 2015 to 2023. As a senator, Sasse reliably sided with Trump-backed bills, but he was a vocal critic of the former president, whom he once called “needy and desperate.” He was one of seven Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump in the Senate over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Sasse’s appointment at UF was not without controversy. His opposition to same-sex marriage in 2015 came under scrutiny, and critics said the selection process was not transparent enough. Yet he couldn’t stay away from politics as university president. In September, The New York Times reported on Sasse serving as a ""combatant"" in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' war on public education. In March, the university ended all positions focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as DEI-related contracts."
A chilling pattern at the RNC reveals what the Republican party has become,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 12:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-disturbing-anti-immigration-rhetoric-rcna162637,"In his rambling acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee Thursday night, former President Donald Trump unsurprisingly doubled down on anti-immigrant messaging, saying things like: “You know who’s taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens.” But throughout the four-day convention, a distinct and disturbing pattern emerged when it came to discussing immigration onstage: First, there’d be someone using violent rhetoric against migrants; then there’d emerge a Latino or Latina Republican to give the party cover. Take, for example, former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro, who spoke at the convention hours after being released Wednesday from a Miami federal prison, where he served a sentence for contempt of Congress. “Joe and Kamala, they threw out the woke blue carpet across the Rio Grande, opened our borders, to what? Murderers and rapists,” Navarro said, adding that when Trump called Mexicans “rapists” in 2015, he was viewed as racist. “We read the papers,” Navarro said. “It’s murderers and rapists. Drug cartels. Human traffickers. Terrorists. Chinese spies. And a whole army of illiterate illegal aliens stealing the jobs of Black, brown and blue-collar Americans.” At the RNC, facts were damned. Despite what Navarro and others said, there is no “migrant crime surge.” But according to Trump and Republicans, migrants are the country’s greatest security threat. Right after Navarro spoke, Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, took the stage. The juxtaposition was clear. A Latina Republican was there to give permission to the audience — both in the arena and watching from afar — to accept and validate what Navarro had just said. “I am the proud granddaughter of Mexican farmworkers, who came here with little more than faith in God,” De La Cruz began her remarks. “They never had much money, but they instilled in us strong Texas values. They taught me that through hard work, anything is possible in America.” “I’m living proof that the American Dream, el sueño americano, can become reality,” De La Cruz added. Later, she claimed that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “say their immigration policies are compassionate, but there is nothing compassionate about open borders. They threaten our national security and flood our country with deadly drugs, killing our precious children. Biden and Harris don’t care about immigrants, They just use them for political gain.” After Trump was shot Saturday, just two days before the start of the convention, Republicans promised to tone down their violent rhetoric. But clearly an exception was made for migrants, the vast majority of whom come from Latin American countries. As Navarro spoke, for example, convention attendees were waving “Mass Deportation Now!” signs.   This is what the Republican Party has become in 2024: Rattle the cage with fears of “invasions,” while positioning enough Latinos on stage to say there is nothing to see here. But the anti-immigrant agenda is blatant. See the first two items in the preamble of the official 2024 RNC program: “SEAL THE BORDER AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION” and “CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.” It should scare us all. The prospect of millions of people being rounded up and forcefully deported would be yet another dark stain on American history, just like slavery, the Trail of Tears, Japanese internment camps or the “Operation Wetback” efforts of the 1950s. A mass deportation plan would be a logistical nightmare and incredibly expensive, too. But this has not and will not detract Republicans, who appear more united on the call to “Send them back!” than on toning down the violent immigration rhetoric. It certainly has not inspired work on a realistic fix to this country’s failed bipartisan plans to finally achieve comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans worked hard during the convention to divide Latinos between those who came into this country “the right way” and those who didn’t. The Trump camp emphasized that theme last year during a controversial Univision interview, an emphasis that proves the “Latino Americans for Trump” rebrand outreach was more than just a change of semantics. Linda Fornos, who said she came to Nevada from Nicaragua 60 years ago and regrets voting for Biden in 2020, proclaimed from the RNC stage that “it’s upsetting to see millions of dollars being sent to help immigrants who came here illegally, while hard-working families who did it the right way are left struggling.” Peruvian American Vanessa Faura said that living under a Biden-Harris administration “feels more and more like I’m back in Latin America.” Faura left Peru when she was 9 years old.  Colombian American Bernie Moreno, the Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio, made sure he started his remarks by saying, “Many years ago, my parents brought me and my siblings to America legally.” In the eyes of Trump supporters, migrants lack humanity and are “poisoning the blood of our country.” A goal of the convention was to convince us that there are enough Republican allies from Latino communities who agree that mass deportation is the only solution and favor reducing immigration. This week, the White House posted on X that unlawful border crossings “dropped more than 50%.” Biden’s historic announcement to provide a legal pathway to undocumented spouses of American citizens will become reality on Aug. 19, days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His Covid diagnosis didn’t allow him to promote this game-changing policy at the UnidosUS conference this week, but the DNC has a massive opportunity to present a more accurate picture of what immigrants have done to benefit the United States. They have a duty to put a face to these individuals, who are big drivers in saving the country’s economy and reducing inflation. That narrative will provide a necessary counter to what was a week of straight-up migrant bashing from Republicans. "
