JD Vance’s ‘populism’ comes with some Trump-written fine print,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-populism-2024-trump-election-fine-print-rcna162409,"On the first night of the Republican National Convention, the party focused on “Making America Wealthy Again,” despite the fact that the United States has the strongest economy on the planet and is currently “the envy of the world.” On the second night, Republicans emphasized a “law and order” message, despite the fact that the party has nominated a criminal to lead its presidential ticket. On the third night of the gathering in Milwaukee, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee tried to sell voters on the idea that the party is prepared to shift its focus away from the wealthy elite as Donald Trump pitches tax breaks for billionaires at his glorified country club. Perhaps the “Make America Great Again” theme should be replaced with “Impose Cognitive Dissonance on America Again.” Voters unfamiliar with Sen. JD Vance might’ve tuned in to his convention speech, if for no other reason than to see and hear what the Ohio Republican had to say as he introduced himself to a national audience. His remarks were notable for a variety of reasons, though it was his economic vision that stood out. From the transcript of his remarks: The senator added soon after that he sees Trump as “America’s last best hope” for the nation’s working class. Vance went on to say, “We need a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business.” For viewers who didn’t know better, Vance’s rhetoric might very well have sounded like a refreshing break from party orthodoxy. It’s not exactly a secret that the Republican Party has championed the interests of the wealthy and corporate America for generations, so Vance’s version of “populism” appeared to represent an important shift. There was, however, a rather dramatic problem hanging overhead: Trump’s record and future plans. Indeed, literally one day before Vance boasted about Republicans no longer “catering to Wall Street,” the GOP’s presumptive presidential nominee boasted about his eagerness to slash the corporate tax rate in a prospective second term. The same day, The New York Times published a striking report on the degree to which Trump’s plans for trade tariffs would “widen the gap between the rich and the poor” and hit “lower-income households” the hardest. This is the same Trump who not only rewarded the wealthy and big businesses with massive tax giveaways in his first term, but who also supports undoing Wall Street safeguards — which helps explain why billionaires are rallying behind his candidacy. As for Vance’s idea that the United States needs ""a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business,” the Washington Post recently reported on the former president recently huddling with Big Oil leaders at Mar-a-Lago. If the account is accurate, the Republicans’ presumptive presidential nominee told the oil industry executives that they should raise $1 billion to return him to the White House — and if they did, he’d reward them by eliminating environmental safeguards and approving new tax breaks. The “deal” that Trump described, the Post added, “stunned several of the executives in the room.” Soon after, three oil executives organized an event for Trump — attendees paid $250,000 per person to be there — where the Republican assured his wealthy supporters that he’d do everything the oil industry wants, including lifting the natural gas export ban, scrapping existing energy safeguards and opening up more federal lands to oil drilling. After Vance exited the convention stage, I was left with one question: Does he have any idea what his new boss intends to do after the election?"
The worst thing about Ted Cruz’s dystopian RNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speech-ted-cruz-immigration-border-control-rcna162400,"If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the last nine years, it’s that when reality proves inconvenient for MAGA, MAGA simply creates its own reality. This was certainly true of Tuesday’s “Make America Safe Once Again” night at the Republican National Convention, at which the speaker’s podium was the rhetorical equivalent of a wrench-opened fire hydrant, as one speaker after another recklessly sprayed lies, fear and demagoguery in every direction.  Sen. Ted Cruz’s undiluted rage was particularly dishonest, and because it was Ted Cruz, it was as awkward as it was angry. His clumsy attempt to coax the crowd into a refrain of “every damn day” — a reference to how often he claimed that “teenagers, girls and boys” are raped, murdered and “sold into a life of sex slavery” because of “our open border” — mostly fell flat.  There are, of course, some documented examples of horrific crimes committed by undocumented people, as there are with any demographic group that numbers in the millions. But on the whole, immigrants both legal and undocumented commit crimes (violent crimes, in particular) at rates lower — often much lower — than the native-born population.  The much-maligned “sanctuary cities” have lower crime rates than other cities. Cities that have been hospitable to migrants seeking asylum have seen less crime than other cities. Crime in most of those cities has dropped since they began receiving migrants from the most recent wave of immigration, including the cities where Republican governors have been shipping migrants.  If such gruesome crimes were really happening “every damn day,” you’d think Cruz, R-Texas, could find more a recent horror story than, for example, the death of Kate Steinle, who died, as Cruz put it, after a man who “had been deported five times” fired a bullet that “ripped through her heart.”  If that name sounds familiar, it’s because Donald Trump also mentioned Steinle in his acceptance speech at the 2016 RNC. Steinle died nine years ago, after a man named José Inez García Zárate found a gun wrapped in cloth under a bench on a pier in San Francisco.  It’s true that Zárate had been deported five times. He was also a felon, though for nonviolent drug crimes. The gun had been stolen from an agent with the Bureau of Land Management, who left it unsecured in his car. Zárate testified at his trial that the gun went off when he picked it up. Ballistics reports confirmed that the bullet ricocheted off a concrete block and struck and killed Steinle, who was 90 feet away. There is no evidence that he intentionally fired the gun, much less that he intended to kill Steinle. A jury acquitted him on all charges but one (being a felon in possession of a firearm), and that charge was later thrown out by a judge. He pleaded guilty to related federal charges in 2022 and was deported this year. Steinle’s family has repeatedly asked politicians to stop politicizing her death. For politicians like Cruz, a family’s grief is legitimate only when it can be harnessed to hoover up votes.  Cruz also claimed that “Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children,” reiterating the central claim of conspiracists who push the racist “great replacement theory.” There is, of course, no evidence that undocumented people vote in significant numbers, that there’s some coordinated campaign to get them to the polls or that voting plays any role in the Biden administration’s immigration policy. (There is also evidence that Biden has actually been tougher on illegal border crossers than Trump.)   House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., repeated Trump’s brazen lie about other countries’ “emptying prisons” by sending their felons to the U.S. (Trump often includes “mental institutions” in his claim). There’s no evidence this is true. Ironically, it’s a line first used by Fidel Castro to denigrate refugees fleeing his communist regime and that Republicans today often use to slander Venezuelan migrants fleeing the socialist government of Nicolás Maduro.  Several speakers also repeated the tired claim that fentanyl has been flowing through the border because of the Biden administration’s lax enforcement.  According to data compiled by Dan Bier of the Cato Institute, just 2 of every 10,000 people caught trying to enter the country illegally possess any fentanyl at all. Over 90% of fentanyl seizures come at legal points of entry, and 86% of people convicted of smuggling the drug are U.S. citizens. Moreover, smuggling of fentanyl, which is easier to conceal and far more concentrated than other illicit drugs, actually increased during the Covid travel restrictions. The idea that Biden has been lax on border enforcement will come as a surprise to the immigrant advocates who are furious with him.   There’s also zero evidence that terrorists are traipsing across the southern border, as several speakers claimed. There has yet to be a single documented case of an American citizen killed or injured by a terrorist who illegally crossed the southern border, and since 1975 there have been only nine documented cases of anyone ultimately being convicted of terrorism after illegally entering the country.  Beyond immigration, speaker after speaker attempted to terrify viewers into the voting booth with claims about crime that have been disproven over and over again. We heard much about “Soros-funded” prosecutors’ unleashing a wave of crime and violence on America’s cities. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lamented that these prosecutors “care more about coddling criminals than protecting their own communities” and that they “impose their will on us without our consent.”  This is a particularly rich accusation to come from DeSantis, who removed two prosecutors overwhelmingly elected (and re-elected) by their constituents and replaced them with the very sort of law-and-order prosecutors those voters had rejected. Though DeSantis accused the prosecutors of being “soft on crime,” there’s little evidence that crime has been higher in their districts than in similar districts around the state. There’s also no evidence that progressive or reformist prosecution policies more broadly correlate with an increase in violent crime.  Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde claimed the Biden administration has “made us less safe at home with their ‘defund the police’ movement.”   That statement may be the most impressive lie-to-word-count ratio yet.  Biden didn’t support the “defund” movement; he was openly critical of it. The Biden administration hasn’t cut federal funding to law enforcement; it has increased it (sometimes over the objections of Republicans). In the two years after the George Floyd protests, 8 in 10 departments’ funding increased at least 2%. A handful of departments saw marginal cuts in funding, but no police department was “defunded.” There’s also zero evidence that more police funding corresponds with a reduction in crime or that less funding corresponds with an increase. (Otherwise, Hovde’s claim is accurate!)  Finally, here’s some context you didn’t hear: When Trump took office in 2017, he inherited the lowest murder rate of any president in half a century. He was then the first president in three decades to finish his term with a higher murder rate than when he started. Trump isn’t to blame for all of that. He presided over a once-in-a-generation pandemic that disrupted black markets, took witnesses off the streets and brought a wave of desperation and despair. His term also included the largest civil rights protests in U.S. history, which only reinforced the (understandable) antipathy toward police in many marginalized communities.  For the most part, presidents and their policies have little effect on crime. But there is some research suggesting that crime tends to go up when people see the government as corrupt, incompetent or hostile to their interests, particularly among marginalized groups. The theory here is that when people lose faith in government, they’re less likely to cooperate with state institutions like police and the courts. And it seems safe to say that from 2017 to 2021 there was ample reason to see the government as corrupt, incompetent and discriminatory. Immigrants, in particular, were less likely to report crimes and cooperate with police during the Trump years, most likely out of fear that they or their families would be subjected to immigration investigations.  All of that having been said, most of what drove the surge in crime was beyond Trump’s control. But this isn’t a courtesy Trump has given his opponents.  Back in 2016, Trump and his surrogates blamed Barack Obama for a surge in crime that never happened. They’re now doing the same thing to Biden. So it only seems fair to point out that the only major surge in crime in 40 years occurred while Trump was in the White House.   There is at least one class of crimes that has increased exponentially since Biden took office: crimes committed by former presidents. But that probably isn’t a trend the RNC wants to emphasize. "

Alleged neo-Nazi is accused of plotting mass attack in New York,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 4:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/new-york-city-attack-white-supremacist-plot-rcna162424,"A federal grand jury in New York City has handed down an indictment charging an alleged neo-Nazi leader with plotting a deadly attack on Jews and racial minorities. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that a 21-year-old Georgian national named Michail Chkhikvishvili had allegedly tried to recruit people to commit hate crimes and a mass casualty attack in Brooklyn. Authorities say he was known as “Commander Butcher” and led a white supremacist group called the Maniac Murder Cult. He was arrested in Moldova on July 6, officials said. According to a news release from the Justice Department: Authorities allege that Chkhikvishvili gave the undercover agent tips about how to carry out an attack: One of the schemes Chkhikvishvili is accused of plotting involved having someone dress up as Santa Claus and give out poison-laced candy to racial minorities and children at Jewish schools in Brooklyn. (Chkhikvishvili had no defense lawyer listed in online court records, NBC News reported.) By my count, this is the second federal indictment in a little over a month involving allegations of a foiled mass murder plot fueled by racist hate. In June, the Justice Department accused an Arizona man of plotting to spark a race war with a mass shooting at a rap concert in Atlanta. Combined with a resurgence of racist hate speech on X and other social media platforms — along with neo-Nazis comfortably marching through city streets, as we’ve seen in Nashville recently — these indictments point toward a spike in unabashed racism. And they underscore a fact highlighted by officials from both Donald Trump’s administration and Joe Biden’s: White supremacists remain a top domestic threat to Americans."
I've led battleground Republicans to victory. 'MAGA baggage' will cost them in 2024.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-maga-battleground-republicans-2024-rcna162362,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC’s special coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention on July 16. Republican Senate candidates took center stage on the second day of the 2024 Republican National Convention, including two notable and familiar faces: failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and Pennsylvania’s Dave McCormick. Both Lake and McCormick’s races will be critical as Republicans and Democrats battle for control of the Senate this November. Let’s start with McCormick’s bid against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania. I remember Casey’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate. I was working very hard with the Republican Party to defeat him — we were ultimately unsuccessful. At that time, I recognized some of the dynamics Casey brought to the table that made him a successful swing state candidate. He appealed not just to the more liberal parts of the state — southwestern Pennsylvania or Philadelphia — but also to the more traditionally conservative or center-right portions. Casey was and still is, in many respects, a quintessential Pennsylvanian candidate who has across-the-board appeal to voters. The same can’t be said for McCormick, who comes into November’s election with a serious handicap: the Republican Party’s MAGA baggage. The lies of the MAGA agenda are dissected a lot cleaner and a lot easier in statewide races where the margins are tighter. Now, if you’re Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or any Republican running in a heavily red district, that’s not something you necessarily have to worry about. But for McCormick in Pennsylvania and Lake in Arizona that should be top of mind.  As for Lake, she spent her time onstage Tuesday lying about a number of topics, including that her Democratic opponent in Arizona, Rep. Ruben Gallego, wants to let “millions” of undocumented immigrants vote in the upcoming election. Those lies, which are a key part of the MAGA playbook under Donald Trump, will catch up to her in November.  As long as Democrats quickly put the concerns over President Joe Biden’s candidacy behind them, they’re in a much stronger position this election cycle. There’s no Biden baggage on policy; Democrats don’t have to lie to voters. They can talk about abortion, they can lean into the Supreme Court, and they can run on the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS Act.  That ability to have that clear and concise narrative is essential for victory at the ballot box. It’s how I helped the Republican Party win in 2010. Under my leadership as Republican National Committee chairman, the GOP scored huge wins in the House and the Senate. Those victories didn’t come because we focused on battleground states alone. We had to create momentum elsewhere that boiled back into those battleground races. With the MAGA baggage weighing the Republican Party down, that task will be much harder today.  Join Michael Steele, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7 in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its kind live event. You’ll get to see your favorite hosts in person, and hear thought-provoking conversations about what matters most in the final weeks of an unprecedented election cycle. Buy tickets here."
Matt Gaetz and Kevin McCarthy’s feud flares up at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 2:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/matt-gaetz-kevin-mccarthy-republican-national-convention-rcna162365,"The feud between Rep. Matt Gaetz and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy flared up yet again when the two men had a brief, tense encounter on the floor of the Republican National Convention. Footage of the Tuesday incident shows Gaetz approaching McCarthy, who is mid-conversation, and taunting him. “What night are you speaking? Are you speaking tonight, or ... ?” Gaetz asks as someone pushes him away. He then goes up to the California Republican again, saying: “If you took that stage, you would get booed off of it.” As Gaetz walks away, someone tells him to “shut up.” Gaetz’s instigation of McCarthy in such a public venue is not out of character for the 42-year-old Florida Republican, who is prone to trolling tactics. It also underscores the bad blood between the two, which previously resulted in McCarthy’s ousting as House speaker and weeks of disarray among the House GOP. And the feud shows no signs of ending. When asked about the incident later in the day, McCarthy suggested that Gaetz was upset that McCarthy had not halted a congressional ethics investigation into allegations that Gaetz paid a 17-year-old to have sex with him. (Gaetz has vehemently denied the allegation and any wrongdoing.) McCarthy told NBC News: “Well, it’s all about he had an ethics complaint four years ago that he paid an underage girl. ... And he came to me to try to leverage me to stop the ethics investigation. That’s illegal — I’m not doing that.” Last year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against Gaetz in a sex trafficking probe. The House Ethics Committee announced last month that it was continuing to investigate several allegations against him. On Tuesday, Gaetz railed against the investigation in a post on X and appeared to blame McCarthy, who resigned from Congress in December 2023. “This is Soviet. Kevin McCarthy showed them the man, and they are now trying to find the crime,” Gaetz wrote. “I work for Northwest Floridians who won’t be swayed by this nonsense and McCarthy and his goons know it.” In his interview with NBC News, McCarthy also seemed to suggest that Gaetz should be in prison. “Look, everybody has different people in their party,” he said. “Unfortunately, Matt happens to be here. I think at the end of the day, he probably shouldn’t be on the streets.”"
Tucker Carlson decries 'weak men' unwilling to beat up school employees,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 2:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tucker-carlson-rnc-heritage-foundation-rcna162393,"Thus far, the Republican National Convention’s speakers have undermined some conservatives' claims that this year's event would focus on promoting national “unity.” Remarkably, though, some of the most disturbing speeches from right-wingers this week have come not from the main stage, but rather from a few blocks away at an event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, the group that coordinated the drafting of Project 2025, a far-right plan to increase Donald Trump's power and politicize federal agencies if he's elected in November. The Heritage Foundation's Policy Fest, an extremist-fueled speaker series keynoted by fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson, unfolded just down the street from Fiserv Forum, where the RNC is taking place. The physical distance seems to have been strategic. Trump has tried to publicly distance himself from Project 2025, though several of its authors were members of his administration. So perhaps some Republicans thought holding a Heritage Foundation event that’s ostensibly separate from the RNC would help the GOP’s effort to appear less radical.  But Monday proved that plenty of GOP power brokers are all in on Project 2025 and the politics that inspired it. Heritage Foundation CEO Kevin Roberts doubled down on Project 2025, calling it “a plan among a unified movement to speak on behalf of the everyday American, the forgotten American.” In reality, it reads more like a plan to remake the government under Christian nationalist and far-right ideals that include defining heterosexual marriage as “biblically based,” supercharging religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, withdrawing Food and Drug Administration approval of abortion medication and concentrating power in the presidency. Carlson boosted these alarming ideas in his Policy Fest speech on Monday, telling the crowd the recent shooting at a Trump rally proved there is a “spiritual battle” underway and claimed liberals are motivated by an “anti-human” force that seeks to “eliminate” Christians. Carlson later decried the abundance of “weak men” unwilling to commit violence against school employees. He falsely claimed schools are trying to ""indoctrinate"" kids and turn them into “circus freaks” before he fantasized about harming school employees.  “In the country that I grew up in, the dad would just punch the counselor out. You know, ‘Put me in jail, I don’t care,’” Carlson said, before baselessly suggesting school counselors are engaging in “child molester stuff.” He continued:  Policy Fest featured several other speakers well-known among the MAGA faithful, including failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Tom Homan, acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Trump administration. Homan, whom Trump has said he would tap for a job if he’s elected again, tried to downplay Trump’s authoritarian goals related to immigration. Although Trump has publicly refused to rule out building camps for mass detention as part of his campaign’s vow to establish the most massive deportation effort in history, Homan claimed — without evidence — that a Trump immigration policy wouldn’t include any of the things reported in the media.  “People say, 'Trump’s threatening this historic deportation operation. He’s going to build concentration camps. He’s going to sweep neighborhoods,'"" Homan said. ""Let me be clear. None of that will happen."" He went on to issue a warning that seemed to apply not only to newly arriving immigrants but also to recipients of protections offered under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, too. “No one’s off the table,” he said. “If you’re in the country illegally, it’s not OK. If you’re in the country illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”"
Jon Stewart still has some soul-searching to do. His first RNC show proved it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 1:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-bill-oreilly-daily-show-interview-rnc-rcna162375,"Jon Stewart and “The Daily Show” on Tuesday executed what Deadline.com called a “Milwaukee pivot” — a programming change forced upon them by last weekend’s tragic violence in Butler, Pennsylvania. Originally, the idea was to air the popular fake news show live from the site of the Republican National Convention. The attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Stewart revealed, scuttled the plan. His Milwaukee venue was placed under lockdown. With “cages built around the theater,” Stewart and his team decided that it wouldn’t be prudent to perform live comedy “without,” the host deadpanned, “people.”  Taped on Tuesday, the episode was stuck rehashing RNC highlights from Monday. Stewart thus missed an opportunity to skewer the speeches of former Trump detractors Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio. Each performed variations, albeit less deserving of our enduring awe, of JD Vance’s ability to forget he once called his new boss “America’s Hitler” and “cultural heroin.” (Vance’s opioid analogy must be the most remarkable observation I’ve ever read about Trump).  Stewart also interviewed his longtime interlocutor, frenemy and sparring partner Bill O’Reilly, and quipped about the two of them being “somewhat fossilized practitioners of the rhetorical arts.” In relation to their past popularity and influence on this generation of political rabble-rousers, Stewart observed, “We made a pretty spectacular living pushing those envelopes.” This isn’t the first time Stewart has wondered aloud whether he is predator or prey (or peripheral) in the new social media ecosystem. In February he called himself “the captain of this dying medium.” He does seem to intuit that what worked artistically, and maybe even politically, in the Bush and Obama eras is perhaps outdated or irrelevant or actually not entirely helpful in this MAGA moment.  If Stewart is pondering that, then good on him. I guess the venue change, and the terror that prompted it, should compel him to pose hard questions about the intersection between art and politics. Questions like: What exactly are entertainers as influential as Jon Stewart supposed to be doing at a point in American history as troubling as this one? I’m starting to believe that Stewart and his team actually don’t know how to answer this question. No disgrace in that. I don’t either. The current moment is as baffling as it is frightening. Although, when your theater is caged in and your audience can’t attend for their own safety because yet another young white male tried to murder people with a perfectly legal killing machine — then, well, maybe it’s a good time to reflect.   Tuesday night’s program indicated that the usually self-aware Stewart is still thinking this through, and has not yet made any discernible pivot. His jokes about odd noises made by Marjorie Taylor Green were funny enough. The analysis of how Lee Greenwood refused to cede the stage while introducing Trump was fairly hysterical. Trump himself gestured that the long-winded singer-songwriter should move this along (“Is it possible to bring out another band to play a band off?” Stewart quipped). The Bill O’Reilly interview best encapsulated many of these contradictions that Stewart has to confront. These men, by my count, have interviewed each other some two dozen times over the years. They have excellent chemistry. They like each other. (Or, perhaps, they like to hate each other.) O’Reilly even recently attended Stewart’s show. The hard-charging conservative “newsman,” who was fired by Fox News in the wake of five sexual harassment suits (which he has denied), is sort of avuncular when conversing with Stewart. O’Reilly made reasonable points about rage and today’s politics. “We are now in a society,” he opined “where hatred is rewarded.” Stewart jumped in: “It’s incentivized, it’s monetized!” Dialogue. Consensus. I like it! One problem, though, is that the same O’Reilly who was bemoaning “the hate brigade” Tuesday night has been eminently hateful himself. I am not going to rehash his views on Trayvon Martin’s murder, on gay marriage, victim blaming, comparing the ACLU to terrorists, blatant and pervasive sexism, anti-LGBTQ and transgender rants, religious fearmongering (such as his yearly diatribe against the “war on Christmas”), or his discomforting white power vibes.  I am going to say that Jon Stewart has to figure something out. When he’s choppin’ it up with Bill O’Reilly is he: a) fostering open and honest discussion across the ideological divide, thereby enriching our liberal democracy? Or, b) platforming a voice that is both cause and effect of the lethal danger that is threatening the existence of liberal democracy itself? Because it sure as hell can’t be both.  When O’Reilly started reading off unflattering statistics about Biden’s economy, Stewart did push back, literally. He prompted his guest to explain how Biden is solely responsible for high food prices, gas prices, mortgage rates, etc., given what he inherited from his predecessor. When O’Reilly responded he didn’t know, Stewart guffawed, comically pushed back his own chair, got up and walked away.  An interesting gesture, that was. No one is asking Stewart to walk away from his comedic throne. But I’d hope the events of the past few months might stimulate deeper reflection on what artists are supposed to do in dark times."
A heartbreaking story at the RNC peddles a horribly misguided narrative,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 1:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speeches-push-dangerous-trump-narrative-biden-border-policy-rcna162374,"On the second night of the Republican National Convention, a woman named Anne Fundner shared a heartbreaking story. A few years ago, she and her husband and their four children were living in Southern California, she told the crowd. She painted an idyllic picture of their family life. Her 15-year-old son, Weston, played hockey and football and loved to surf. The family had barbecues on the beach. Then Weston, succumbing to peer pressure, got high with friends — and died of fentanyl poisoning. It’s an unspeakable tragedy, one felt by too many Americans in the relentless wave of an opioid epidemic that continues to claim more than 74,000 lives a year. Unfortunately, Fundner’s story of personal loss is being used to promote a dangerous and false narrative about the state of crime under the current administration. In her speech, Fundner had no doubt about who was to blame. It happened, she said, because President Joe Biden “opened our borders.” And the solution, according to her and many speakers present in Milwaukee Tuesday night, is to re-elect Donald Trump, who will close them again and, she urged, classify Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. When she said this, Trump apparently leaned over to his running mate JD Vance and mouthed, “We should do it.” Hour after hour, speakers hit the same themes. Biden had “opened the border.” Sen. Marco Rubio said when Trump was president “our border was secure and our laws were enforced” — but that those days are gone. Ben Carson said, “We have a wide open border.” Tom Cotton said, “Joe Biden thinks borders are racist.” The implication for all of them was that an open border is to blame for the country’s fentanyl crisis. This narrative of course is complete nonsense. That doesn’t mean that the pain of parents like Fundner isn’t all too real. I myself know it is, having someone I cared about die of a fentanyl overdose three years ago. But the problem has absolutely nothing do with Biden “opening our border” because no such event has occurred. The available statistics expose the RNC speeches about “open borders” as a dispatch from an alternate dimension. To start, the Department of Homeland Security’s total number of “encounters” with migrants (“encounters” is DHS speak for “arrests”) was far greater during Biden’s first two years in office than the corresponding years of the Trump administration. And greater percentage of those “encountered” under Biden have been deported than under Trump. In fact, immigrants’ rights groups are furious at Biden for reasons anyone who believed what they saw at the RNC would have found incomprehensible. Biden championed a bipartisan bill that would have shredded many of the rights of asylum-seekers. People who in some cases have reason to be terrified that they’ll be tortured or killed if they returned to their home countries, are going to have their cases heard faster, not because the existing system would be expanded to deal with the backlog but because their cases would be moved from the Department of Justice to the DHS, where they’d get “a much faster review, often without attorneys or a deliberative process,” according to reporting from PBS. When that bill failed, after most Republicans followed Trump’s lead in opposing it, Biden acted unilaterally by executive order to curtail the rights of many asylum-seekers. He’s now being sued by several immigrants’ rights groups as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, which notes: “These executive actions will effectively shut off any access to asylum protections for the vast majority of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, no matter how strong their claims. The proclamation echoes the Trump administration’s previous asylum entry ban, which immigrants’ rights advocates successfully challenged."" Ted Cruz said at the RNC that the influx of undocumented immigrants was an “invasion” — not, he clarified, a figurative invasion but a literal one. He named a number of Americans who were raped or killed by criminals who had entered the country illegally, claiming to “speak for” these individuals (it is unclear whether or not the individuals approved of Cruz and his politics). The best available data shows that the undocumented migrant population is far less likely to commit crimes (beyond the initial illegal entry) than native-born Americans, likely because they’re afraid of being deported. American citizens who are the victims of violence are, in the overwhelming majority of cases, victims of other American citizens. And while we’re at it, a crushingly overwhelming majority of those arrested for smuggling fentanyl —86% — are American citizens, and more than nine out of 10 fentanyl seizures “occur at legal crossing points or interior vehicle checkpoints, not on illegal migration routes.” This stands to reason, given U.S. citizens crossing legally are far less likely to be seized and searched. Fentanyl overdoses are aptly classed as “deaths of despair,” statistically concentrated in Rust Belt areas ravaged by deindustrialization. To actually tackle the fentanyl crisis, we’d need to start by devoting far more resources to treatment for addicts, but above all you’d need to do something about the despair, by moving toward a more economically equal society. That is likely the last thing Trump and JD Vance plan to do should they be elected in November. The first Trump administration was a four-year orgy of tax cuts for rich people, deregulation and union-busting. He even went after Medicaid expansion. If Trump returns to office and gives us four more years of these policies, the result will be a society mired even more deeply in poverty, inequality and mass despair than it is right now. And that’s a recipe for a whole lot more grieving mothers looking for someone to blame."
Real hillbillies like me don’t trust JD Vance. You shouldn’t trust him either.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-trump-vp-appalachia-rcna162105,"It’s easy to understand why “Hillbilly Elegy,” the 2016 memoir by JD Vance, piqued the interest of the American people. It recycles a narrative America has relied on for a century to sleep soundly despite the everyday horrors of our society: Rich people do well because they are morally better than the poor. Add some powerful tropes — a firebrand “pistol packing lunatic” mamaw who protects at all costs, a rags-to-riches story in which Vance, a Marine,  escapes the “worst of my cultural inheritance” (p. 253) of unsophisticated, drug-addicted, murderous hillbillies — and you’ve got a bestseller. You’ve also got a dangerous lie, one relying on ugly stereotypes that harm real Appalachians in order to advance a political career. Former President Donald Trump announced Monday that Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, is his pick for his running mate. Unlike me, Vance is not Appalachian.  He was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, well outside any maps of the distinct geographical and cultural region. Trump picking this Rust Belt charlatan as his running mate Monday sparked a resounding and unifying rant among conservative and liberal hillbillies alike in my social media feed: We do not acknowledge him. Why would we? Vance introduces his reader to Appalachia by immediately profiling the worst behaviors of each of his uncles, including a scene of grotesque violence. He calls us a “pessimistic bunch” living in a “hub of misery” (p. 4), and over and over again he uses a wide brush to paint Appalachians as lazy, ignorant and unwilling to try at life. Though there are dozens of offensive stories to choose from in “Hillbilly Elegy,” perhaps the most ridiculous one occurs when, during boot camp, Vance says he meets an eastern Kentuckian who, never having heard the term, asks “What’s a Catholic?” because, as Vance presents it, “down in that part of Kentucky [where he says that man is from], everybody’s a snake handler.” (p. 160). It’s an addictively stereotypical image: the ignorant, isolated, snake-handling hillbilly. But it’s not reality. There are a half dozen churches in that Kentuckian’s county seat, mostly Baptist and Methodist.  Just 20 miles away, in Hazard, there’s a Catholic Church. Another 20 miles away, where Vance’s family lives, there’s a Catholic Church with more than 4,000 Facebook followers. Vance’s memoir of Appalachia, full of gun-toting, drug-addicted “lunatics” aimlessly awaiting death, is at best a cherry-picking of the worst moments of his life. At worst, it’s a concoction of real memories and some of television’s worst stereotypes of what Appalachia is. I do not see my Appalachia in it. I am not alone. Anthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll’s “Appalachian Reckoning,” a response to Vance’s bestseller, anthologizes more than 400 pages of responses from real Appalachians describing their lives in all the nuance they deserve. But nuanced stories aren’t useful in politics. Appalachia is simply a rhetorical device for Vance that he used to launch a political career. If your political goal is to blame the poor for their own problems, then using the regional ethnicity of your grandparents to present yourself as “authentic” can compel readers to believe your narrative or to feel good about having already believed it. After all, the narrative of the lazy hillbilly has existed for as long as rich folks outside of Appalachia needed an explanation for mountain poverty that doesn’t include blaming themselves. Did the poverty come from the rest of the country ignoring a region they thought had no resources? Did the poverty come from coal barons stealing resources once they were discovered? Did the poverty come from outside coal companies not paying coal miners actual money for decades? Why blame complex issues that implicate rich white folks when “lazy” is only two syllables? Vance builds on this narrative, ignoring nuance and context, presenting supposed anecdote after supposed anecdote of cultural depravity and portraying himself as a hillbilly who survived and knows the answer to what ails Appalachia is political conservatism. For Vance, issues of poverty, drug abuse and neglected children are “issues of family, faith, and culture.” (p. 238) He goes so far as to claim that these “problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else.” (p. 255) That’s insulting. Individuals living in poverty did not invent opioids. Individuals living in poverty did not refuse to regulate opioids. He puts the blame entirely on poor Americans, on mothers on food stamps and on fathers who are out of work, extending the roots of that blame directly to Appalachians and some inherent moral flaw. In convincing readers outside of Appalachia that they need the solution he is selling, he paints the Appalachian as the moral problem in America: “If there is any temptation to judge these problems as the narrow concerns of backwoods hollers, a glimpse at my own life reveals that Jackson [Kentucky]’s plight has gone mainstream. Thanks to the massive migration from the poorer regions of Appalachia to places like Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, hillbilly values spread widely along with hillbilly people.” (p. 20) The dog whistle is pretty clear: The immoral hill folks are already in your area. Trust me, I escaped them. I know the answer to save you from them. The “hillbilly” twist is a particularly clever political move because it allows poor white folks living in swing states (like those listed above) to draw a quick line of demarcation around themselves — hardworking but poor Americans — and the supposed immoral, lazy welfare queens and absent, violent hillbilly fathers spreading into their cities and towns. Vance paints himself as having narrowly escaped  “the deep anger and resentment” (p. 2) of those who raised him and laments the supposed white working class feeling that “our choices don’t matter.” (p. 176) Wednesday morning, my sister, who has known overwhelming pain and difficulty, signed up for nursing classes at a community college. Last week, my nephew, a young man with everything stacked against him, asked me to meet him to talk about vocational school.   I see people making choices. I see no anger. Vance confuses frustration in a difficult system with anger and resentment; he misrepresents  Appalachians acknowledging that the choices they have are few and far between and require great levels of personal sacrifice as their belief that the choices they make don’t matter. He sees the drowning person and decides they lack determination in swimming. He ignores those creating the flood. Vance does identify one hillbilly trait that I will, at this moment, agree with: We can be distrustful of outsiders. I might add that I am most distrustful of outsiders pretending to be insiders and of outsiders with a political agenda.  This hillbilly does not trust JD Vance."
One of Biden's Supreme Court reform obstacles: the Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/joe-biden-supreme-court-reform-expansion-rcna162339,"President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse Supreme Court reforms like term limits and a binding ethics code for the justices. Generally speaking, it’s a positive development at a time when the Roberts Court is exerting outsized power over the other two, nominally coequal branches of government. But even if Congress (which is partly Republican controlled) were to pass such reforms, the Republican-majority Supreme Court could strike them down as unconstitutional. There’s debate over whether term limits require a constitutional amendment, and the court has resisted perceived intrusions on its operations. The court last year did adopt its own code of conduct, but that lacks an enforcement mechanism. That doesn’t mean that the court’s protective view of itself is correct, or that Democrats shouldn’t push for change in any event. But a Supreme Court that jealously guards its power imposes a practical reality on any efforts to curtail that power.     Perhaps counterintuitively, the most significant potential reform could be the least legally controversial: adding seats to the court to balance the 6-3 Republican supermajority. Legislation could accomplish that and wouldn't require a constitutional amendment. The court’s size has changed several times throughout its history. Yet, Biden doesn’t appear to be pushing for court expansion. But while the court itself would be unable to stop it on constitutional grounds, expanding the court would — like any other attempt to diminish the court’s power — have to get through Congress with its Republican-controlled House first.

"In speech to the NAACP, Biden says denouncing violence won’t stop his criticism of Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 11:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/biden-speech-naacp-trump-political-violence-rcna162353,"In his first campaign speech after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, President Joe Biden said the need for rejecting political violence doesn’t mean he’ll be shying away from denouncing the former president’s illiberal behavior or record. Conservatives have baselessly argued that the shooting in Pennsylvania was an outgrowth of liberals’ criticism of his authoritarian behavior. And Biden is pushing back on that bogus claim. Addressing Black voters and lawmakers during a speech to the NAACP in Nevada, the president reiterated his call for everyone to reject political violence. But he received applause after he name-checked Black people who have been the victims of violence and violent threats in recent years. He said: The applause in response to Biden name-checking Goodman, Freeman and Moss was noteworthy. This was the president acknowledging a sentiment that many liberals have been expressing — that any conversation about stemming political violence can’t, in earnest, ignore the actions of Trump and his followers. Goodman, the U.S. Capitol Police officer, was recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal for his heroism in the face of violent, pro-Trump insurrectionists on Jan. 6. Freeman and Moss were innocent election workers in Georgia who faced death threats after Trump and his movement targeted them after the 2020 election. And if it wasn’t clear enough from their resumption of political ads, Biden made clear that he won’t be treating Trump with kid gloves. “Now, just because we must lower the temperature in our politics as it relates to violence doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth,” Biden told the NAACP audience, before lambasting Trump for deploying the National Guard to quell racial justice protesters in 2020, his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic and his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After hitting pause on political attacks for a few days, it’s officially “game on” again for the Biden campaign."
What Nikki Haley’s RNC speech says about Trump's grip on the GOP,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 10:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nikki-haley-rnc-speech-trump-endorsement-rcna162187,"Nikki Haley, former President Donald Trump’s chief rival in the Republican primaries, called for the party to unite behind him at the Republican National Convention Tuesday evening. “Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” the former South Carolina governor declared to a roaring crowd. Haley addressed her speech to Trump skeptics in the party, saying, “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him” and argued that a unified GOP was required for “saving” the nation.    Haley’s plea to her supporters to fall in line behind Trump was more forceful and comprehensive than her soft endorsement of Trump in May. It marks the official end of her dalliance with pseudo-independence from the MAGA wing of the party. And her decision to do it without winning any concessions from Trump illustrates how much power he has, and how little leverage she has in trying to preserve some remnants of the old GOP. Haley ended her presidential bid after losing to Trump in all but two small GOP primaries. She suffered a blowout loss on Super Tuesday. She argued then that Trump had work to do after a primary season to win over the roughly 15% of the Republican electorate who preferred her to him. “It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,” she said when she ended her campaign in March. “At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.” While Haley espouses or accommodates many MAGA values, she still waged war against Trump during the primaries by attacking his character and calling him unfit for office. She described him as “totally unhinged” and pushed back against his thirst for “revenge.” She warned that he is “declining” cognitively and called him a “toxic” agent of “chaos” who lacks “moral clarity.” And she diverged from a key pillar of the MAGA worldview by stating that America doesn’t “rig elections” and acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.  Trump has, unsurprisingly, not heeded Haley’s calls for civility, nor has he tempered his rhetoric on revenge or rigged elections. He remains wedded to a divisive and combative rhetorical style in which he signals authoritarian ambition. He has continued to reject the results of the 2020 election and, after being convicted of 34 felony counts, he has impugned the legitimacy of the legal system. Nonetheless, Haley offered Trump an endorsement that was not only full-throated, but even helped revise his record and boosted him in an area where she has had sharp policy differences from him in the past: foreign policy. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, Haley diverged from Trump by staking out more hawkish positions on Russia than he did, including by making clear her belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. During the primaries, Haley denounced Trump for encouraging Russia to attack NATO allies. But in her RNC speech, Haley praised Trump as a guarantor of a “strong America” and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden — you know, the guy who is a NATO traditionalist and helped organize an unprecedented sanctions regime against Putin. Toward the end of her speech, Haley spoke about the importance of making the Republican Party bigger and more appealing to the general public. But she’s too smart and savvy of a politician to delude herself into thinking Trump has or ever will have an interest in changing his worldview to do so. Haley is a creature of the party, she has significant political talent, and she wants to remain a player. It would be surprising if she didn’t have her eye on 2028. Her conspicuous bending of the knee to Trump is the simplest way to ensure she has a chance to stay in the game.  "
Dems hoping to replace Biden on 2024 ticket get a clear deadline,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-hoping-replace-biden-2024-ticket-get-clear-deadline-rcna162344,"As far as President Joe Biden is concerned, the intraparty debate over his electoral future has run its course. NBC News reported this week, for example, that in recent days, the incumbent “has started to privately convey a new message to Democrats: The conversation about my future is over, and I’m getting irritated that you’re not realizing that. Biden has called several prominent allies individually to tell them to spread the word.” The president’s impatience notwithstanding, the Democratic discussion remains ongoing. The challenge for those in the party who still hope to replace Biden on the ticket is the rapidly closing window. In fact, The New York Times reported this week that Democratic National Committee officials were “moving swiftly” to confirm Biden as the party’s presidential nominee “by the end of July.” To put it mildly, Democrats who still want the conversation to continue were not pleased. In fact, congressional Democrats began circulating a letter seeking more time. It’s against this backdrop that NBC News reported: Ordinarily, Democrats wouldn’t nominate their presidential candidate until the convention, but party officials said the earlier virtual process is necessary to avoid a legal mess in Ohio. Republican officials in the Buckeye State insist there is no need for such steps, but DNC officials have responded that they don’t trust those officials’ word. And so, the window of opportunity — which, again, Biden already sees as closed — appears exceedingly narrow. Major Democratic donors still hope to wield some influence and nudge the incumbent off the ballot, not because they oppose him or his agenda, but because they’re convinced he’ll lose. For his part, the president has said he’s more concerned with the attitudes of Democratic voters than the party’s financial backers. The problem with this is that many Democratic voters seem to agree with the donors: A newly released national poll from the Associated Press found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats prefer to see Biden forgo his re-election plans. That number is roughly the same as the results of the latest NBC News poll, which found that 62% of Democratic voters want to see Biden end his candidacy. Survey data like this makes it difficult for the president to say the chatter is limited to “the elites.” It also comes against a backdrop of several other recent polls that show Biden losing the 2024 race to Donald Trump. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the list of members calling on the president to stand down is still inching higher: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who reportedly raised private concerns, is now going public, urging Biden to step aside. If there are others in the party who want the same thing, they’ll have to speak up in the coming days or forever hold their peace."
An Unsettling Few Days,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-unsettling-days-rcna162356,"After a traumatic weekend for the nation, MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord use their law enforcement expertise to take stock of the alarming assassination attempt of former President Trump. Then, they turn to Monday’s stunning dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case, after Judge Aileen Cannon took a page from Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence to view Jack Smith’s appointment as illegal. Andrew and Mary explain what options are available to the Special Counsel in appealing the dismissal. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” So, we’re taping late in the day on Monday, July 15th, because we wanted to get this to you as early as possible. So it’s going to come out Tuesday morning, but we didn’t want to wait to record until tomorrow and then have it come out at the end of the day because there’s a lot to talk about. And so let’s get started. Hi, Mary, how are you? Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: This is going to be maybe a little bit different because there’s two things that we’re going to be discussing. We’re going to talk about the shootings and the attempted assassination over the weekend. But then we’re going to turn to something that happened today, which is why we’re doing this today to get this out to all of you to talk about the Judge Cannon decision, what she did and some issues legally with what she did. And then, Mary, you and I have not had a chance to talk about this, but like what we would do next. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: What are the options for Jack Smith? I’m going to be really interested to hear what you think. But why don’t I turn it to you, but just let me remind people when we talk now about the shootings over the weekend. I think people need to remember that, Mary, you were in both, not just in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C., which you know, is the home base for all sorts of major things like inaugurations and big events that have potential violence, but you were head of the National Security Division. And before that, you were a senior official there. And so foreign and domestic terrorism are so much a part of your makeup in terms of both lawyers and the FBI and other parts of the intelligence community dealing with those situations. So I just want to make sure people were aware that we have you in a different role to draw on. And I have just a little bit of that from the FBI. Mary McCord: I was going to say, but you as well. Yes. I mean, not only were you at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, but also at the FBI and the General Counsel’s Office. Andrew Weissmann: So anyway, you don’t have to debate that. Mary McCord: That’s right. That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: This is like Alphonse Gaston. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So with that, Mary, I thought it would make sense. And I know when we were talking over the weekend, when this happened, what would you, if you were still in the National Security Division, what would you be looking for? What would you be doing? What kind of preventative things would you be concerned about when something like this happens? Mary McCord: Well, I appreciate that we’re going to lead off with this topic today, because obviously this is enormously significant. There was an attempted assassination of the major political candidate running for the presidential, I guess he’s still technically running for the nomination, but is the de facto nominee. And we have an election this year. Andrew Weissmann: I think actually, as we’ve been talking, I think he -- Mary McCord: Has already, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- technically been proclaimed. Mary McCord: That might be because we are Monday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time recording this. And, you know, you and I, Andrew, and many listeners will remember when the sitting president, Ronald Reagan, was shot in 1981, the last assassination attempt. Again, Donald Trump is not a sitting president, but he is a former president. He’s a major candidate for president. And so, you know, that’s been more than 40 years since we’ve had anyone come this close to actually killing someone in the presidency or a former president. And it should make everyone and it clearly has made at least most people across party stop, take note, and do, I think, some soul searching about where are we in this country that the rhetoric and the language that’s used in a lot of our discourse may have, we don’t know, contributed to this event. And also, even if that had nothing to do with this particular shooting, because we don’t know, and I want to foot stomp that, we do not yet know the shooter’s motive. Certainly, it’s time to think about where we are and are there things that we want to change. And even the former president, and you and I have certainly been critical about him many times, and there’s still many, many, many reasons to be critical about him. But he has actually, at least over the weekend, I think it might have changed a little bit today, has called for unity, and I understand has completely changed his speech for the RNC and is actually his campaign directed other speakers to not try to cast blame across the aisle and say things that there’s no proof of at this point. So just to start there, the other thing I think that’s so important, you appropriately said we’re going to talk about the shootings, and I started with assassination attempt, but shootings is accurate because no one should ever forget that a person was killed, a person did lose his life, and two other people were critically wounded. So this was a fatal attack, really, on our democracy. Andrew Weissmann: It was a murder and attempted murder. Mary McCord: That’s right. And so I want to talk about and get your thoughts too on the kinds of investigations that are happening and why. But one thing I want to say right off the top, particularly because you indicated my former role in national security, is that, you know, this is appropriately being investigated as a potential domestic terrorism attack. And people say, well, why is that and why do you say potential? So domestic terrorism under the U.S. code is not its own crime. It’s a crime of violence that violates any state law that’s done with the intent to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or to influence the policy of government through intimidation or coercion or in retaliation for government conduct. Andrew Weissmann: And what you just said, Mary, is that you’re reading from the definition in the United States Code of domestic terrorism. Mary McCord: Right. I’m paraphrasing, not reading from the statute because I know it so well. And the definition of domestic terrorism in the U.S. code is very similar, almost identical, almost word for word as the definition of international terrorism. It’s just that international terrorism can involve the same kinds of conduct that occur outside the United States but have some tie to the United States or they occur inside the United States, but they’re motivated by, say, a foreign terrorist organization like Al-Qaeda or ISIS, whereas domestic is sort of purely domestic, not motivated by a foreign terrorist organization. So, for one, it’s because it would at least, we don’t know until we know the motive, but there is at least some reason to believe because this was a political rally, right, that the intent would have been to affect government policy, to intimidate or coerce the people who are there at that rally, et cetera. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: The other reason that it is appropriately considered, at least in the initial stages as a domestic terrorism investigation, is because one of the potential crimes here, if the shooter had survived, would be a crime that is considered to be a terrorism crime, and that is an attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. You know, most of our crimes that are designated by law of crimes of terrorism are about things that have to do with foreign terrorist organizations like we talked about, but in the domestic sphere, it can include attacks on U.S. government officials, members of Congress, the sitting president, vice president, justices of the Supreme Court, et cetera. And there is actually a statute that also applies to attempted assassinations of major presidential candidates. And so that, when done with this intent, is actually a crime of terrorism under U.S. law. Andrew Weissmann: And for our nerds, which I’m including ourselves in that, we will put in the show notes the site for the statutory definition, as well as the citation for the domestic terrorism law that, Mary, you were referring to. Mary McCord: Yeah. So the crime I was referring to is 18 United States Code Section 351. But for all the nerds out there, we’ll put all these in the show notes. Andrew Weissmann: So I had a reaction to something you said, and it does relate to what I know if I were still at the FBI, what our teams would be focusing on, because there would be, as you said, Mary, very much this focus of what happened, a whole exegesis of who is this person, learning everything you can about the shooter and his motivation, and looking at social media, e-mails, texts, talking to witnesses, learning as much as you can to understand how this happened and why this happened. Mary McCord: But I think that’s for two purposes, actually, because I put this investigation in three buckets, right? I just wanted to get out there that it’s properly called, you know, terrorism investigation, or at least potentially. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, yeah. Mary McCord: So that first that you were just getting at, Andrew, to me, that serves two purposes. One is law enforcement needs to know now, is there any current ongoing threat, right? Is there still-- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- possibly someone that the shooter was working with, domestically or foreign? Are there other explosive devices in other places that could still pose harm? Because we know they’ve recovered some sort of explosive device from the car and some from the house. And so part of this is looking at, you know, the contents of the phone, laptop, his internet searches, social media posts, his acquaintances, where was the gun purchased? If it was purchased by his father in 2013, which is being reported, did his father know he had taken it? Where was the ammunition purchased? All those kind of things, first are like, do we have an ongoing threat? But secondly, all those same things that you were talking about, and I was elaborating on are to figure out, did law enforcement miss clues? Like, were there red flags that they should have had this guy on their radar? And are there things -- Andrew Weissmann: Lessons learned. Mary McCord: Yeah, lessons learned. Andrew Weissmann: Yep, absolutely. And this, by the way, reminds me so much, I think both of us were in national security roles during the Boston bombing. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And, you know, I was at the FBI and that was very much the sort of lessons learned and was somebody else involved. And, you know, so those are two big pieces. So I think that is sort of the looking backwards. The looking forwards piece, and obviously, if other people were involved, that’s a looking forward and actually lessons learned is also has a -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- looking forward piece. But another part of the looking forward is the concern of heightened threats and copycats going forward. And so an enormous amount of activity right now will be on other targets that either within the same genre or retaliatory targets. And how do you harden the, what was the phrase? Harden the shell -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and harden the target so that it’s harder for any of those things to occur. And that’s where I just want to take us back to a conversation we would have had a month ago or three months ago or six months ago. Actually, let’s just go back to the motion that was before -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- Judge Cannon with respect to the concern that was being raised by Jack Smith about threats to the FBI. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And both of us, if you remember, were very upset -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that it wasn’t heard sooner because both of us having been in law enforcement, but you don’t have to, you could just be a sentient human being who cares, knew that we didn’t want to be in the situation where violence has happened and there was more that could have been done. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And it is worth going back to the fact that violence has happened and threats of violence have happened. And obviously January 6th isn’t a good example. Paul Pelosi is a good example. But just to make this apolitical, Steven Scalise is a good example. Mary McCord: Threats to Brett Kavanaugh. Andrew Weissmann: I was going to say justices in the Supreme Court, regardless of stripe. Gretchen Whitmer and then judges, witnesses, poll workers, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss. I’m not saying that it’s wrong to have the reaction now that I hope this causes people to rethink that they should all be saying violence is never the answer. But it is ironic, to say the least, that this is what it takes. I mean, we were saying this for so long and there’s so -- Mary McCord: Years, really. Years. Andrew Weissmann: -- many people who have been threatened and actually hurt. Mary McCord: Harmed. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And if you belittle attacks on people and you make it the norm, I’m certainly not saying you’re asking for it, not in any way, shape or form. It’s that this kind of thing was bound to happen. And I hope this is a wake-up call, but I’m concerned it’s not. In terms of law enforcement, though, in terms of what we would be doing, looking at that future issue of like, is there going to be some immediate retaliation? Are there other targets? Are judges, are prosecutors, et cetera, going to have increased threats and increased security and concerns is certainly something that is going to be keeping the bureau, the Secret Service, the local law enforcement very busy. Mary McCord: Yes, no question about it. And we haven’t even talked about the fact that a whole separate investigation into the Secret Service’s behavior here is another thing that will be happening. And I can tell you, I am sure if they had their druthers, there would be no outdoor rallies and events like what we saw in Pennsylvania on the weekend. It’s just so much more difficult to protect than an indoor venue. And I’m sure that history will reveal that there was probably a lot of back and forth between Secret Service and the campaign over these type of events. But nevertheless, there clearly was a rooftop within striking distance that was not adequately protected. And so that will be the course of a lot of criticism. Last thing to say about this, and, you know, we could do a whole episode about this. It’s not obviously about prosecuting Donald Trump, although he has now today at least posted on True Social that all cases against him should be dropped, as well as apparently all former civil cases, including E. Jean Carroll. But putting that aside, I do think it’s important to realize, you know, just to your point, what’s going to come from this, right? And one man’s act does not control what we as Americans are going to do going forward, or what foreign adversaries will be encouraging some Americans to do going forward. We control that and how we react, regardless of our politics, will do far more to influence whether we’re going to have copycat crimes, whether we’re going to have retaliation. And some of that will be in the rhetoric that people use. Some of it will be social media. Some of it could be how people speak at events like the convention this week and the conventions coming up. But one man doesn’t control that. And that dead shooter who did a heinous thing at an event where people were expressing their constitutional rights, right, to go and have a rally in support of the candidate of their choice, that shooting is very much undermines our democratic processes, our constitutional rights. And we can decide to reject that. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, in the same way that we can decide that it has nothing to do with and, in fact, should make us value more the rule of law. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And so it has nothing to do with weaponization. And that’s maybe a very good segue to Judge Cannon because one of the things that, just to give a tease before we take our first break, is that in many ways, her ruling is the antithesis of weaponization. And if you look at the substance of what she’s saying, and I’ll talk about that a little bit more when we break, but the sort of Donald Trump claim that these are all weaponized cases that have been brought in, she is actually in substance rejecting that. Her whole claim is that Jack Smith was not sufficiently under the thumb of the Biden administration, and because of that, it was unconstitutional. So it’s actually quite the opposite of the claim that there’s weaponization. And just to bring it back and close out to your point, which is that the truly heinous acts of one individual does not mean that we are suddenly not a nation of laws. In fact, it should be why we’re a nation of laws and should make us value that more. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Let’s take a break and then go back to Judge Cannon and we’ll get into the details of her ruling issued this morning. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As we were going into the break, we were teeing up Judge Cannon’s decision and judgment today. Basically, the case in front of her is right now over. She dismissed the indictment, the superseding indictment in its entirety, and she did so really based on one ground, which is that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. She also indicated that it violated the Appropriations Clause, but said she wasn’t going to decide a remedy for that because it didn’t matter after all because she was dismissing the entire case based on the Appointments Clause. So we’re going to talk during this segment about her ruling, and then we will close out after another break by talking about what are the options now, what happens going forward. But just before I hand it to you, Andrew, I want to just orient people on what this Appointments Clause says in the U.S. Constitution, right? Andrew Weissmann: Perfect. Mary McCord: It says that the president shall have the power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties provided two-thirds of the senators present concur. And here’s the kicker. And he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint various people and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law, right? Okay, so that’s key. And those various people include ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court, okay, and all other officers for the United States. But the clause goes on to say, but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. Okay, so heads of departments would be people like the attorney general. And the key point of Judge Cannon’s 93-page opinion is there is no statute that gives the attorney general the power to appoint a person like Jack Smith, the special counsel. And she does that, I will say, and I’m curious whether you agree, I think based on the roadmap that Justice Thomas laid out for her in his concurring opinion in the immunity case that we talked about the very first day we talked about the immunity decision, because it was something not briefed, not part of the question in front of the court, and just something he decided to write about. And she grabbed it, and she cites it repeatedly. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So again, big picture things. We’ve had the special counsel rules for about 25 years. They replaced the independent counsel rules. And the independent counsel was in many ways more separate from the Department of Justice than the special counsel and was found to be constitutional in a case called Morrison. So that’s a case that’s somewhat controversial, but it is a binding Supreme Court case that said that the independent counsel rules were constitutional. So this, because it seems better, it’s people are like, how is this going to be infirm? And in fact, until Judge Cannon, no judge has actually found it to be improper. There have been special counsels appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents. There have been Republican and Democratic appointed judges who have found it to be constitutional. I keep on referring to Dabney Friedrich, a judge appointed by Donald Trump during the Mueller investigation, found this to be constitutional. So Judge Cannon is the first judge to find that it was unconstitutional. I totally agree with you that she is following the Justice Thomas blueprint, the gratuitous blueprint. Very, very unusual for him to do that. It’s very political. She does not, I think, follow binding Supreme Court precedent. She rejects all of the other, I think it’s eight judges who have found against her. And basically, the clause that you were reading, what you need to look for is, since the special counsels was not appointed by the president, you’re trying to see, is there some statutory authority that gave Merrick Garland, the attorney general, the ability to appoint the special counsel? And I have to tell you that part of her decision, I’m going to say this, but it doesn’t convey the depth of how wrong it is, but it is. To say it is weak is charitable. There is congressional authority to do this. Let me just give you an example of something she does that I just think is so silly. The attorney general can appoint employees, obviously, because the Department of Justice is filled with employees, and those employees can be given all sorts of job responsibilities. Mary McCord: Including prosecutors. We were both assistant U.S. attorneys -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- with a lot of authority, not, you know, nominated by the president or confirmed by the Senate. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I was the head of the fraud section. I was the general counsel of the FBI. Neither of those are Senate confirmed. I had tons of authority. I could go ahead and indict people as the head of the fraud section, as a federal prosecutor. I had lots and lots of authority. And one of the things that she says is, oh, yes, it’s true that the attorney general is given the ability to hire employees, but the special counsel is not an employee. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Mary McCord: I wonder where he got his paycheck from. I mean, that should tell us something. Andrew Weissmann: The reason it’s wrong is she latches on to the special counsel under the special counsel rules, should be hired from outside the department. But then they are brought into the department -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and they are called a confidential employee under the statute. And it specifically provides for the fact that they’re a confidential employee. This, by the way, is at page 24 of her decision. And so this is just one where she says, well, I’m going to look at their status before they were appointed a special counsel, as if that’s the time period you want to look at it. The time period is obviously after. So I really think that she completely blew it legally. I also think that it really is a sign that she’s never worked at main justice because she keeps on thinking about, oh, well, he’s sort of like a U.S. attorney, but he’s not been confirmed by the Senate. But you know what? I was the head of the fraud section. I had over 100 people working for me. That’s larger than many, many, many U.S. attorney’s offices people could indict all the time. The other thing is she sort of doesn’t take account of and makes it sound like the special counsel could just do whatever the hell he wanted and doesn’t have to comply with DOJ rules. And I think I’ve talked about this on the podcast. That is so not true. You have to comply with every single Department of Justice rule because you are within the Department of Justice. So I have given as an example of that when I was working for Special Counsel Mueller, we wanted to bring tax cases, we had to get tax division authority. That means they had to approve, not us, they had to approve this going forward. Why? That’s DOJ policy. We wanted to bring a Foreign Agents Registration Act charge, which is a type of national security charge. You know who we had to approve that? Mary McCord: National Security Division. Andrew Weissmann: The National Security Division. Mary McCord: I sure do, because I was there. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So again, we had to go through all of those internal rules. It’s not like we had just a notice requirement. We had to get approval. We had to do all of the approvals that anybody in the Department of Justice had. And I keep on saying when I was in the special counsel, I have never been more overseen, certainly far more than when I was the head of the fraud section. Mary McCord: I mean, it’s in the regulations. It’s not day to day, but it’s not day to day of an AUSA or a U.S. attorney either. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But still, they have to comply with what you and I know as and which are specifically referenced in here, what we call urgent reports, which means any U.S. attorney in the special counsel, when they’re getting ready to take an action in a sensitive investigation involving, you know, either a sensitive target or a controversial action, they have to run that up the flagpole in what is aptly called an urgent report so that the deputy attorney general and the attorney general have the chance to say, wait a minute, stop the presses. You’re not doing that. Andrew Weissmann: And the key word there is they have to. Mary McCord: Yes, it’s not optional. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not like, you know, we’d like it, Mary, if you would, could you just come by if you have time? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Doesn’t work that way. Mary McCord: In fact, at some point, she basically says it’s completely within the special counsel, their own discretion, whether to discuss things with the attorney general. But she takes that part of the regulations completely like out of context and ignores the reg that we were just talking about that requires mandates, urgent reports. So there’s a lot wrong with that. But I want to post something to you, though, because we can spend a lot of time talking about how she gets wrong her, you know, what type of officer he might be. But ultimately, I think her ruling doesn’t rest on that because she says, I’m going to sort of with reservations say he’s an inferior officer. But it doesn’t really matter because if you were a principal officer, then clearly this violates the appointments clause because he should have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. And so even if I consider him an inferior officer, the basis for her ruling is, in her view, there is no explicit statute that Congress passed that says Attorney General of the United States of America shall have the authority to appoint special counsels to investigate whatever the issue might be when there’s an investigative need. That I saw as the heart of her ruling. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And to me, that’s kind of insane, and how’s that for not using great legal language, which is that there are statutes like 28 U.S.C., I think it’s 533. Mary McCord: 533 that she says, oh, that’s about the FBI and inferior. She writes that one off. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. But I mean, I didn’t see that why that’s just about the FBI. So, again, just to be clear, the attorney general can appoint just to personalize it, can appoint someone to be the head of the Enron task force. They could appoint someone to be head of the fraud section. And you are within the Department of Justice and you have lots of authority, but you’re an inferior officer because you ultimately report to the attorney general and so I just don’t understand. Once you cave on the issue of, okay, this is an inferior officer, I think you lose because the department’s made up of inferior officers. That is like, what are you going to say that every single employee can’t be hired? And so she really doesn’t wrestle with what would be the limits on that authority. If there is no authority to hire underlings, then are the tens of thousands of employees at the Justice Department, all Congress had no idea that they could be appointed. And by the way, this is where the history of this is so much against her because you don’t have Congress in any way pushing back going, oh, wait, you’re doing something wrong and I didn’t understand it. Mary McCord: For decades and decades, through multiple special counsels, right? Not only did they never push back -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- not only did they withhold funding, they continued to put money, you know, to allow for money to go into the very source of funding for these various appointments. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, do you want an interesting factoid? Mary McCord: Sure. Andrew Weissmann: Because this may affect our -- Mary McCord: Our next discussion? Andrew Weissmann: -- our next discussion about what to do next, because I have like an idea. Mary McCord: Okay. Andrew Weissmann: But here’s a factoid that may be of interest to folks, but also could maybe something to think about in deciding what to do. When the independent counsel law was sunsetting and the independent counsel law was very critiqued because of sort of the Ken Starr people going overboard. Mary McCord: Six years or something, wasn’t it? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And remember, Brett Kavanaugh worked for Ken Starr, just, you know, FYI. And when it was sunsetting, there was a group of people on the Hill who were sort of tasked with thinking about what to do. And there were a whole bunch of people who were thinking about what is a way to have something that is more tethered to the Department of Justice, that is less independent. And ultimately, the department put out the regulations under Janet Reno. But in that group that came up with essentially the blueprint for this, one of the people who worked on the blueprint for what is the special counsel rules is. Mary McCord: Drumroll. Andrew Weissmann: Current Chief Justice John Roberts. Mary McCord: John Roberts. Andrew Weissmann: So he worked on these. It would be so interesting. And to me, it’s sort of like it’s how Brett Kavanaugh was so bizarre, in my view, in his immunity decision, given his role in the Ken Starr case and -- Mary McCord: And you may recall during argument, somewhat out of the blue, he also talked about Morrison v. Olson being, he thought, one of the worst decisions of all time. This is the decision that upheld the Independent Counsel Act, which has since sunsetted. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. So we have the current chief justice who was fashioning something to make this more tethered to the Department of Justice that would make it a stronger case for constitutionality than Morrison, which dealt with the independent counsel rules. So even if Morrison is good law, by the way, aren’t you struck by the fact that Judge Cannon just basically ignores that decision? Mary McCord: She doesn’t. Well, she talks about it, but when she’s trying to decide whether he’s inferior or not and she does apply things, but then she still, you know, says, well, in light of a case that came after that, I’m not so sure that’s right. She does a lot of very long winded explanations for things and oftentimes concludes, but I don’t have to decide this. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: I will say one other major factor, I think, of the opinion, and you’ve kind of alluded to it, is that many, many courts have upheld this and a lot of those courts have done so in reliance on U.S. v. Nixon, an obvious Nixon era case that was not about a prosecution of the president, but it was about seeking evidence from the president for a criminal prosecution of others related to Watergate. And so the issue of the independent counsel there, was he called a special counsel at that point? I think that’s before Independent Counsel Act. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: Yes. Leon Jaworski. Andrew Weissmann: Special prosecutor. Mary McCord: Right. Special prosecutor. There are a couple of sentences in that opinion, and that opinion does say that when there is a demonstrable need for evidence that can overcome the executive privilege of the president to withhold that evidence, that was the conclusion there. And that’s why when we go back and talk about the immunity case, I feel like the immunity case sort of seemed to overrule U.S. v. Nixon, but doesn’t say that it did. That’s for another day. But there’s another key part of this case, which says, Congress has vested in the attorney general the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States. It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties, citing a bunch of statutes that Merrick Garland relied on in his appointment of Jack Smith and which other attorneys general appointed by both parties have relied on. Then it goes on to say, acting pursuant to those statutes, the attorney general has delegated the authority to represent the United States in these particular matters to a special prosecutor with unique authority and tenure. They don’t call that into question. They don’t say, we’re not sure this is right. They don’t say this might violate the appointments clause. They just state this all as a fact. And then they go on to decide that the special prosecutor could subpoena that information from the sitting president, Richard Nixon, and overcome the president’s executive privilege. So what does Cannon say about that? She says, that’s dicta. Dicta, of course, is when the court says something that is not like load bearing to the merits of the opinion, is not necessary to the merits of opinion. And she says, no one had argued about whether the special prosecutor was constitutionally appointed there. The court didn’t really have to decide the issue. So their statement, essentially saying that he’s got valid authority, is mere dicta. Mind you, you really couldn’t have gone on to issue the decision -- Andrew Weissmann: Of course, right. Mary McCord: -- in that case if they’d have thought that the special prosecutor was unconstitutionally appointed. But that, she jettisons in her opinion. Andrew Weissmann: Quick anecdote, and then we’ll go to the question of what would you do now? When we were litigating this and won in front of every court, when Special Counsel Mueller was bringing his cases and every defendant was challenging this and every judge was affirming it, we used to joke with him and we said, well, you’re just a subordinate officer. Mary McCord: I’m sure you did. No question about it. Andrew Weissmann: You’re just inferior. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And he’s like, that’s very funny. But that was the critical language that he is subordinate to, inferior to the head of the department -- Mary McCord: It’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that is the attorney general. Okay, let’s take a break, and then we’ll come back with, if you’re Jack Smith, what would you do? (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. I know you’re dying to say what you would do. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, but I was going to turn it to you first, but what do you want? Do you want to go first? Mary McCord: Well, it doesn’t matter. I mean, okay, I’ll go first. So I would not make a decision immediately if I were Jack Smith, right? I would take some time. I would sleep on this. I would reread it again tomorrow. And then I would consult with my whole team. I would at least seek to consult with the deputy attorney general and the attorney general, not to mention the solicitor general, because if he decides to appeal this, which is very much an option, because this is one of the things, again, that prosecutors can appeal, a complete dismissal of your case. If he decides to appeal this, he has a decision to make about whether he wants to try, as he did in the immunity case, to go straight to the Supreme Court and skip the 11th Circuit, ask certiorari before judgment, or whether he wants to just go ahead and appeal as a matter of course to the 11th Circuit. So that’s clearly an option for him. Because there is some risk there that if and when this gets to the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas and a court that we no longer seem to be able to predict very well will not render a favorable decision. There’s another option. Andrew Weissmann: Guilty. Guilty. By the way, the 11th Circuit, you could also have, you know, this issue of whether they would bounce her because you could ask to have her removed or the 11th Circuit could do it on its own. But as you said, the Supreme Court could weigh in on that too. Mary McCord: That’s right. Anything in front of the 11th Circuit would be appealable to the Supreme Court. Now, they don’t have to take the case, right, if they agree with what the 11th Circuit did. And that all takes time, lots of time. Another option is that either the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida, technically it could be elsewhere like D.C., can just start over and indict the case, bring in a grand jury, present the evidence, and seek a new indictment. And in fact, you know, the National Security Division could, with respect to at least the classified information charges, also using another grand jury, do the same thing. And I kind of lean that way a little bit because then you avoid this entire issue of the appointments clause. You avoid it ever getting to the Supreme Court. But the problem here is I wouldn’t want to do it in D.C. because it would just look like you’re judge shopping. So I’d probably suggest that it happen in Southern District of Florida, which means you could just get Judge Cannon again. Then she’d maybe find a different way to dismiss the case. But you’d at least get beyond the appointments clause issue. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So this is really interesting. So my first reaction, and again, I would sleep on it, is that I would just go ahead and get a U.S. attorney’s office to bring in -- Mary McCord: Same thing I just said. Okay, we’re in agreement here. Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: I know. This is like a violent agreement. And the reason is Judge Cannon is saying the flaw here is that it wasn’t brought by a confirmed United States attorney. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Well, go ahead and do it. Mary McCord: Do it. Andrew Weissmann: It happens every day of the week. And by the way, when people say what’s involved, super easy. You have a grand jury, let’s impanel all the time. You could bring an agent in, they can put the transcripts of the prior proceeding, and it’s just a very easy process. And that way you just avoid delay and the uncertainty. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And I personally would want to avoid the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: Absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: You know, like the plague, because they’re so result-oriented. And so you could just be like, you know what, you think this is a problem? Mary McCord: You do it. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not, you’re wrong, but I can remedy this in about two seconds. So that is, I think, sort of step one. The harder issues are the sort of where do it is sort of a euphemism for, do you seek to remove her? Do you finally make a motion for her to recuse herself and try and take that up or have it go to the chief judge in the district court level or the 11th Circuit? And that’s where, in some ways, what you’re doing is the merits of the decision could be litigated in the context of how wrong she was in this. And that would also have some delay in it, which I think, I guess I’m a little less worried about -- Mary McCord: Same. Andrew Weissmann: -- because this case is never going to trial before the general election. And so I think I would sort of do it that way. There also is the ability to sort of have your cake and eat it too, in the sense that you could go ahead and bring this new indictment. And I still think there’s a little piece that’s alive for purposes of appeal. I’m not sure you’d have to do it that way. But because I think that there’s residual issues that remain, for instance, what would happen to the work and the evidence that was done when Jack Smith was -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- doing the work but wasn’t officially supposed to be there? And is there prejudice from that? What do you do with it? This is a way of saying there still might be standing that the case wouldn’t be totally mooted out if you were to bring a new charge, but then say that there shouldn’t be these ramifications. Mary McCord: I think it would just be procedurally different because she has dismissed this one. If they don’t appeal it, this is a closed case. If they re-bring and it gets assigned to her, and even if it doesn’t get assigned to her, I suspect that Mr. Trump’s team would argue that you couldn’t even introduce -- they don’t have a good argument here, but that you couldn’t even introduce the transcripts to a new grand jury because those transcripts were the result of subpoenas by Jack Smith, who was acting outside of any authority. So I think I’m getting it the same thing as you, but I think it would all be in the context of a new matter. And -- Andrew Weissmann: Unless you appealed it. Unless you did kind of both, you both appealed this matter. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Anyway, you know, this is like super technical, but the bottom line is that because this is such a technical decision, there is a way to remedy it. And I’d just like to go back to something I was saying at the outset, which is, as we’ve talked about, what she is saying is that the special counsel here was not sufficiently tethered to the Department of Justice, was not sufficiently tethered to the president of the United States. He wasn’t appointed by the president, and he wasn’t sufficiently under the control of the attorney general. That is the antithesis of the attack on the special counsel’s investigation by Donald Trump, which is that it is weaponized as being political. And she is not dismissing it for that reason. In fact, it is the opposite reason. And it’s really important for people to sort of realize that when he says, oh, look, everything’s weaponized, whatever her motives are, you know, when we can guess what they are and have a pretty good guess, her reasoning is the opposite. Mary McCord: Completely inconsistent with his claims and his rhetoric, yeah, throughout, which may change, but may not change in light of this new unity messaging that we’re looking forward to. And I’m not trying to be facetious there. I’m trying to be serious, but I’m not a hundred -- Andrew Weissmann: Skeptical. Mary McCord: -- percent yes, exactly. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, once again, it is, with all of this breaking news, but highly serious, the legal opinion that came out, and it’s so great to be able to talk to you about it. We have something special planned for next week because we’re going to be together and we’ll be doing a live show next week. And we’ll talk some more about that at the time. But in the meantime, really great to talk to you. Mary McCord: Same, Andrew. Thanks so much for listening. To send us a question, you can leave us a voicemail at 917-342-2934.

Ex-Trump aide Peter Navarro to speak at RNC after prison release,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/peter-navarro-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162294,"Former Donald Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro was released from federal prison in Miami on Wednesday morning. His next stop is Milwaukee, where he's scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention. Navarro served his four-month term following his conviction for contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with a House Jan. 6 committee subpoena. The Supreme Court rejected his bid to stay free while he appeals and his legal challenge is pending. Trump ally Steve Bannon is currently incarcerated for his own contempt of Congress conviction, which he’s appealing from behind bars after the Supreme Court also rejected his bid to stay free in the meantime. Navarro’s expected appearance on the convention stage comes shortly after Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey was found guilty on 16 counts in his federal corruption trial; top Democrats quickly called on him to resign. Meanwhile, Navarro’s criminal history isn’t a hindrance to him being platformed by the Republican Party. Indeed, the former Trump adviser’s speaking engagement doesn't come in spite of his conviction but because of it. The party's embrace of Navarro fits well within its “law and order” mantra, which doesn’t mandate a literal application of the law but is rather about maintaining a certain social order. The party’s presidential nominee was criminally indicted four times and convicted once so far, in New York state court (he pleaded not guilty in every case). Trump was supposed to have been sentenced in that case last week, but the sentencing was postponed after the immunity ruling handed down by the Supreme Court majority he helped appoint. If he wins in November, Trump is poised to get his federal cases dismissed by a new attorney general who’d presumably still apply the nation’s laws to those deemed the real criminals by the administration. Or Trump could attempt a legally untested self-pardon should he return to the White House. He has already said that he would grant clemency to Jan. 6 defendants, and he pardoned Bannon before leaving office last time. With that in mind, whatever Navarro’s political plans, his best legal strategy may be staying in Trump’s good graces.  "
VP Kamala Harris emerges as a main target at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republican-national-convention-kamala-harris-biden-border-rcna162291,"With President Joe Biden's nomination still on shaky ground, Republicans at their party's national convention this week have sharpened their criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden's likeliest replacement on the ticket. Harris was featured prominently in speeches over the first two days of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Speakers made sure to name her while criticizing the Biden administration's policies, and they sought to tie her to major election issues, including the border crisis — repeatedly referring to her as the ""border czar"" — and violent crime. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Tuesday accused Biden and Harris of welcoming a “Third World invasion” through the border. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley warned of “four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris” in her speech. She mischaracterized Harris' role in leading the administration’s effort to address the root causes of migration in 2021. “Kamala had one job — one job — and that was to fix the border,"" Haley said. ""Now imagine her in charge of the entire country?” Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt claimed that Biden and Harris opened the border “to terrorists, to criminals.” He also pointed to violent crime during the pandemic, saying Harris “shares in those failures.” Violent crime surged in 2020 — when Donald Trump was still president — but it has steadily dropped in the following years. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer also tried to link violent crime to Harris. “When Minneapolis was in flames and businesses were in ruins, Kamala Harris encouraged and enabled the criminals and the rioters,” he said, presumably referring to the 2020 racial justice protests. The attacks on Harris at the RNC are part of a broader GOP strategy to cast the vice president as a bigger target ahead of the November election. Reporting has indicated that while the Trump campaign hopes Biden stays in the race, believing it is easier to defeat him than any other Democrat, it is homing in on its attacks on Harris in case the president bows out. Trump himself has increasingly criticized Harris on the campaign trail in recent weeks, mispronouncing her first name and painting her as part of the “radical left.”"

Jim Justice declared, in apparent reference to his fellow partisans, “We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.” * Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen.

The details, however, are still being negotiated. * While abortion rights proponents in Arkansas apparently collected enough signatures to force a vote on a constitutional amendment, Republican Secretary of State John Thurston concluded that there was a technical problem with organizers’ paperwork. Not surprisingly, this is now the subject of a new lawsuit. * In related news, voters in Arizona are slated to vote in the fall on an abortion rights measure, but a Republican-dominated legislative panel wants to include language in a voter pamphlet that refers to a fetus as an “unborn human being.” This, too, is the subject of a new lawsuit. * In New Jersey, Democratic primary voters this week chose LaMonica McIver, the Newark city council president, as their choice to replace the late U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. The general election in this race is Sept. 18, and McIver will face Carmen Bucco, a small-business owner who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. * Late last week, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, announced it’s rolling back some restrictions on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. The New York Times reported, “Under the restrictions on Mr. Trump’s accounts, he could have been suspended from Meta’s services — which also include Threads and WhatsApp — if he had posted content that sought to delegitimize this November’s election, among other things. But Meta said it was now relaxing those restrictions, reducing the potential for a suspension if Mr. Trump violated the company’s terms of service.”"
"On crime, Republican convention speakers turn reality on its head",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 8:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/crime-republican-convention-2024-biden-reality-head-rcna162318,"Every time new data is released on U.S. crime rates, the political world ponders the same question: Why is it that the public believes crime is getting worse, when the evidence makes clear that crime rates are getting better? The answer is multifaceted, but it’s hardly unreasonable to think deceptive Republican rhetoric has made the problem worse. On the second night of the Republican National Convention, for example, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik railed against President Joe Biden’s “violent crime crisis.” House Speaker Mike Johnson made similar comments, declaring, “We can’t survive the dramatic increases in violence, crime and drugs that the Democrats’ policies have brought upon our communities.” Note the over-the-top hyperbole: To hear the Louisiana Republican tell it, crime hasn’t just reached crisis levels, it’s also reached the point at which the United States “can’t survive” such rampant crime. For now, let’s put aside the irony of Republican officials denouncing crime rates while simultaneously nominating a criminal for the nation’s highest office. Instead, let’s focus on the degree to which Stefanik, Johnson and several other convention speakers turned reality on its head. In fact, CNN reported a month ago on the latest statistics from the FBI showing a 15% drop in violent crime this year. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a written statement that the latest data “makes clear that last year’s historic decline in violent crime is continuing.” The reference to last year was especially notable because of the encouraging results from 2023. NBC News reported in March, for example, “that crime in the U.S. declined significantly in 2023, continuing a post-pandemic trend and belying widespread perceptions that crime is rising.” All of this, of course, follows a dramatic spike in the murder rate in 2020 — the final year of Donald Trump’s presidency. As for the political implications of the recent progress, I’m reminded anew of a line in a recent Axios report that stood out for me: “Polls show crime is a top concern ahead of the 2024 election — and it’s an issue where Republicans regularly edge Democrats. But falling homicide rates could take the steam out of the crucial GOP advantage.” That’s true; it could. That said, it’s difficult to have confidence that it will. Prominent Republican voices likely know that crime rates are falling. That apparently doesn’t stop them from telling the public the opposite of the truth, working from the assumption that many voters will simply believe the falsehoods and never hear about actual crime data. Circling back to our recent coverage, political campaigns have long followed some intuitive rules. Those looking to win tend to identify rivals’ areas of weakness and focus attention accordingly. Similarly, candidates have also taken care to learn about their foes’ strengths and steer their races away from those issues. But crime rates offer a great example of how contemporary Republican politics rejects the intuitive rules for a different model. The evidence makes clear that Biden has a compelling story to tell: Crime rates, most notably murder rates, spiked toward the end of his Republican predecessor’s term. Under the incumbent Democratic president’s leadership, Americans are now safer. Common sense might suggest that GOP officials would see the news and try to move the public conversation away from this area of strength for Biden. But as it turns out, they find it far easier to effectively say, “Why don’t we just make stuff up and wait for the public to buy it?” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why the GOP's ‘rule of law’ focus is literally unbelievable,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 7:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-convention-rule-law-trump-2020-rcna162302,"During her remarks at the Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird delivered an odd boast about her party’s approach to law enforcement. “We put criminals where they belong: in jail,” Bird said to applause. “That’s why we need to elect President Donald J. Trump.” If the Iowa Republican was aware of the contradiction, she didn’t show it. After all, a jury recently found the former president guilty of 34 felonies, which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault. By Bird’s reasoning, she and her party should be eager to put Trump behind bars, not in the White House. The state attorney general, however, was hardly alone. Vivek Ramaswamy, ignoring the former president’s crimes, insisted on the convention stage that Trump would “restore law and order in this country.” House Speaker Mike Johnson similarly declared, “We in the Republican Party are the law-and-order team. We always have been, and we always will be, the advocates for the rule of law.” My personal favorite was the speech from House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who practically shouted this incredible message: “Donald Trump stands with the people and the police — our men and women in blue — not with the criminals and rioters.” So, a few things. First, it was kind of amusing to hear the Minnesota congressman say Trump doesn’t stand with “rioters” when much of the former president’s candidacy is rooted in his support for rioters. Second, the idea that the former president stands with “the police” isn’t quite that simple. In reality, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. So much for ""back the blue."" Third, the House speaker’s claim that the Republican Party honors “the rule of law” is belied by overwhelming evidence. Revisiting our recent coverage, it remains true that a party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t nominate a person convicted of felonies for the nation’s highest office. A party that cares about the rule of law also wouldn’t try to undermine public confidence in the judicial system without cause. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t try to defund law enforcement agencies based on nonsensical conspiracy theories. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t endorse retaliatory, politically motivated prosecutions against innocent people. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t reward accused criminals, elevating them to positions in which they could help steer the party’s future. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t have a suspected criminal, indicted on election-related charges, oversee the party’s election-year legal efforts. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t rally behind a presidential nominee who’s running on a platform of pardoning violent criminals and putting them back onto the streets. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t nominate for president a criminal who’s surrounded himself with other convicted criminals. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t scramble to condemn one of its own after he encouraged voters to respect the legal process. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t boo police officers for telling them inconvenient truths. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t invite a convicted criminal to speak at their national convention within hours of his release from prison. The contemporary Republican Party, however, has done all of this and more — recently. It’s the same Republican Party that was indifferent toward Trump-era White House corruption, saw some of its members sentenced to prison, expressed indifference when their party’s then-president tried to weaponize federal law enforcement, and participated in a radical, dangerous, and unprecedented plot to overturn the results of a free and fair American presidential election. Partisans such as House Speaker Mike Johnson are welcome to claim that the Republican Party is “the law-and-order team,” but that won’t make it true. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Nikki Haley takes a circuitous route to a pro-Trump convention speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 6:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nikki-haley-takes-circuitous-route-trump-convention-speech-rcna162288,"Last year, after Donald Trump mocked House Majority Whip Tom Emmer and derailed the Minnesotan’s bid for House speaker, Emmer would’ve been justified in holding a grudge. Instead, the congressman went to great lengths to curry favor with the former president, offering Trump sycophantic support. “They always bend the knee,” Trump said soon after. The phrase came to mind watching Nikki Haley endorse her former primary rival at the Republican National Convention. A Washington Post report summarized: Haley nevertheless declared that she was giving Trump her “strong endorsement, period.” The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations didn’t have to do this. Indeed, plenty of her GOP contemporaries chose a different course. But Haley still wants a future in Republican politics, so she played the role of a loyal, partisan soldier. It’s worth pausing, though, to acknowledge the weird and circuitous path the South Carolinian has followed. Eight years ago, when there was still some question as to whether Trump would be able to take over the Republican Party, Haley was categorical in rejecting Trump — and Trumpism. “I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party,” she said in 2016. “That is not who we want as president.” Around the same time, Haley added, “I have to tell you, Donald Trump is everything I taught my children not to do in kindergarten.” A year later, Haley reversed course and joined Trump’s team. After Jan. 6, Haley reversed course again, telling Politico after the attack on the Capitol that Trump “went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. And we can’t let that ever happen again.”  Soon after, Haley reversed course again, re-embraced party orthodoxy, defended Trump, and vowed not to run against him in 2024. A year and a half later, Haley reversed course again and challenged Trump for their party’s nomination. During their primary fight, she told voters that the former president had become “unstable and unhinged.” After Trump went after her husband, Haley said Trump is “not qualified” to be president. She later reversed course again, leading to her convention endorsement. I’m reminded of something National Review’s Philip Klein wrote in 2021: “A few weeks ago, back when she thought tide was turning against Trump, Haley said he would be ‘judged harshly by history.’ Now she realized she got ahead of her skis and is trying to take it back. As I’ve written, she is a human chameleon. She thinks we’re too dumb to notice.” Plenty of Republicans have made the transition from Trump critic to Trump supporter. His own running mate falls into the category. But no one in public life has changed their minds about Trump more than Haley."
Why Ted Cruz’s ugly speech at the Republican convention matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ted-cruzs-ugly-speech-republican-convention-2024-rcna162274,"Eight years ago this week, Sen. Ted Cruz delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention. They were not well received. The Texas senator had just wrapped up his own failed presidential bid, during which time he got to know Donald Trump fairly well. Their relationship, however, could’ve been better: The future president went after Cruz’s wife and suggested Cruz’s father played a role in the JFK assassination. The senator, meanwhile, told voters that Trump was a “pathological liar,” a “bully,” a “narcissist,” “utterly amoral” and a “sniveling coward” with “a consistent pattern of inciting violence.” With this in mind, when Cruz spoke at his party’s 2016 convention, he couldn’t quite bring himself to endorse his former rival, instead saying, “If you love our country and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience.” The booing from attendees was relentless. In the years that followed, the senator did what most Republicans did and became a Trump sycophant. It was against this backdrop that the far-right senator spoke again at his party’s national convention — and this time, he received a far warmer reception than he did eight years ago. Cruz pleased attendees, not only by throwing his support behind the GOP ticket, but also by feeding the crowd the kind of anti-immigrant red meat that tends to generate strong reactions. Pitching the idea that the United States has become a violent hellscape as a result of undocumented criminals, Cruz went so far as to declare: “How did we get here? It happened because Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children.” To the extent that reality still matters, Cruz combined a series of lies to create one larger lie. The senator told people to believe that non-citizen voting is rampant, which isn’t true. He told people to believe that Democratic officials want support from non-citizen voters, which isn’t true and doesn’t make any sense. And perhaps most importantly, Cruz told people to believe that Democratic officials are willing to sacrifice the lives of American children — deliberately — in order to benefit electorally from the support from non-citizen voters, which is transgressive madness. A Washington Post analysis described the Texas Republican’s rhetoric as “grotesque.” Cruz is not a dumb man. He surely knows that his ugly rhetoric is false. He pitched it to a national audience anyway. So much for “unity.” Watching the senator’s appalling speech, I was reminded of recent chatter about Cruz turning over a new leaf. The Texas Tribune reported in April, for example, that Cruz, as part of his latest re-election campaign, was “casting himself as a bipartisan lawmaker with a penchant for reaching across the aisle.” The Wall Street Journal soon after published a related report, noting that Cruz is “rolling out a softer, bipartisan side,” and taking steps to “recast his image as a dealmaking lawmaker.” The article added, “His campaign even shot ads featuring ‘Democrats for Cruz.’” His convention speech made fools of those who believed such talk."
The dangerous story Trump fans are telling themselves at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-2024-election-inevitable-rcna162149,"Every four years, the two parties hold their national conventions and boast that their nominees are going to win the presidential election in the fall. Conventions are times to project confidence and unity. However, in speeches from and interviews with Republicans and their conservative allies at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, they’re expressing more than confidence in former President Donald Trump’s chances. They’re expressing inevitability. Even before the stunning events of the last several days, the mood among Trump’s devotees was that he can’t lose against President Joe Biden. The convention has seen Republicans double down on that rhetoric, throwing out any caution about predicting a blowout. It’s more than bravado. It’s a flashing warning sign for what may come if the tides shift before November. Since the presidential debate between Trump and Biden in Atlanta last month, Republicans have been more than happy to sit back and watch Democrats panic over their standard-bearer’s performance and debate replacing him on top of the ticket. Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania has further galvanized his followers’ belief that he can’t lose. “Let’s be honest,” former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said at the Heritage Foundation’s Policy Fest, held across the street from the RNC on Monday. “Trump just won. He just won.” Carlson, who will speak from the main stage at the RNC later this week, wasn’t alone in that thinking. Even as official speakers were told to be a bit more restrained in their speeches, the shooting was taken among Trump supporters as a sign that it’s impossible for him to lose. Evangelical leaders like Franklin Graham have joined members of Trump’s family and campaign in referring to his survival in biblical terms, framing the Trump victory that will follow as nothing short of God’s will. The New York Times reported that attendees viewed the incident as “just one more example of the way everything — everything — seems to be going their way.” To wit: Mere hours before Carlson’s speech, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon tossed out the federal classified documents case against Trump. One of his vanquished foes in the primaries, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, was scheduled to encourage her supporters to shift their allegiance to Trump, promoting party unity over her past criticisms. It’s no wonder the crowd went wild when the perfectly timed appearance of Trump, with his ear still bandaged, prompted a chant of “Fight! Fight! Fight!” from the gathered throngs. Republicans are feeling understandably geared up. But the GOP’s success isn’t quite the slam dunk that it’s being made out to be in Milwaukee, not with the election still months away. It’s worth bearing in mind that the predictions of a red wave in 2022 fizzled out, yielding the weakest midterm performance by a party that didn’t hold the White House has had in decades. And the polls still show Biden and Trump running neck and neck even after the tumult of the last few months. And as this week has already shown, there’s a lot that can happen between now and the election. It’s not even certain that the same issues Republicans hope to campaign on will be at play then. The convention’s theme Monday — “Make America Wealthy Once Again” — already clashed with reality. Despite the dire warnings from speakers throughout the day about the supposed horrors of the Biden economy, inflation has leveled off after its post-pandemic peaks, opening the doors to the Federal Reserve’s potentially cutting interest rates between now and November. And unemployment remains low. In these circumstances, some might find it wise to proceed with at least a little caution for fear of jinxing things. But it’s not just a lack of superstition that is undergirding the GOP’s sureness. The narrative that Trump and his allies have crafted is one that rules out any potential loss as illegitimate. According to an AP-NORC poll conducted last year, even before this feeling of inevitability manifested, 46% of Republicans already expressed little to no faith that November’s ballots will be counted accurately. Unlike in 2020, when only the most die-hard MAGA elected officials offered full-throated backing for Trump’s wild claims of Democratic election fraud, he will be supported this time by a vast and growing GOP infrastructure primed to do whatever it takes to ensure that failure isn’t an option. Conservative lawyers are already gearing up to target the U.S. voting system in the election’s aftermath, seeking to nullify a Biden win. The Republican National Committee has shifted resources to focus on “election integrity” over helping states drive people out to the polls. Confidence is a virtue; finding it impossible to believe you could be wrong, as Republicans now do, is hubris that could have dire consequences for the future of democracy. This is what makes it so dangerous for Democrats, reeling from the internal debate over Biden’s future, to buy into the idea that Trump’s win is inevitable, as well. Doing so would be tantamount to endorsing Republicans’ narrative. Democrats need to remember that there’s still time to prove the GOP’s certainty wrong and win in November — even if Republicans are unwilling to admit that such a thing is possible."
"Today’s GOP has no past, present, or future. It’s just Trump.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speakers-donald-trump-snub-rcna161770,"In his seminal dystopian novel, “1984,” George Orwell wrote “who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” Suffice it to say, Orwell would have had a field day at the 2024 Republican National Convention.  Indeed, there is no better example of former President Donald Trump’s hold over the modern GOP than this week’s near-total erasure of the Republican Party’s past. You might not be aware of it by watching the Republican convention this week, but the Republican Party is, in fact, 170 years old. It was formed in 1854 as an abolitionist movement opposed to the expansion of slavery into western territories. Its first standard-bearer was Abraham Lincoln, which is why the GOP is sometimes referred to as the “Party of Lincoln.” Nineteen presidents have been Republicans. But if you watch the 2024 Republican convention, you are likely to hear about only one: Donald Trump. It’s as if MAGA wiped the GOP slate clean and made 2016 its Year Zero. Other than Trump, there’s only one other living Republican ex-president: George W. Bush. He’s one of only four Republican presidents in history to win two presidential elections and serve eight years in office. And the chances of hearing Bush’s name mentioned in a positive light by convention speakers in Milwaukee this week are close to nil.  Twenty years ago, Bush was a revered figure within the GOP (for those of you who are younger, you’ll have to take my word for it).  But in the 16 years since he left office, Bush’s presidency has largely been stuffed down the memory hole — and it has been a bipartisan effort. Even Democrats don’t bother talking about his disastrous presidency anymore. While Bush left office with a historically low approval rating and a cratering economy, that’s not necessarily why he is persona non grata in the party he once led. Bush was an internationalist. Trump is an isolationist. W was pro-immigration and, by and large, opposed to demonizing people of color. Trump is, of course, the exact opposite. And Bush is part of a multigenerational political dynasty. In other words, for MAGA he is the embodiment of the dreaded political establishment.   But it’s not just Bush who has been kicked to the curb. There are also three living Republican vice presidents not in attendance — Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and Mike Pence. Quayle has been out of the limelight for years; Cheney is the father of Liz Cheney, whom Trump despises for her role in co-chairing the House Jan. 6 committee, and, of course, on Jan. 6 Trump helped whip up a mob that threatened the life of Pence, his former vice president — so it’s probably best he didn’t make the trip to Milwaukee. (Incidentally, it was Quayle who told fellow Hoosier Pence that he didn’t have the authority to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election.) How about the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney? He’s retiring from the Senate, in large measure because of his revulsion at the direction the party has taken since Trump won its presidential nod in 2016. (Of course, Trump hates him, too, as Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict at both of Trump’s impeachment trials.) Romney’s 2012 running mate, Paul Ryan, a former speaker of the House, might be in attendance in Milwaukee (he is, after all, from Wisconsin), but he’s not speaking. The same goes for 2008 nominee Sarah Palin. Her running mate, John McCain, passed away in 2018, but there won’t be any glossy tributes for him. Trump, infamously, mocked McCain’s time as a POW in Vietnam. The national convention where McCain is most likely to show up is the Democratic National Convention. McCain’s widow, Cindy, spoke there in 2020. The 1996 presidential nominee (and 1976 vice presidential nominee), Bob Dole, passed away in 2021. What are the chances that there will be a tribute to him at this year’s Republican convention? There wasn’t one in 2020 to honor former President George H.W. Bush, who died in 2018. Will there even be a reference to Ronald Reagan, the president to whom Republicans tied themselves for decades after he left office? It’s hardly a guarantee, which once would have been sacrilegious at a GOP event but today is practically par for the course (although if one wants to see the new Reagan biopic starring Dennis Quaid, it’s showing every day in Milwaukee). Historically, political parties have a tendency to turn their backs on failed presidents or losing candidates. There weren’t many Republican conventions that extolled the virtues of Herbert Hoover after his disastrous one term in office. The same goes for Richard Nixon, the only president who was forced to resign. But even Nixon got a shoutout from the party’s presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996.  For Democrats, Jimmy Carter might have lost re-election in 1980 and is generally considered a failed president — but that didn’t stop Democrats from giving him a prime-time speaking slot at the next three conventions. This year, one can fully expect prime-time speeches from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. It wouldn’t be a surprise if Al Gore, John Kerry or Tim Kaine made appearances.  But at this year’s RNC, it’s as if there was no Republican Party before Trump came along. And, in a sense, that’s true. The current incarnation of the GOP bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan or the Bush family. The only real blast from the past is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. I could identify only two speakers who worked in the Bush administration. It’s now the party of Trump and Trumpism, of political outsiders and rebels — and the only price for entry is pledging one’s fealty to the leader (not the party). Of the dozens of speakers over four days in Milwaukee, virtually all came to prominence in just the past decade or so — and largely on Trump’s coattails. People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kari Lake, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Matt Gaetz are the faces of the modern GOP. Their rises to prominence have little to do with adherence to GOP policy orthodoxy or even their political chops but rather their willingness to prostrate themselves before Donald Trump — and fully embrace his many lies.  In Trump’s GOP, there are no legacy, no coherent ideological beliefs and no enduring political tradition. There is no past, present or future. There’s just Trump."

Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week’s top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Donald Trump’s selection of Sen.

He’s essentially Arizona congressional candidate and gun whisperer Blake Masters with a beard. Or a cherubic Elon Musk with a lighter wallet. By which I mean Vance, a rich Silicon Valley tech bro, is all-in on the idea of a far-right technocracy. After the announcement, social media users started to shine light on a computer programmer turned far-right proselytizer named Curtis Yarvin, a peddler of racist pseudoscience (he espouses a belief in “biological roots of intelligence”) who’s been cited favorably by Vance and Masters, among others. Vox published a piece in 2022 that quotes Vance as name-dropping Yarvin and citing him as the inspiration for his opinion that Trump should replace all the government bureaucrats with “our people.” Here’s how Vox describes Yarvin’s worldview: Definitely something voters might want to consider when they cast their ballots this fall. Elon Musk, who has helped to push voices on his social media platform to the right, is officially wading into the 2024 presidential race with a massive spending campaign — he has promised $45 million per month to a Trump-affiliated PAC — to get out the vote for Republicans this fall.
