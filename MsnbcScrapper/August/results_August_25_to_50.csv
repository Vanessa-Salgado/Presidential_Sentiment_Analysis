Why Kamala Harris is getting the last laugh after Trump’s CNN interview criticism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:26 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 29, 2024, 8:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cnn-interview-rcna168598,"The hype preceding Kamala Harris’ first and utterly unremarkable “sit-down” interview as a 2024 presidential candidate is a reminder that nobody running against Donald Trump is ever graded fairly. Imagine arguing that Harris, an elected district attorney, attorney general of California, U.S. senator and incumbent vice president, should treat an interview with a CNN reporter as a high-stakes affair; that is, that she could say something that made her appear less qualified than Trump. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, apparently believing Trump’s ticket needed even more misogyny, suggested in a social media post Thursday that Harris would be incapable of holding her own. It is as it has ever been since Trump has been on the political stage: We watch to see if anything Trump says isn’t a lie, and we watch to see if other politicians say anything that’s the least bit false. In an ideal world, nobody would have been sitting on the edge of their seats wondering if Harris would sound knowledgeable or prepared for an interview — if only because she could never sound less knowledgeable or less prepared than her opponent so often does. The interest in the CNN sit-down was elevated, though, in large part because the media had made it such a big issue that she hadn’t done such an interview in the first place. And along with the suggestions that a candidate is deliberately avoiding the media come the suggestions that she’s afraid of the media. Harris exhibited no such fear Thursday. She came across as the typical politician — and I mean that in every sense. She directly answered the questions that she thought would benefit her candidacy, and she was deliberately evasive on specifics. To her credit, I think that the American media has wrongly contributed to what I’ll call the fetishization of a president’s first day in office. No, the vice president didn’t give a convincing answer when asked what she’d do “day one,” and yes, CNN’s Dana Bash asked the question again in a bid to try to force her to answer it. But the bigger problem isn’t so much that Harris didn’t give a straight answer; it’s an absurd question — even if it’s one that political journalists have come to think they have to ask. In setting the stage for the interview, recorded at Kim’s Café in Savannah, Georgia, CNN showed a clip of Trump saying of Harris, “She’s not a smart person.” That’s the same tack Vance took in his social media post that likened Harris to a young beauty contestant completely overwhelmed by an interview question. It’s hard to know exactly what part of that attack on Harris’ smarts we should assign to sexism and which part we should assign to racism. But there’s no denying the presence of both. Former President Barack Obama, president of the Harvard Law Review and a “senior lecturer” in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, was one of the most cerebral presidents we’ve seen, and, yet, there were billboards and bumper stickers that, referring to the country where his father was born, read, “Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing its idiot.” But Harris, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem recently pointed out, doesn’t want to get trapped in questions about identity. We saw that when she addressed Bash’s question about Trump’s lying and saying she only recently described herself as Black. She told Bash, “Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.” Nor did she focus on race and sex when asked about the viral photo of her grandniece watching her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. She said she wants to be the president for everybody. Her opponents are going to work hard, though, to reduce her to those elements of her identity. And slyly suggest that because of those elements she’s not up to the task. But they’re the ones seemingly not up to the task, seeing as how they set a bar so low that she couldn’t help but sail right over it. In response to the interview, Trump described it as “BORING!!!” He wasn’t wrong about that. But I think Harris is banking on voters’ choosing boring over the drama — no, let’s be real and call it the chaos — that Trump inevitably brings."
I’m a combat veteran. Here’s why Trump’s Arlington stunt was so insulting.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-arlington-national-cemetery-grave-photo-rcna168767,"Serving in a unit like the 101st Airborne Division can feel like a job. It’s a normal, everyday thing. Even in combat. It’s not until after you leave a famous unit like that — after you leave the Army, in fact — that you realize it is a privilege to lead and serve alongside such soldiers. It’s not until much later, among the regular people at the office, that you realize how unlikely it is that anyone around you would ever grab three guys and come running if you were pinned down or out of ammo. In the Army, you take those things for granted because everybody does it. They do it. They don’t question it. They don’t all survive. I survived and I’m old now. Not truly old. I’m 46. But old in the Army sense. I’m no longer carved out of wood. My left hamstring groans at the thought of running more than a mile. Doctors have taken an interest in my colon. But I realize this is a privilege. It’s a gift. Being old, I mean. Aging out. For once, I’m finally aware of the privilege in the moment. I am old. But I have friends who are still in their 20s. Friends who should be in their 40s. Some of them are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. That is what makes Arlington a special place. And for those of us who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, Section 60 — the burial site of hundreds of service members killed in those wars — is the inner sanctum. It is the most sacred plot among more than 600 hallowed acres. When I lived in Northern Virginia during Barack Obama’s administration, I avoided Section 60 studiously. It was too much, and still too close. There was always that looming sense that it could’ve been me. Maybe it should’ve been me. So I didn’t visit until I was about to move back to Dallas. An Army buddy told me I had to go before I left D.C. So I did. Finally. All of this is to say that, to combat veterans, Arlington National Cemetery has the same power that all holy places have. And that is why Donald Trump’s recent behavior is so repulsive. Trump was so eager to use Arlington’s Section 60 as a backdrop for a campaign event this week that he may have broken federal laws against politicizing the burial ground to do it. Trump’s staff also shoved aside a cemetery official trying to stop them. He even posed for a photograph over a U.S. Marine’s gravesite, grinning and giving a thumbs-up. The moment was jaw-droppingly crass and vulgar, as all of Trump’s are. It defiled sacred ground. But of course, Trump’s disregard for military tradition and his disdain for military service members is well documented. This incident was only the latest in a long line. Trump began his adult life dodging the draft for Vietnam. Someone else went in his place. Maybe that person survived. Or maybe they’re buried at Arlington with thousands of other Vietnam veterans. 'Whatever the outcome, the thought has never troubled Trump. He later told Howard Stern that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases was “my personal Vietnam.” When those comments resurfaced during his first run for president, his supporters shrugged them off. “It’s a joke!” they said. “He’s a showman!” If it had only ended there. In 2015, responding to criticism from Sen. John McCain, a former POW, Trump claimed, “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” However one feels about the Vietnam War, few Americans have given more for their country than John McCain. That didn’t matter to Trump. A year later, after Trump proposed the first version of his “Muslim ban,” the parents of Army officer Humayun Khan took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Khan is buried at Arlington, having been killed in Iraq in 2004. His parents gave an impassioned plea to voters, laying out how service members of all faiths had sacrificed their lives in America’s wars. They denounced Trump’s attempt to single out Muslims. He responded by spending days attacking the grieving Gold Star family. General Mark Milley told The Atlantic that when he invited a wounded, wheelchair-bound soldier to sing “God Bless America” at Milley’s welcoming ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, Trump admonished him. “Why do you bring people like that here?” Trump asked, according to Milley. “No one wants to see that, the wounded.” On a trip to France in 2018, Trump declined a scheduled visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where more than 2,200 U.S. service members are buried. “Why should I go to that cemetery?” he asked staff members. “It’s filled with losers.” This horrific statement was confirmed by Trump’s then-chief of staff, John Kelly, a former Marine general whose own son was killed in Afghanistan and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Kelly also confirmed that in another conversation on the same trip, Trump called the Marines who died at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. And just a few weeks ago, Trump told an audience that the Congressional Medal of Freedom he’d awarded to Republican donor Miriam Adelson was “much better” than the Medal of Honor. Trump said the civilian award was superior because Medal of Honor recipients are “either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets or they are dead.” These are not one-off statements by a rhetorically reckless buffoon. This man harbors deep resentment toward the military and those who’ve sacrificed in service. Even when he poses with a family — as he did at Arlington this week — he only does so to enhance his campaign or his political prospects. Trump’s use for the military and our dead extends only as far as it suits him. All Americans should keep this front of mind as we head into the fall. In particular, veterans should remember that Donald Trump’s behavior at Arlington National Cemetery this week epitomizes not only how he is a menace to the United States, but how he is an enemy of everything we fought for."
Donald Trump's disrespectful Arlington photo-op should not come as a shock,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-arlington-photo-military-jd-vance-rcna168853,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 28 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes."" If there’s one thing we know about Donald Trump, it’s that he’s going to be exactly who he is — all the time, every day, no matter what. Nothing ever really seems to stick to him politically. Trump was just indicted all over again by another federal grand jury and he’s celebrating an endorsement from a suspected whale decapitator, but there is a scandal that has the former president and his aides scrambling for cover. It has to do with a bizarre photo op he did on Monday at Arlington National Cemetery. Trump can be seen grinning and giving the camera a thumbs-up over the grave of a Marine killed in Afghanistan. That appearance was off-putting enough by itself. But then, NPR reported that Trump campaign staff at Arlington had gotten into an altercation with a worker at the cemetery over their filming among the graves of the dead. The Trump campaign’s top spokesperson downplayed the incident in a statement to NBC News: “For whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony.” But the worker had a good reason, Arlington National Cemetery suggested, telling NBC News that a report has been filed on the incident and adding in a statement: Trump’s co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, told NBC News that Trump went to the cemetery to honor Gold Star families not to film a political campaign ad and Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio tried to play it off, saying it wasn’t a political ad and there “just happened to be a camera there.” There just happened to be a camera? Trump went to a military cemetery to film a video reminding viewers of the U.S. deaths during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, blaming his successor for them without mentioning that Trump tied his successor’s hands by agreeing to a withdrawal timeline set by the Taliban. But that’s not a political ad, right? But Trump wasn’t the only politician capitalizing off of that Arlington visit. He was accompanied by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah. Cox used photos of the event to solicit donations in a campaign email — a violation of federal law and something the governor now acknowledges was a mistake. Trump’s team, however, isn’t admitting any mistakes. Instead, they’ve got Vance, the member of the Republican ticket with some military experience, responding on the campaign trail. Vance chastised the media for turning the altercation “into a national news story” and noted that Trump was invited by the family of the fallen marine: ""They wanted Donald Trump there, and thank God that we have a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them.” It’s true Trump was invited … but not by all the families of all the 400,000 veterans and dependents buried at Arlington — who didn’t and can’t consent to being used as props by a few other bereaved families. Beyond Vance disparaging someone who works at Arlington National Cemetery for enforcing the rules, is Trump really “a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them?” Donald “I don’t like losers, I like people that weren’t captured” Trump? The Donald Trump who spent much of his first presidential campaign attacking the parents of an American Army officer who died in Iraq in 2004? The Donald Trump who, as president, fumbled the name of a fallen soldier in a condolence call to his widow then bickered with her and knocked her in interviews?  The Donald Trump, who according to his chief of staff — a retired four-star Marine general — refused to pay his respects at a veterans cemetery in Europe, saying, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” And who, on that same trip, called the more than 1,800 Marines who died at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. Or was it the Donald Trump who reportedly hated being filmed or photographed with wounded veterans? At Army General Mark Milley’s welcoming ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 2019, the general had chosen a combat-wounded soldier, Luis Avila, to sing “God Bless America” at the ceremony. Milley claimed that afterward, the president told him, “Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.”  Less than two weeks ago, Trump used war-wearied American service members as a punchline to talk up one of his biggest political donors. Recalling the moment Miriam Adelson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Trump told the crowd: So you could be forgiven for looking at all of this and thinking that Trump only has respect for the most revered American institutions — the military, the justice system, the free elections — only when they’re working for him.

I understand why Harris delayed her high-stakes interview. It was still a mistake.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 2:49 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-cnn-interview-rcna168867,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 29 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Vice President Kamala Harris’ first interview as a presidential nominee is set to air on Thursday. Harris will be joined by her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. The interview comes after the vice president faced intense criticism for not formally sitting down with the media since entering the presidential race.  The political operative in me gets what Harris is doing. She’s spending her time on the campaign trail, making her case to voters. Why not push off the first big interview for as long as you can? On the other hand, as a citizen — and as someone who loves journalism and believes in transparency — I can acknowledge it’s not the best look. I’m not saying she has to do these huge prime-time interviews with well-known anchors but, why not sit down for an interview with a local journalist? She’s traveling around the country, hitting swing states — she should take advantage of that. If she’s on the road in Georgia, this is the perfect opportunity to sit down with a journalist there.  Harris has to show the American people she’s accessible and she can think on her feet. This is just an unforced error on her campaign’s part. It makes her look like she is too protected, too hesitant. Certainly, Harris can give an interview — after all, she’s the vice president of the United States."
"RFK Jr. says his endorsement of Trump is a ‘really difficult issue’ for his wife, actor Cheryl Hines",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 2:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-wife-cheryl-hines-trump-endorsement-rcna168858,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, is not on board with his support for Donald Trump. Speaking with TMZ, Kennedy said he had endorsed the former president against his wife’s wishes, calling it a “really difficult issue” for her. “This is the opposite of what she would want to do,” he said. “She went along with it because she loves me and she wanted to be supportive of me, but it was not something that she ever encouraged, I would say.” Kennedy said his wife had encouraged him — “out of compassion” — to accept an invitation to meet with Trump after the July assassination attempt. He said she then attended a meeting he had with Trump to make sure that no “hasty decisions” were made. “Her trepidation about this and discomfort with this ... were the dominant feelings,” said Kennedy, who suspended his independent bid for president last week after initially seeking the Democratic nomination. “She’s a lifelong Democrat and the idea of me supporting Donald Trump as president was just ... something that she would have never imagined, that she never wanted in her life.” Hines had released a statement on X after her husband left the race to thank those who worked on his campaign, but the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star made no mention of his support for Trump. Hines has had to distance herself from her husband’s political stances before, including when he brought up the Holocaust at an anti-vaccine rally. She also has faced criticism from her peers over Kennedy, with “The West Wing” star Bradley Whitford calling her out last week for staying silent about her husband’s support for Trump. Kennedy told TMZ that he “had to suppress some strong feelings” about Whitford’s comments, which he called “a template for bullying.” Hines’ disdain for Trump had been clear long before her husband dropped out of the race. Earlier this year, when a Variety reporter asked Kennedy whether he would accept an offer to be Trump’s running mate, he pointed at Hines and said: “I don’t think that my marriage would survive it.” Hines responded: “I think he’s right.”"
Nebraska Supreme Court to decide on laws allowing those with felony convictions to vote,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/nebraska-felony-conviction-voting-appeal-rcna168863,"With all the voting rights litigation mounting in courts ahead of the 2024 election, another important case to watch is unfolding in Nebraska. The state Supreme Court just heard arguments over whether people with felony convictions can vote.     Continuing a well-known theme, the case stems from Republican court efforts to seek political advantage over Democrats at the ballot box.  The case had a more bipartisan origin, when state lawmakers passed legislation in April to allow people with felony convictions to vote after they’ve completed their sentences. The new law built on a 2005 law that let people with felony convictions vote two years after they’ve completed their sentences.     But just before the new law was set to take effect last month, Nebraska’s Republican attorney general, Mike Hilgers, opined that both laws are unconstitutional, reasoning that only the state pardons board, not the Legislature, can restore voting rights.  And who’s on that pardons board? That would be Hilgers, Republican Secretary of State Bob Evnen and the state’s Republican governor, Jim Pillen, who didn’t veto the new law but nonetheless expressed constitutional concerns and encouraged Hilgers and Evnen to “promptly” look into it. Backed by Hilgers’ legal opinion, Evnen told election officials not to register people with felony convictions to vote if they hadn’t been pardoned. The court heard oral argument Wednesday, and its decision carries vast implications. The American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the case on behalf of would-be voters, told the state top court in a filing ahead of the hearing that The implications of the court’s impending ruling could be national: While Nebraska has historically voted Republican, like Maine it doesn’t use a winner-take-all system for its five Electoral College votes. Rather, the winner of the popular vote gets two and then the other three are split among its congressional districts. That led Joe Biden to pick up one of them in 2020, from the competitive Omaha-area district, which Barack Obama also won in 2008.

Harris sends letter to HBCU students as her college voter push continues,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 1:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-hbcu-letter-election-rcna168874,"Ahead of a planned college campus tour in battleground states, Vice President Kamala Harris penned a letter to students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on Wednesday, encouraging them to vote and laying out the stakes of this year’s elections.  The Democratic presidential nominee released her letter as an ad through Watch The Yard, which publishes content related to Black colleges and universities, Black Greek organizations and the Black collegiate experience. An HBCU graduate in her own right, the vice president has spent a lot of time on college campuses mobilizing voters over the last few years. In September 2023, she went on a “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” to promote reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ equality and freedom from book bans. She also appeared on ESPN during a bowl game for her alma mater, Howard University, last winter to tout the value of HBCUs. And she was back at Howard earlier this month hyping up students. The bonds she built with college voters then seem to have sowed the seeds for the surge in young voter support she’s seen as Democrats’ presidential nominee. So it follows that Harris and her team are making even more concerted efforts to get college students to the polls. They recently announced a “back to school"" campaign to engage young voters across 150 campuses in battleground states. Her letter to HBCU students this week is more proof of how crucial the Harris-Walz campaign thinks young, college-going voters will be to their election bid this fall. In the letter, Harris said her time at Howard had a “profound impact” on her and said HBCUs are where Black youths are “constantly reminded you are young, gifted, and Black.” She said college is “when I started to become politically engaged” and where she “learned that progress in our country happens when young people fight for it.” Harris said college students’ record turnout in 2020 is the reason she’s vice president today, and she declared “fundamental freedoms” are at stake this election, citing voting rights, marriage equality and bodily autonomy under threat from anti-abortion lawmakers.  “Your vote has never mattered more,” she wrote. “I know that when young people fight for progress, it changes the course of our nation. I believe in you. I am inspired by you. And I am rooting for you.” Both the Harris campaign and its allies, and the Trump campaign and its allies, are taking diverging approaches to college voters this year. While Harris and Trump both speak about the need for young voters to turn out, Trump, tellingly, is the only candidate in the race whose allies have openly promoted efforts to make it harder for college students to vote."

The Supreme Court made Jack Smith’s case much harder. His new indictment proves it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-indictment-jack-smith-supreme-court-rcna168667,"In the wake of the Supreme Court's stunning decision on presidential immunity, legal experts had a variety of predictions of what would happen next in special counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case. But once Smith's office advised Washington, D.C., federal judge Tanya Chutkan earlier this month that it needed more time to ""assess the new precedent ... including through consultation with other Department of Justice components,"" I realized one reason Smith could need more time was to supersede, or replace, his own indictment to resolve the Supreme Court's clearest concerns. And on Tuesday, Smith did exactly that. Others — including my colleagues Jordan Rubin and Hayes Brown — have written about the changes in the new indictment, both big and small, and what's likely to happen next in the litigation. But assuming the stripped-down indictment can survive both judicial review and November's election (if Trump wins, we can assume his Department of Justice will put an end to his federal criminal cases), what really interests me is Smith's removal from the indictment of multiple alleged conversations between Trump and executive branch officials and how those deletions have complicated his case at trial. The charges against Trump — all four of which remain — necessitate showing not only that Trump falsely claimed there was outcome-determinative fraud in the 2020 presidential election and that he had won, but that he knew these claims were false at the time he made them and conspired to change the election outcome. The original indictment alleged that the sources of Trump's knowledge included senior Department of Justice leaders, including then-Attorney General Bill Barr and his successor, then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, as well as senior White House lawyers, namely then-White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy Pat Philbin. That document quotes Philbin as having told Trump, ""[T]here is no world, there is no option in which you do not leave the White House [o]n January 20th."" In the new indictment, however, Smith has eliminated any and all references to conversations in which DOJ leaders, White House staff, and agencies within the intelligence community allegedly informed Trump that one or more claims about voter fraud were unproven and/or false — or simply that he had lost the election period. It's no secret why Smith did this. Under the Supreme Court's immunity decision last month, Trump's communications with executive branch aides are either part of his core constitutional powers, as the court held with respect to his interactions with DOJ leaders, or at the very least, within the outer perimeter of his official duties so that they are presumably immune both from prosecution and as evidence even as to his unofficial conduct. But now, the case won't include some of what seemed to be the most damning proof that Trump knew he lost. The conversations through which Barr, Rosen and Rosen's then-acting deputy, Rich Donoghue, disabused Trump of his false claim that votes cast through voting machines had been ""switched"" from him to Biden in multiple, contested states? Gone. The time Barr also told Trump there was no evidence of a ""suspicious vote dump"" in Detroit? Gone. How about when Rosen and Donoghue separately told Trump that the claim there had been 200,000-plus more votes than voters in Pennsylvania was also untrue? Cut. Or what of Trump telling then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley in early January 2021 that ""it’s too late for us"" to take action on an ""overseas national security issue"" and they should ""give that to the next guy?"" Nowhere to be found. Then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe's assuring Trump that there was no outcome-determinative foreign interference in the election? Like it never happened.  The superseding indictment is a reflection of a weird, dual reality for Smith and his team: In order to save their case, they also had to jettison some of their best proof. The question now is whether what's left is powerful enough to prevail. My guess is yes, in part because some of the most important witnesses are still important in GOP politics and therefore, all the more credible if they tell the truth. Indeed, without testimony from official Trump World, those who directly communicated with Trump about his failure to win come from two camps: state officials who refused to do his bidding and his own campaign staff. (The Supreme Court’s opinion suggests Trump’s discussions with both state officials and his campaign staff constitute unofficial, personal acts that do not qualify for immunity.) Consider, for example, two events that the new indictment alleges went down on Dec. 8, 2020. First, the indictment notes that a ""Senior Campaign Advisor — who spoke with the Defendant on a daily basis and had informed him on multiple occasions that various fraud claims were untrue,"" dismissively described those fraud claims in an email as ""just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership"" that unsurprisingly had resulted in more than 30 court losses to date. Those details are hardly new, but they could carry even greater weight going forward given their source: once and current Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is perhaps even more prominent within the inner circle today than he was in 2020. The new indictment also alleges that Trump called Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr and asked him to join the so-called ""original jurisdiction"" lawsuit that Texas had filed in the Supreme Court. But Carr declined, telling Trump, according to the indictment, ""that officials had investigated various claims of election fraud in the state and were not seeing evidence to support them."" And Carr, who defeated a Trump-endorsed opponent to win re-election in 2022, remains unbowed, at least so far, refusing to reopen an investigation of the 2020 election in Georgia's Fulton County despite a directive from the Georgia Election Board. I can't imagine Miller or Carr would necessarily welcome testifying in a Trump trial. But I also can't envision the Supreme Court ruling their testimony is ultimately off-limits under the contours of the immunity decision.

JD Vance thinks that means I’m ‘brainwashing’ students.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-childless-teacher-brainwash-randi-weingarten-rcna168805,"In recently resurfaced comments, Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance asserted that childfree teachers “brainwash” and “destroy” the minds of children. As an educator, I hope women everywhere, in every profession, are listening. During a 2021 leadership forum hosted by the Center for Christian Virtue, Vance was asked how he’d handle issues with schools while senator. In his answer, he took aim at Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, saying, “You know, so many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they’re people without kids, trying to brainwash the minds of our children.” “If she wants to brainwash and destroy the mind of children,” he added, “she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.” To be clear, Weingarten is stepmother to two daughters and has publicly described herself as “a mother by marriage.” But her family status is irrelevant to her capacity to lead the nation’s teachers.  I began my career as a middle school English teacher in New Jersey. When I was studying for licensure, I was required to take university and state exams focused on content knowledge and best practices, all with a foundation in child psychology and the science of learning. I gained experience designing lesson plans, assessments and rubrics that account for the myriad learning styles that populate classrooms across this country each year. At no time during my path to teaching was I questioned about the status of my womb and whether gestation would enhance my ability to work with children and their families. When I became a teacher, my students and I read books together. I taught them to analyze text and write essays across several genres. In my classroom, students learned about the art of informed argumentation and how — in the words of Plato — opinion is the lowest form of knowledge. They also learned new vocabulary and grammar and everything else that one might expect of a classroom in which literacy development is front and center. I like to think that what my students learned while in my care helped set them up to pursue success in their chosen professions. When I met my students’ parents to talk about their child’s progress, at no time was I questioned about my reproductive status, or how that status related to my ability to educate their children. All parents simply want to know that the person standing at the front of the room is competent in their chosen profession and cares about their child as a whole person. I now teach at the college level, in a teacher preparation program. My students are some of our nation’s future teachers. My curriculum includes the nuts and bolts of teaching and has been adapted to account for the issues facing schools, classrooms and students today. We work on how to not only create lesson plans, but also build inclusive classroom communities where all children feel safe and cared for, and where parents can feel confident knowing that their children are in good hands. It doesn’t even occur to me to wonder about my students’ reproductive organs or their future goals for family planning. Why? Because I’m not weird. A teacher’s willingness to be a mother, or a desire to remain childfree, has absolutely no bearing on their capacity to care for the children who will some day occupy a seat in their classroom. Also, not all of my students have wombs. Which leads me to my next point: It’s no accident that Vance speaks this way about a female-dominated profession. He has a well-deserved reputation for demeaning women and their work at nearly every turn. Just as he denounced childfree women who have cats, and said nothing of the childfree men who also have cats, so too does he also vilify teachers who do not have children, and says nothing of the fact that not all teachers have wombs. Perhaps next, it’s women in any profession with only one or two children who meet his disapproval. Vance has shown us that, indeed, there is no bottom, no misogynistic low for which he will not strive. It’s fitting that Vance’s comments have resurfaced as a new school year begins. As I type this, all teachers — regardless of whether they have children — are currently digging into their own pockets for supplies that experience and wisdom tells them their new students will need. I personally know teachers who keep drawers stocked with nonperishable food for students to access, no questions asked. Every day, my own social media feed is full of teachers posting links to their classroom wish lists, pleading for assistance that they can’t get anywhere else. Many of the folks I describe here are childfree, but they care and want to do a good job for other peoples’ children, which is why they go into teaching to begin with. It goes without saying that the Republican Party has long had an axe to grind for educators. For years, GOP lawmakers like Vance and their allies have lobbed misinformed attacks against us and the work we do. Most recently, the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 proposes dismantling the Department of Education, which — not coincidentally — is the entity that funds public schools. But Vance’s comments are not really about teachers. He has made it clear to American women: There is nothing we can do outside of raising children and grandchildren that meets his approval. And all coming from a man who can’t even seem to order doughnuts in a way that isn’t cringe-inducing."
Gov. Greg Abbott's brag about a mass voter purge in Texas is not what it seems,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/texas-voter-roll-purge-greg-abbott-rcna168815,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week that more than 1 million people have been removed from the state's voter rolls over the past three years, touting the removals as part of an effort to protect voting rights and prevent voter fraud — an already illegal and exceedingly rare occurrence that Republicans have made a centerpiece of their attacks on immigration. In a statement on Monday, the Republican governor attributed the mass purge of ineligible voters from state records — which he said included “noncitizens, deceased voters, and people who moved to another state” — to election legislation he signed in 2021. “Illegal voting in Texas will never be tolerated,” Abbott said. “We will continue to actively safeguard Texans’ sacred right to vote while also aggressively protecting our elections from illegal voting.” But his statement doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Election experts have said that such removals are simply routine voter roll maintenance (not to mention a requirement under federal law) and warned that Abbott's remarks could reinforce distrust in the election process. (“A spokesman for Mr. Abbott referred questions to the secretary of state’s office,” The New York Times reported.) A coalition of voting rights groups in the state have also raised concerns that eligible voters may have been wrongly flagged as noncitizens and removed from voter rolls — which is already happening in other states, as NBC News reported. Abbott's claim that he is protecting voter rights is also suspect, given that Texas Republicans have been accused of creating unnecessary burdens for nonwhite and disabled voters by limiting access to the ballot box, especially in blue pockets of the state. Just last week, state Attorney General Ken Paxton ordered raids on the homes of prominent Latino Democrats and members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), a nonpartisan Latino civil rights groups. Paxton claimed that the operation is part of an ""election integrity investigation,"" but his office did not explain why specific homes were targeted. LULAC said that it had not been informed of the details of the allegations against any of its members. The group has asked the U.S. Justice Department to open a probe into Paxton's office for potentially violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
Why JD Vance heard boos while appealing to firefighters’ union,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 12:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-heard-boos-firefighters-union-walz-election-2024-rcna168855,"It’s no secret that both the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets would love to receive a 2024 endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters, which is meeting this week in Boston. It’s why Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz addressed the labor union on Wednesday and received a warm welcome. A day later, his Republican counterpart’s reception was noticeably frostier. NBC News reported: I realize there’s a degree of subjectivity in such matters, but the booing sounded pretty robust to me. A Washington Post report added that the GOP vice presidential nominee was booed yet again during the same appearance after he referred to the Republican Party as “the party of the American worker.” It’s not too surprising that much of the audience in Boston knew better. As a New York Times report summarized just last week, Vance’s running mate has a record that trails after him like cans tied to a bumper: “[T]he Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board under Mr. Trump generally took a deregulatory approach to worker issues and union protections. His administration argued that employers should be able to prevent workers from bringing class action lawsuits, and sought funding cuts for workplace safety programs. His deputy labor secretary once worked as a lobbyist to prevent the federal minimum wage from applying to the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth where some workers earned less than $1 an hour.” An Associated Press report last year came to a similar conclusion: “[U]nion leaders say Trump’s record in the White House speaks for itself. Union leaders have said his first term was far from worker-friendly, citing unfavorable rulings from the nation’s top labor board and the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as unfulfilled promises of automotive jobs.” It was around this same time that the former president suggested UAW union members shouldn’t pay their union dues. That anti-labor rhetoric was hardly unusual. Just two weeks ago Trump participated in an online event with conspiratorial billionaire Elon Musk, whom the Republican candidate praised for taking a hardline with employees. “They go on strike,” the former president said. “I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, ‘That’s OK. You’re all gone. You’re all gone. So every one of you is gone,’ and you are the greatest.” The New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg soon followed with a column on this, with a headline that read, “Trump Is No Longer Even Pretending to Champion the Working Class.” With this in mind, if Vance was surprised to be booed, he shouldn’t have been."

5th Circuit sides with nonviolent marijuana user in Second Amendment appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 10:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/5th-circuit-nonviolent-marijuana-user-second-amendment-rcna168773,"We’ve seen some absurd gun rulings recently, including a Trump-appointed Kansas judge’s decision dismissing machine-gun charges under the Second Amendment and Supreme Court precedent. A new ruling out of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — which has handed down its share of wacky opinions on all sorts of issues, including guns — shows that the Supreme Court’s firearms jurisprudence, however illogical it is, can lead to a more sensible result. That ruling came Wednesday in the federal case of Paola Connelly, described by the 5th Circuit panel as “a non-violent, marijuana smoking gunowner.” One of the laws she was charged with violating in Texas was 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3), for allegedly possessing firearms and ammunition as an unlawful user of a controlled substance. The three-judge panel summarized the facts this way: To figure out whether her Second Amendment rights were infringed upon, the panel had to decide, under recent Supreme Court precedent, whether the law “is consistent with our history and tradition of firearms regulation.” The panel concluded that history and tradition may support “some limits on a presently intoxicated person’s right to carry a weapon,” but not “disarming a sober person based solely on past substance usage.” So the 5th Circuit agreed with Connelly’s challenge as it applied to her case specifically (what’s called an “as-applied” challenge) while rejecting her challenge to the law itself (what’s called a “facial” challenge). “Just as there is no historical justification for disarming citizens of sound mind, there is no historical justification for disarming a sober citizen not presently under an impairing influence,” Judge Kurt Engelhardt wrote for the panel. The Trump appointee was joined by Judges Jerry Smith and Irma Carrillo Ramirez, who are Reagan and Biden appointees, respectively. Government prosecutors had analogized drug use to historical restrictions on the mentally ill, but the appeals court rejected that comparison, reasoning that: “While intoxicated, she may be comparable to a severely mentally ill person whom the Founders would disarm. But, while sober, she is like a repeat alcohol user between periods of intoxication, whom the Founders would not disarm.”  The court likewise rejected the government’s reliance on the historical disarming of “dangerous” people: While true and seemingly supporting a logical result here, such an observation highlights the absurdity of the analysis in these cases in modern times. It’s an analysis that the likes of Hunter Biden will want to harness in his own case, after he was found guilty in Delaware federal court in June on multiple counts, including the 922(g)(3) charge. Biden’s case falls under a different appeals court, and it would take another Supreme Court ruling to set a national standard. In the high court’s most recent Second Amendment ruling this past term, United States v. Rahimi, the court upheld gun restrictions on people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. The ruling suggested that the court isn’t prepared to take its 2022 Bruen precedent, which laid out the historical analysis test, as far as it can go. The drug-related issue is one of multiple important questions raised by recent Supreme Court rulings, but as the Rahimi case showed, it will be up to the justices to handle each specific issue as it comes to them.

Vance: Harris can 'go to hell' for criticisms of Trump campaign over Arlington incident,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 10:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-kamala-harris-go-to-hell-trump-arlington-rcna168765,"Sen. JD Vance has defended the Trump campaign over an altercation with an Arlington National Cemetery staff member, instead criticizing Kamala Harris over the controversy and telling an audience she ""can go to hell."" In remarks at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Vance cited the deaths of 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, blaming the vice president for not having investigated the withdrawal or firing anyone. “Sometimes mistakes happen — that’s just the nature of government, the nature of military service. But to have those 13 Americans lose their lives and not fire a single person is disgraceful,” he said. “Kamala Harris is disgraceful.” “She wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up?” he added. “She can — she can go to hell.” Vance's comments are not just disrespectful — although they follow the example that Trump has maintained throughout his political career — they're also inaccurate. As The Washington Post pointed out, the criticism from the Harris' campaign spokesperson was merely to call the incident “pretty sad” but “not surprising coming from the Trump team” on CNN on Wednesday, and Harris herself has not said anything about it in public. Even as Vance has bristled at the criticism, accusing the Harris campaign of “trying to make a massive political issue” out of the incident and blaming the media for having “turned it into a national news story,” the Trump campaign's own indignant response to the incident has kept the story in the headlines. Rather than admitting it had defied federal laws that bar political activity at gravesites in Arlington, the campaign released a video that included the grave of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a combat veteran who died in 2020, without his family's permission. Marckesano's sister told The New York Times that the Trump campaign did not adhere to visitation rules, saying, ""We hope those visiting this sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected accordingly."" In addition to the scandal of politicking at the cemetery, a Trump aide pushed a cemetery employee out of the way so that the campaign could take photos and video, NBC News reported Wednesday, citing two Defense Department officials. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the employee a “liar” in response. What's more, Cheung and Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita have disparaged the employee in deeply personal terms, suggesting she had a “mental health episode.” The employee initially filed an incident report with military officials but later declined to press charges, fearing retaliation from Trump supporters, according to the Times."
"The U.S. manufacturing story JD Vance wants to be true, but isn’t",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 9:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-manufacturing-story-jd-vance-wants-true-isnt-rcna168822,"During his latest appearance on “Meet the Press,” Sen. JD Vance eagerly boasted to NBC News’ Kristen Welker that Donald Trump brought “manufacturing jobs back to our country” during his term. Moments later, the Republican vice presidential nominee went into more detail. “Because if you go back to the Trump presidency, we had 12,000 factories that were built during Donald Trump’s presidency,” the Ohio senator declared. For those keeping an eye on Vance’s rhetoric, the comments were familiar: He made the identical claim, nearly word for word, a week earlier on “Fox News Sunday.” What’s more, it’s not just the senator: Trump himself has repeatedly made the same boast, including in his final State of the Union address before losing his re-election bid. So, is it true? The Washington Post published a very helpful fact-check report. Quite right. For the purposes of data analysis, the Labor Department counts “factories” as businesses that “transform materials or substances into new products.” In other words, if you opened a bakery, that’s a “factory.” If you knit cute little frogs and sell them on your porch, that’s a “factory,” too. It’s why Vance’s claim garnered the dreaded “Four Pinocchios” assessment in the Post’s report. And while that assessment seemed more than fair given the circumstances, we can go a bit further and note that those looking for an administration with more legitimate grounds to boast about American manufacturing shouldn’t look to Trump; they should look to his successor. CNBC reported last week: In fact, the aforementioned Post article noted that if Vance wants to brag about the creation of nearly 18,000 additional “manufacturing establishments” under Trump, that same number would be nearly 39,000 under Biden. As The New York Times’ Paul Krugman summarized in a column in April, “President Biden appears to be presiding over the kind of manufacturing surge Trump had promised. ... [T]he fact is that Biden is actually doing something Trump boasted about but never achieved: promoting a significant revival in U.S. manufacturing.”"

Why Trump should avoid relitigating his infamous ‘dictator’ comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-avoid-relitigating-infamous-dictator-comments-rcna168798,"Donald Trump covered a fair amount of ground in his latest interview with Phil McGraw (better known as “Dr. Phil”), but one unexpected part of their conversation touched on notorious comments the former president made late last year, when the Republican candidate talked about becoming a “dictator.” A Fox News report summarized: “And I said ‘one day,’ because I wanna do the energy and I wanna strengthen the border, one day, and it was said with a chuckle, the audience laughed, I laughed, we all laughed,” he added. “But they take it and they cut it, and then they cut it, and it says ‘I wanna be a dictator.’ These are very dishonest people that we’re dealing with. Very dishonest people. Bad people.”When the television personality — the host, not the candidate — asked whether the comments had been taken out of context, the former president replied, “All you have to do is watch it.” If Trump wants to relitigate the controversy, that’s fine, but he might not like where this ends up. The controversy began in early December 2023, during an on-air interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The host, a close ally to the former president, prompted Trump to say he wouldn’t abuse his powers, but the GOP candidate replied, “Except for Day One.” When the host seemed surprised, Trump added, while pointing to Hannity, “He’s going crazy. Except for Day One.”Offered an opportunity to explain himself, Trump suggested that he’d use dictatorial powers to “close the border” and approve increased oil drilling. When Hannity again tried to help his pal, the GOP frontrunner doubled down. “I love this guy,” Trump said, referring to Hannity. “He says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said: ‘No, no, no — other than Day One.’ We’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.” As the video of the exchange makes clear, the context doesn’t much help. Republican officials insisted soon after that the former president was kidding. That defense proved unsustainable: In the weeks that followed, Trump repeated the line over and over and over again.In other words, this wasn’t just a single “joke” in a single interview; the GOP candidate, on multiple occasions, spoke publicly about his intention to serve as a temporary American dictator. I can appreciate why the former president, months later, wants to downplay the significance of his own rhetoric, but Trump said what he was quoted saying.

McCormick's campaign reposted a tweet from a right-wing account on X about an undocumented immigrant accused of a crime in Philadelphia, adding its own commentary blasting his opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for their supposed ""open border policies."" But the story was about Philadelphia, Mississippi -- not the City of Brotherly Love. Casey's team wasted no time, with spokeswoman Maddy McDaniel noting the mistake and adding a little snark to boot. McCormick's team deleted the tweet and shared another one in its place featuring news headlines framing immigrants as threats to Pennsylvania. But unfortunately for him, the flub managed to highlight his weak point. Like other Republican Senate candidates this year, he’s been called out for being uber-wealthy and spending ample time living outside the state where he’s running for office. McCormick rents and frequently visits a multimillion-dollar mansion in Connecticut, where he also ran a hedge fund. So the cop confusion — in addition to exposing his campaign's bigoted arguments — isn’t helping him beat the carpetbagger allegations."
Don’t fall for Mark Zuckerberg’s Trump-friendly suck-up,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 8:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/mark-zuckerberg-letter-jim-jordan-biden-administration-rcna168708,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg threw some red meat to the MAGA crowd on Tuesday. And based on some of the headlines alone, one could be forgiven for believing, at first glance, that Zuckerberg’s allegation of having been “repeatedly pressured” by the Biden administration to remove social media content that conservatives have obsessed over was, well, rooted in fact and principle rather than politics. That’s why I’ve appreciated the outlets that framed Zuckerberg’s letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan properly: as a rhetorical gift — or mere groveling — to Republicans at a key moment in a critical election. For context, Republicans have spent the past few years crowing about purported censorship and anti-conservative bias by the government and social media companies. And after all that time, including several House hearings and closed-door interviews, they’ve got nothing to show for it. In fact, all they’ve proved is that content moderation is a difficult task that is — and this is crucial — fundamentally left to social media companies to handle on their own. But Zuckerberg’s letter nonetheless aligned with conservatives’ claims. He showed contrition for not having been “more outspoken” about the “government pressure” he claims his companies faced from the White House in 2021 to remove certain content related to Covid-19, some of which he portrayed as “humor and satire.” But he then acknowledged that the decision about what content to allow was Meta’s, saying he feels strongly that his companies, including Facebook and Instagram, “should not compromise” their own standards. He also said that Meta shouldn’t have “demoted” a news story about the Biden family and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Republicans often point to this action as proof of anti-conservative bias, despite the fact that the guidance came from the Justice Department during the Trump administration — not exactly a bastion of liberalism. Zuckerberg also wrote that he won’t be making financial contributions toward boosting the country’s electoral infrastructure — as he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did in 2020 — in order to “be neutral.” Republicans have falsely said these grants unfairly aided Democrats, and Zuckerberg essentially cowed to them. But let’s keep it real: The Meta CEO has seemed far from “neutral” this election cycle. Zuckerberg has sucked up to Donald Trump, saying that seeing the former president “get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” He has made it harder to track the spread of misinformation on his platforms, and his company has also hired a former Project 2025 employee. Disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz wrote a great thread on X in which she made the case that Zuckerberg’s letter is all about self-preservation … and copying Elon Musk’s fealty to conservatives. Check out Jankowicz’s full thread here."
Trump’s online tantrum targets Harris with crude sexual remark,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 7:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-tantrum-kamala-harris-crude-sexual-remark-election-2024-rcna168793,"Even those who’ve grown accustomed to Donald Trump’s tantrums were taken aback by his latest online antics. An Associated Press report summarized: The former president’s timing could’ve been better. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released a new ad this week that argued, among other things, that Trump would seek revenge against his perceived foes in a prospective second term. It was against that backdrop that the Republican nominee used his social media platform to promote: But in case that wasn’t quite enough, a New York Times report highlighted what was arguably the most offensive item in the GOP candidate’s avalanche of ugly nonsense. The Times’ report added that the “repost was the second time in 10 days that the former president shared content from his personal account making sexually oriented attacks on Ms. Harris. Though he has a history of making crass insults about his opponents, the reposts signal Mr. Trump’s willingness to continue to shatter longstanding norms of political speech.” It’s worth emphasizing that in each of these instances, it wasn’t Trump who personally created the offensive online content. But that hardly makes the circumstances any better: The former president apparently saw these ugly messages and deemed them worthy of amplifying to his vast online audience. What’s more, his willingness to target Harris with a crude sexual remark dovetails with related rhetoric Fox News host Jesse Watters, who told viewers this week that the Democratic nominee, if elected, will “get paralyzed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her.” One of his co-hosts at the time, Jeanine Pirro, urged him to ""take it back."" (Watters denied that his remark was intended to suggest “anything of a sexual nature.”) Trump boasted this week that he’d be “great for women” if voters return him to the White House. There’s fresh evidence to the contrary."
Jim Jordan targets daughter of judge from Trump’s hush money case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 6:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-targets-daughter-judge-trumps-hush-money-case-rcna168760,"As Donald Trump’s recent criminal trial drew closer, the former president lashed out at a variety of people across the legal system, including likely witnesses in his hush-money-to-a-porn-star case. It led Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the proceedings, to impose a gag order on the Republican to help protect the integrity of the process. Trump, who has an affinity for going after the family members of his perceived foes, responded by going after the judge’s daughter — publicly and repeatedly. The GOP candidate’s allies, including House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Donald Trump Jr., soon followed down the same path. Four months later, the party is still at it. The Hill reported: As things stand, Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee’s far-right and conspiratorial chairman, wants the company’s CEO both to give a deposition and sign an affidavit that Authentic Campaigns was not in communication with Merchan. To be sure, to know the Ohio Republican is to know how irresponsible he is — I made the case last fall that Jordan is the single worst member of Congress — but even by his standards, these latest antics are tough to defend. The underlying conspiracy theory is that the judge in the Trump case might have somehow been in league with his daughter and her partisan campaign efforts. It’s a difficult idea to take seriously. As my MSNBC colleague Lisa Rubin explained, “The House Judiciary Committee has been told plainly that the digital strategy firm with which Judge Merchan’s daughter works has not done any work for the Biden or Harris campaigns this cycle and that she herself does not work with any relevant political clients. They’ve also been told about the death threats to her and the firm’s founder. Yet today, they subpoenaed the firm, as if it, as opposed to the committee or Trump himself, has engaged in misconduct.” What’s more, Authentic Campaigns’ founder, Mike Nellis, has explained to Jordan, in writing, “Authentic had no role, involvement, or influence whatsoever in those judicial proceedings,” Nellis wrote, claiming that his company has had no contracts with Biden for President, Harris for President or the Democratic National Committee since January 1, 2023. A report in The New Republic went on to note, “Nellis called Trump’s claims that Loren Merchan had raised tens of millions off of Trump’s trial ‘unequivocally false.’ He also lambasted the committee for ‘using valuable time and taxpayer dollars to perpetuate a false right-wing conspiracy theory,’ calling it a ‘disgraceful misuse of power.’” There’s no reason to believe this Republican crusade will end anytime soon, but it certainly should."
The Trump-Vance campaign is in (another) crisis of its own making,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/jd-vance-childless-women-teachers-insults-rcna168686,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 28 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is making headlines yet again after another one of his rants about childless women resurfaced. This time, Donald Trump’s running mate turned his ire to educators — attacking Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, during a Center for Christian Virtue leadership forum in 2021: Let me just say, as a person who has not birthed a child from my own womb, I take grave offense to these comments. I don’t know what children Vance himself has birthed — it’s my understanding that it was his wife who had the children — but it seems the senator just can’t help himself from opening his mouth and disparaging large swaths of the American public. Most Americans probably don’t agree with the idea that if you don’t have children, you don’t have a stake in this country’s future.  Obviously, this isn’t the first time Vance has attacked women without biological children and every time another one of these rants is unearthed, further damage is done to the Trump-Vance ticket.   This all goes back to the importance of vetting in a presidential campaign. I recently spoke to former Attorney General Eric Holder, who ran the vetting process for the Harris-Walz campaign. During that conversation, I asked him if he was sure his team got everything and that no stone was left unturned. Holder told me he combed through the internet and watched hours of videos of the top contenders.   So, I just have to wonder: What was the vetting process like for Vance? Because this is simply insane.

"For Trump, Arlington National Cemetery controversy goes from bad to worse",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 5:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-arlington-cemetery-controversy-goes-bad-worse-rcna168747,"As the week got underway, Donald Trump probably thought going to Arlington National Cemetery would be a good idea. The former president, despite his awful record related to respecting U.S. troops and veterans, appeared eager on Monday to exploit the third anniversary of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghans. As a result, the Republican nominee attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was quickly followed by a thumbs-up photo-op at a gravestone in Section 60 of the cemetery, where many service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. At that point, the story was already problematic. On Tuesday, however, the matter took a turn for the worse amid reports of an “incident” involving Trump aides and someone who worked at the cemetery. A day later, the controversy continued to intensify. NBC News reported: Republicans might’ve hoped this scandal would be a one-day story. I have some bad news for them. It’s a story with a surprising number of moving parts, so let’s summarize where things stand. Where will the controversy go next? Watch this space."
