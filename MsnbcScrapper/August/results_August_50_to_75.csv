Ex-Nevada politician found guilty of murdering journalist,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 12:24 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 29, 2024, 5:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-telles-murder-trial-verdict-jeff-german-las-vegas-rcna168400,"UPDATE (Aug. 29, 2024, 8:05 a.m. ET): Former Nevada politician Robert Telles was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday after he was found guilty of murdering local reporter Jeff German. Telles, 47, is eligible for parole after at least 20 years in prison. A Nevada jury has found Robert Telles, a former local politician, guilty of murdering an investigative journalist who was reporting on alleged mismanagement of Telles' office months before he was killed. Jurors convicted Telles of murder with use of deadly weapon on Wednesday, two days after deliberations began. As the verdict was read in court, Telles' gaze was lowered and he shook his head. The trial will move into the penalty phase later on Wednesday, when jurors may hear additional testimony to determine Telles' sentence. He faces up to life in prison. The verdict wraps a weekslong trial over Telles' role in the gruesome killing of veteran Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German in September 2022. A former Democratic administrator of a Clark County office that handles unclaimed estates, Telles had been at the center of German's investigation into allegations of bullying and hostility. German also reported on the then-politician's alleged romantic relationship with a female employee. Telles denied the allegations at the time. He subsequently lost his re-election bid in the Democratic primary, and he later singled out German for criticism on social media. Days after German was found dead with stab wounds in his home in September, Telles was arrested on suspicion of murder. During the trial, jurors heard emotional testimony from German's neighbors, as well as Telles' allegations on the stand of a bizarre conspiracy against him. Telles maintained his innocence throughout, claiming that his office co-workers, a real estate company, prosecutors and Las Vegas police were trying to “frame” him for fighting corruption. “I’m not crazy. I’m not trying to avoid responsibility,” Telles testified. “I didn’t kill Mr. German, and I’m innocent.” Prosecutors disputed those claims during the trial, telling the jury that they simply “didn’t make sense.” German’s own attorney, Robert Draskovich, did not side with him, though he said in closing arguments that his client’s belief in a conspiracy against him was “understandable.” “What other options does he have under these circumstances?” Draskovich asked."
'Super genius' economists say Trump budget is costlier than Harris plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-penn-wharton-economy-harris-rcna168687,"For what feels like the umpteenth time, experts are highlighting major aspects of Donald Trump’s economic policy that could hurt the economy and spike deficits. Two new reports from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model — part of the school Trump has attended and described as “super genius stuff” — found the GOP presidential nominee's economic proposals would increase the deficit nearly five times more than Vice President Kamala Harris' plans.  As CNBC explained: In contrast, here’s how CNBC summarized the Harris report: CNBC added the caveat that much of the revenue Harris hopes to generate with her economic plan requires congressional approval. But even with that caveat, the predictions are stark: Trump’s economic proposals would be all but certain to raise deficits dramatically — as he did when he was president — relative to Harris’ plans, which could cost about a fifth as much as his, according to the reports. Polls suggest most Americans feel the candidate most equipped to handle the economy isn’t always the candidate with the most salient economic plan. Trump’s plan has been panned several times now, despite his apparent polling strength on the issue.  The Penn reports follow a joint letter from 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists in June, who warned that Trump’s economic plan — particularly, his plan to deport immigrants en masse and impose 10% tariffs on all imports — would fuel inflation. And Moody’s Analytics came out with a report in June that reached a similar conclusion.  It's no wonder Trump and his campaign have worked so hard to undermine their movement’s faith in economic experts."
RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard have joined Trump's campaign. It could backfire.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-trump-gabbard-transition-harris-rcna168592,"Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard joined former President Donald Trump’s transition team this week. Trump’s campaign has framed the addition of Kennedy and Gabbard, who are both former Democrats, to its team as proof that Trump has assembled a “broad coalition” that has expanded “across partisan lines.” Kennedy and Gabbard don’t represent significant Democratic constituencies, however. They’re fringe, idiosyncratic political players who’ve long had supporters on the right. Trump's tent didn't necessarily get bigger; in fact, this is a potential narrowing of his coalition, as there’s a chance that, by bringing Gabbard and Kennedy under his wing, Trump alienates more voters than he wins over. It is standard — and savvy — for parties to point out that they appeal to people across the aisle. At the Democratic National Convention, Democrats attempted to make that case by inviting several Republicans to speak on the main stage, such as former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. Having people like Kinzinger speak about how they’ll be voting for Democrats and not Trump’s GOP is powerful because Kinzinger is still a Republican and during his time in office he was aligned with the Republican establishment. He was first elected during the tea party wave — endorsed by Republican former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — and as my colleague Steve Benen has pointed out, Kinzinger’s voting record in Congress was that of a traditional Republican partisan. His strident opposition to Trump, then, has the potential for credibility with certain sectors of the GOP. Kennedy and Gabbard, a former representative from Hawaii, aren’t analogous to Republicans like Kinzinger. Even when Gabbard was in the Democratic Party, her outlier positions on foreign policy made it an awkward fit. In office, Gabbard praised Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Syria strategy over former President Barack Obama’s, met personally with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and argued in favor of aligning with his brutal regime and insisted Democrats weren’t calling out Islamist terrorism clearly enough. She fared poorly in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, where her value add as a candidate was her idiosyncratic foreign policy views. In 2022, she announced she was leaving the party, and she immediately formed a warm relationship with Fox News. She has evolved into a vociferous critic of Democrats and long been seen as a friend of the MAGA right. Thus, her joining Trump doesn’t come as a shock.  Kennedy’s journey is different, but it similarly clashes with the Democratic Party establishment. Despite his surname and a history of working as an environmental lawyer, he has long been at odds with prevailing norms among Democrats, liberals and even mainstream conservatives with his noncredible activism against vaccines. During the Covid pandemic, he became a superspreader of misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and influenced Republican talking points with his online messaging. When he threw his hat in the ring in the Democratic presidential primaries in April 2023, he did, surprisingly, garner the interest of a surprisingly large percentage of Democrats, sometimes receiving the support of up to 20% of Democratic voters. But before it could be established what percentage of that support owed to Biden fatigue and his name’s being Kennedy, he dropped out of the primaries and launched an independent campaign. Most of his time as a presidential candidate in the public eye has been defined by his appearances in the right-wing media ecosystem. It’s no surprise that, since last year, polling has shown that Republicans hold a more favorable view of him than Democrats do. In other words, neither Kennedy nor Gabbard is well-positioned to sell the story of how the Democratic Party left them. While both of them are idiosyncratic and hold views that don’t fit into one ideological category, their most salient, reputation-defining views in recent years haven’t had a significant audience in the Democratic Party. For a long time they’ve been seen as not quite belonging to that party. Their defections to Trump not only make sense but have recently even seemed probable. Will Trump benefit from his newest transition team members? Gabbard has a small, energetic online following, but she’s currently more of a pundit than a politician and has been seen as an adversary of the Democratic establishment long enough that it’s hard to see her moving the dial in any significant way. Kennedy, on the other hand, was putting up significant numbers with his independent presidential campaign until last week, and the behavior of his following remains an open question. After Vice President Kamala Harris entered the White House race, Kennedy’s support declined to around 5% in three-way matchups among Harris, Trump and Kennedy. It seemed clear he was more of a threat to Trump’s vote share than Harris’. But it’s hard to predict how persuasive Kennedy will be in persuading his supporters to cast their ballots for Trump. It is plausible that a significant proportion of his remaining die-hard followers were disinclined to ever vote for either of the two major parties. It’s also plausible that much of his support was never going to materialize at the ballot box since his campaign hinged on the idea of mistrust of American institutions. Instead of winning more independents, there’s even a chance Trump takes a ding among such voters for Kennedy’s most extreme views and for lending credence to the Democrats’ seemingly effective attack that the GOP is hobbled by weirdness and creepiness. Kennedy constantly makes news for an unrelenting stream of outlandish conspiracy theories and bizarre personal tales. He has offensively and falsely claimed that Covid was ""targeted"" to spare Chinese people and Jews. He has told stories about worms eating his brain and about leaving a dead bear cub in Central Park. It has recently resurfaced that in a 2012 magazine story, his daughter said her father once found a dead whale on a beach in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, used a chain saw to sever its head and then tied it to the roof of his car and (potentially illegally) drove it home to New York. In light of Kennedy’s official role in helping form a potential Trump administration, and in light of reporting that Kennedy and Trump have discussed whether he’d have a position in one, Democrats can now pin Kennedy’s strangeness and extremism onto Trump. Trump might ultimately benefit at the margins from Kennedy’s dropping out and joining his campaign. All signs indicate that this will be an extremely tight race, and so even a small share of votes that might’ve otherwise gone to Kennedy in a swing state could be of help to Trump. But it’s far from a slam dunk. (One additional wrinkle: Kennedy won’t be able to remove his name from ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan, and that fact could theoretically hurt Trump in those states with people looking for a protest vote option.) Ultimately, Gabbard and Kennedy aren’t sirens for Democrats, and Kennedy’s extremely odd behavior could be a liability for Trump."
"Trump, while reflecting on assassination attempt, puts blame on Biden and Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-dr-phil-interview-assassination-attempt-biden-harris-rcna168617,"Donald Trump said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are at fault “to a certain extent” for the attempt on his life last month in Pennsylvania, blaming them for security deficiencies even though the president and vice president have no involvement in Secret Service assignments. “He always made it very tough for us to have the proper number of Secret Service people,” Trump said about Biden in an interview with TV personality Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil. “When this happened, people would ask, whose fault is it? I think to a certain extent it’s Biden’s fault and Harris’ fault,” Trump added in the interview, which aired Tuesday. “And I’m the opponent. Look, they were weaponizing government against me, they brought in the whole DOJ to try and get me, they weren’t too interested in my health and safety.” Trump’s claim is entirely unfounded. The president and vice president are not involved in Secret Service assignments. The agency, which is funded by Congress, has faced a staffing shortage for years, as NBC News recently reported. A Secret Service official told NBC News that the shortfall has resulted in denials of requests for extra personnel for Trump over the past two years, but added that no such requests had been turned down for the rally where he was shot. On Wednesday, FBI officials told reporters that Trump’s would-be assassin had searched online for information about both of the major parties’ national conventions and that the former president’s July 13 rally in Pennsylvania appears to have been a “target of opportunity.” Trump’s comments escalate the tension in an already heated election year. Republicans have blamed the shooting on Democrats for calling Trump a threat to democracy after he has repeatedly vowed to tear through political norms and governmental systems of checks and balances. Analysts and experts have said that the surge of violent threats against election officials is in part motivated by Trump’s own vengeful rhetoric toward those he perceives as enemies. In the interview, Trump spoke at length about the rally shooting. McGraw also appeared to egg him on, asking: “I’m not saying that they [Biden and Harris] wanted you to get shot, but do you think it was OK with them if you did?” “I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know,” Trump responded. “There’s a lot of hatred. I don’t know why. I had a great presidency.” At one point, the former president suggested that he may have survived the shooting because God wants him to save the world. “If I win that [the election], that would really serve to say that there’s some incredible power up there that wanted me to be involved — and maybe it’s more than saving the nation, maybe it’s saving the world,” Trump said."
Trump is borrowing an old GOP tactic on abortion — with one key difference,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-reproductive-rights-truth-social-abortion-rcna168309,"On Friday, Donald Trump declared that his administration would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” The Truth Social post immediately drew the ire of anti-abortion leaders and the mockery of commentators supportive of abortion rights, who noted that in an interview the day before, Trump had also repeated his now familiar (and false) line that all Americans wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. Trump is trying to have it both ways. And while this strategy may not exactly be working at the moment, history can help us understand his bigger goal — and whether it will work in the longer term. Clearly, Trump and many in the GOP are aware that the reversal of Roe remains unpopular. And Republicans’ attempts to appear more moderate may seem novel, given how recently politicians like JD Vance boasted about their pro-life bona fides. But in reality, just a few decades ago mainstream Republicans were already trying hard to appease both sides of the debate. Ronald Reagan was the first GOP presidential nominee to fully embrace the anti-abortion movement, believing not that most Americans opposed legal abortion but that his position could help the GOP win over socially conservative Catholics and Democrats who might have voted Democratic for economic reasons. In 1976, the GOP platform adopted at the Republican National Convention had taken a muddy position on abortion; in 1980, Reagan ran on a platform that embraced an amendment to the Constitution to protect fetal rights. But by the late 1980s and early 1990s, GOP leaders were having second thoughts. Lee Atwater, George H.W. Bush’s campaign manager, often stated publicly that anti-abortion positions were unpopular and stressed that the GOP was a “big tent” that could accommodate those with a range of positions on reproductive rights. With Atwater’s encouragement, Ann Stone, the ex-wife of Trumpworld insider Roger Stone, launched Republicans for Choice in 1990 to organize these efforts. This move was blunted by the success of firebrand Pat Buchanan during the 1992 GOP primary, however. Buchanan fared better than expected in several key contests, winning himself a prime slot at the GOP national convention, where he railed against abortion and women working outside the home. Republicans had considered changing their platform at the 1992 Republican National Convention to leave out demands for a fetal personhood amendment. But Bush ultimately veered back to the right on the issue. The whiplash continued. After autopsies of the race established that the abortion issue had hurt George H.W. Bush, the effort to make the GOP a “big tent” regained momentum. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader and GOP standard bearer in 1996, wanted to push a more moderate line. He called on his party to condemn a specific procedure performed in the second trimester that abortion opponents called “partial-birth abortion.” At the same time, Dole promoted a pledge of tolerance welcoming those into the GOP with a wide variety of views on personhood, especially those who considered themselves pro-choice. But Dole lost that November to President Bill Clinton, and abortion opponents argued that his position on abortion had watered down the enthusiasm of his own base. President George W. Bush won two elections at a time when abortion rights seemed secure. His father, by contrast, lost an election at precisely the time many Americans had first expected Roe to be overturned. By that point, Reagan and the elder Bush — both of whom had called for the reversal of Roe — had nominated a majority of the justices then on the Supreme Court. And more tellingly, in 1989, the Supreme Court had issued a major decision openly criticizing Roe. This election season, Trump has borrowed from strategies that the GOP once used to undercut Democrats’ advantage on abortion. Like his predecessors, Trump and other Republicans have spotlighted abortions later in pregnancy, presuming them to be more unpopular. The 2024 GOP platform omitted any mention of a fetal-personhood constitutional amendment and praised IVF. And as mentioned earlier, Trump himself has used the language of “reproductive rights,” suggesting that he, too, wants to build a big tent. But look closer, and it is clear that Trump is doing something different. Advocates like Atwater or Stone might generally have supported some abortion rights — or felt the need to change the GOP’s position to remain electorally relevant. (Welcoming pro-abortion voters into the tent, in theory, would necessitate a political pivot.) With Trump, it’s far less clear that this is the case. After all, Trump never defined what he meant by “reproductive rights,” and has claimed baselessly that Americans never wanted a right to abortion in the first place. This despite polls dating back to before Roe’s reversal show that more than half of Americans did not want it to be reversed. It certainly seems possible that Trump’s definition of reproductive rights could actually exclude the right to an abortion. This confusion is par for the course with Trump. His platform, for example, nodded to the theory that the Fourteenth Amendment already recognized fetal personhood, and members of the platform committee insisted that it was for this reason that there was no longer a need to mention a specific personhood amendment. Trump has said that he supports the Supreme Court’s recent ruling preserving access to the abortion pill mifepristone yet also suggested that he was open to prohibiting mifepristone access. And recently, when stating that he would not enforce the Comstock Act, a nineteenth-century obscenity law some conservatives would love used to ban abortion, Trump made clear that the specifics had yet to be worked out, and that his commitment not to enforce the law, such as it was, applied only “generally.” The upshot, it seems, is that Trump wants both anti-abortion voters and supporters of abortion rights to vote for him without offering either one much of anything. Trump’s obfuscation has angered anti-abortion leaders with reason — it suggests that he has taken their voters for granted. And Trump has embraced talk of reproductive rights while reiterating how happy he is that the Supreme Court overturned the biggest safeguard to those rights. Trump is not the first Republican to try to walk a fine line on abortion. But he may be the first GOP presidential candidate to try to totally redefine the concept of reproductive rights in a bid to soften his rhetoric without having to actually soften any of his policy stances."

While litigation continues over the unusual matter, a federal judge has given Shkreli, who left prison in 2022, until Friday to “sequester and turn over all of his copies, in any form, of the Album or its contents to defense counsel” and to file an affidavit swearing under penalty of perjury that he has done so and that he no longer possesses any copies, in any form, of the album or its contents. U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen’s preliminary injunction order on Monday further requires his counsel to file a letter by Friday certifying that they’ve taken possession of the album copies and contents. The judge also ordered Shkreli to file, by Sept. 30, an inventory and account in the form of an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that includes: the nature and volume of the copies of the album’s data and files that he retained; the names and contact information of anyone to whom he distributed the data and files; when and how he distributed them; and the amounts, source, date and nature of any financial benefits he received from his distribution or playing of the album or its contents. After hearing legal arguments from the parties, Chen, sitting in the Eastern District of New York, said that a preliminary injunction was in the public interest and that the plaintiff had raised sufficiently serious questions about Shkreli’s possible violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, misappropriation of trade secrets and unjust enrichment. Shrekli’s lawyers had argued that the plaintiff couldn’t show sufficient harm to warrant an injunction. They wrote in a filing last month that the government The judge further warned Shkreli that any violation of her order can be prosecuted as contempt of court.

Colorado man arrested after allegedly making threats against judges and election officials,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 2:26 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/colorado-man-death-threats-judges-election-officials-rcna168666,"On Monday, federal authorities announced the arrest of a Colorado man for allegedly lobbing death threats at election officials, judges and federal agents, largely using social media platforms known as hotbeds for right-wing extremism. The arrest of 45-year-old Teak Brockbank is the latest in a disturbing trend of violent threats targeting election officials and other people framed as enemies by the vindictive MAGA ecosystem. A DOJ press release summarizes the claims: An affidavit shows authorities’ concerns stemmed from statements Brockbank allegedly made via text messages and posts on two Trump-friendly social media sites: Gab and the JD Vance-backed video platform Rumble. The names of the officials targeted in the posts were sealed at the request of the government. Brockbank's threats allegedly began in 2021, when Trump and his failed presidential campaign directed the movement’s vitriol toward the U.S. election system. In one comment on Rumble in 2021, Brockbank allegedly called a Colorado judge a “communist,” claiming he’d be “justified” if he were to “put a bullet in this Mans head and send him to explain himself to our Creator right now.” That comment also made reference to “where we go one, we go all,” a phrase propagated by Trump-loving QAnon conspiracy theorists. In July 2021, the same Rumble account posted that ""there is no other way to fix this mess in Colorado and Arizona without executing these evil people,"" going on to refer to election officials. In a Gab post from September 2021, Brockbank allegedly said that an election official “needs to- No has to Hang she has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.” That same account repeated calls for hangings in “Communist Colorado,” claiming “we will have to do it ourselves!” And in August 2022, the Rumble account responded to a user who urged “taking” the country back with more death threats directed at another official. “Once those people start getting put to death then the rest will melt like snowflakes and turn on each other and we will just sit back,” the account said, adding that “those of us that have the stomach for what has to be done should prepare our minds for what we all ARE going to do!!!!!!” The affidavit also refers to a text message Brockbank allegedly sent his stepfather in 2023: “Four judges in Colorado have removed President Trump from the ballot in Colorado” and “their names have been moved to the front of my list.”  The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately overruled the Colorado state Supreme Court's ruling that Trump was ineligible to appear on the state's ballot, but not before the ruling resulted in a wave of violent right-wing threats that caught the eye of federal law enforcement.  What else should we expect from a conservative movement that continues to lionize those who engage in political violence?"
Project 2025 would enable Donald Trump's worst instincts as commander in chief,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 2:18 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/donald-trump-veterans-military-project-2025-rcna168665,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 27 episode of ""The ReidOut."" Now that Donald Trump is trying to get elected again, he’s pretending to care about America’s military service members and veterans — or at least trying to get you to forget all the ways he’s denigrated them.  This weekend marked six years since Vietnam War hero Sen. John McCain died. It also marks six years since Trump had to be shamed into releasing a formal statement on the senator’s passing. Trump’s pettiness in the wake of McCain’s death is just one example of his pattern of disrespect for America’s military. He has reportedly called fallen soldiers “losers and suckers” and told aides he didn’t want to see disabled veterans at events. He recently said the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest presidential civilian award, is better since recipients of the Medal of Honor, the highest military award, are either dead or have combat wounds. He’s also denigrated the generals who’ve served under him, suggesting the execution of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and calling his former White House chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly “stupid.” Now, another general who served under Trump, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster,  is giving his inside account of the former president's chaos. In a new book, McMaster writes about how Russian dictator Vladimir Putin manipulated Trump by playing to his “ego and insecurities with flattery.” McMaster also says Trump set the stage for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 by entering into negotiations with the Taliban. Trump's threats to our country's military aren't just in the past. If he wins a second term, Trump has expansive and draconian plans for the military. He’s already plotting to fire top military leaders who don’t share his vision — an idea straight out of Project 2025: Firing top officers is one of many ways Project 2025 seeks to rebuild a military it refers to as “Barack Obama’s general officer corps.” In addition to calling for firing and freezing promotions for generals, Project 2025 also wants to rebuild and retrain the military. It would require all public schools to administer the military entrance exam for recruitment. The document also calls for the reinstatement of active-duty members who refused Covid vaccines and restoring their rank. Project 2025 pushes for abolishing diversity, equity and inclusion offices and staff — ostensibly to make the military whiter and reduce women’s roles. It also calls to expand support for the Department of Homeland Security’s border protection operations. In plain English, that means deputizing the military to round up migrants.  It’s clear Project 2025 would enable Trump’s worst instincts when it comes to his role as commander in chief. The prospect of handing the reins of our military back over to him should terrify us all.

"RFK Jr., who has endorsed Trump for president, must stay on the ballot in two swing states",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 1:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-michigan-wisconsin-ballot-trump-swing-states-rcna168680,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not be able to remove his name from the ballots in Wisconsin and in Michigan, two crucial battleground states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hoping will deliver them a decisive win in November. Kennedy suspended his independent bid for president last week and promptly endorsed Trump. Polls had shown that Kennedy was more likely to gain support among Republicans than among Democrats, and the suspension of his presidential campaign was seen as more beneficial to Trump than to Harris. In remarks to his supporters on Friday, Kennedy said he was not formally ending his campaign and that he intends to remain on the ballot in states where he poses little to no threat of splitting the vote with the GOP nominee. But in Michigan and Wisconsin, where polls have been running close, Kennedy has now been barred from removing himself from ballots. In Michigan, where Kennedy was nominated as the Natural Law Party's candidate, a spokesperson for the secretary of state's office told NBC News that minor-party candidates cannot withdraw their nominations. The Wisconsin Election Commission on Tuesday also declined Kennedy's request to take his name off the ballot; Ann Jacobs, who chairs the commission, said that state law does not permit a qualified candidate who has filed nomination papers to decline nomination, NBC News reported. Still, Kennedy's insistence on remaining on ballots in non-swing states may speak to a need to prove that his candidacy, no matter how little it is resonating, has appeal. Days after Kennedy suspended his campaign, Kentucky's secretary of state said he had filed on Monday to run for president in the state and will appear on the ballot in November."
How Obama’s biggest ‘controversy’ became Harris’ greatest opportunity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 1:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-tan-suit-vs-obama-tan-suit-rcna168627,"Ten years ago, President Barack Obama appeared at a press conference wearing a pale khaki suit and a gray, striped tie. The outfit choice prompted a slew of outraged headlines, particularly from Republicans. Then-New York Congressman Peter T. King contended that the choice was “unpresidential” and that it pointed to Obama’s “lack of seriousness.” On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris stepped onto the stage in a flared-leg tan suit designed by Chloé creative director Chemena Kamali. Harris paired the suit with a cream crepe de chine lavallière blouse, also by Chloé, and high-shine pointed-toe pumps. A similar double-breasted version of Harris’ jacket is available on Chloé’s website. The color listed below its steep price tag is fittingly and, given the tenor of the Harris’ campaign, unsurprisingly called coconut brown. The internet was quick to draw parallels between the two outfits. Many X users posited that Harris was deliberately evoking Obama’s tan suit, subtly trolling Republican pundits. Responses to a post made by MSNBC’s “The Weekend” Executive Producer Kyle Griffin included “troll game strong” and “I yelled and then had to explain to my kid why the tan suit was an expert level choice for her.” While the Harris-Walz campaign is quick to embrace all Obama-era commentary and has proven its internet fluency, this fashion moment was Harris’ alone. Harris’ campaign outfits are a sign of a new era of political dressing. Her campaign wardrobe, from the now iconic Chloé suit to her brightly colored tailored separates with pared down Chucks, is not representative of the bygone 2010s “Lean In” girlboss dressing or 1980s suiting as a means to battle in-office sexism. No, Harris’ outfits exist wholly in the context of today. The year 1992, dubbed “the year of the woman” for electing four women to the Senate, led to a significant moment for women’s suiting. The following year, then-Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski became the first woman to wear a pantsuit on the Senate floor when she and then-Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum launched a subdued but effective protest: They wore pants and told female staffers to do the same. In the years after, the pantsuit became the accepted and almost compulsory apparel for women in Washington, including for Hillary Clinton. Donning pants instead of skirts is historically revolutionary. Selecting clothing that exists outside of what is attractive to a patriarchal society is a weapon that women have used to protect themselves for generations, as a means to demand respect and safety. A contemporary, more grim, version of this can be seen in a viral TikTok trend showing young women covering their fashionable miniskirts with baggy t-shirts on the New York subway. Being a woman on public transportation, on Capitol Hill, in court rooms, on Wall Street and in newsrooms has until very recently been viewed a detriment. And while clothing, of course, neither protects you nor precludes you from sexual harassment or assault, the way you dress is a vehicle for respect, power and self-confidence. In the aftermath of #MeToo, standing on the shoulders of women trailblazers, traditionally male silhouettes are no longer required. Today, two things exist at once: womanhood and power. Harris’ Chloé suit set the tone for the rest of DNC and for the rest of her campaign. In wearing her  suits and not, say, a more conventional navy, knee-length skirt, Harris is signaling that she is unafraid to carve her own path forward. (As the first Black and Indian American woman on the ticket, this is impossible anyway.) In this way, this suit — a modern spin on traditionally accepted political women’s wear — mirrors her candidacy. Harris is demanding respect in her own way. Perhaps the most radical and revolutionary of all: Harris looks pretty. She looks presidential. Suits, although awash on the DNC stage, have little practical space in a contemporary woman’s wardrobe, except as subversive. It is chic and popular, in perpetuity, to wear a deconstructed suit to a formal event à la Bianca Jagger’s seminal Yves Saint Laurent wedding outfit. With more employees working from home, very few workplaces require the sort of formality that Washington still does. The suit has mostly been replaced with so-called power dressing: shoulder pads, oversized blazers, slouchy boyfriend-without-the-boyfriend jeans. Clothing that skews more gender neutral is not just trendy, but it is also mainstream. Once again, Harris has proved incredibly adroit at reading and tapping into the zeitgeist. Chloé and boho chic are experiencing a resurgence. A few weeks ago, Sydney Sweeney wore head-to-toe Chloé in black thigh-high leather boots, a cream-colored mini dress and capelet. Daisy Edgar-Jones spent much of her ""Twisters"" press tour in Chloé, including a stunning sky blue, sheer ruffled maxi dress. And Harris, having publicly worn the French brand at least three times, is now listed in their ranks. In 2008, one of the campaign slogans Obama ran on was “change we can believe.” Then, Americans were craving something different, something outside the beltway. His tan colored suit signaled that he was going to do things his way. It signaled that he was that change. Ten years later, Americans still want change they can believe in. Despite her policies, her record, her personal beliefs, Harris, as a powerful Black and Indian woman, will never be inside the beltway. Indeed, Harris’ fashion choices will be picked apart and analyzed in ways Barack Obama could never even fathom. She may as well wear a tan suit."
Supreme Court rejects Biden administration bid to allow student loan relief,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 12:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-student-loan-relief-biden-rcna168671,"The Supreme Court declined to reinstate the Biden administration’s latest student loan relief program, keeping a lower court’s sweeping injunction in place while litigation continues, raising further uncertainty for borrowers. In an unsigned order Wednesday, without any justices noting their disagreement, the high court rejected the federal government’s application to vacate the injunction, which the government told the justices “has scrambled the Department’s administration of loans for millions of borrowers.” The order said that the court “expects that the Court of Appeals will render its decision with appropriate dispatch,” referring to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued the injunction during litigation over the legality of the effort. The case could return to the justices after the circuit court rules on the merits of the issue. The move follows the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority striking down a previous Biden administration loan relief effort last year. The latest one at issue here is known as the SAVE plan, an income-driven repayment effort that, like last year’s case, was challenged by Republican-led states who sued to block the Biden administration plan. Wednesday’s order marks the justices’ latest emergency ruling this summer ahead of their next term beginning in October.

"As the GOP targets Harris’ border wall stance, the details matter",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 11:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-targets-harris-border-wall-stance-details-matter-rcna168652,"Sen. JD Vance, the Republican Party’s vice presidential nominee, mocked the idea this week that Vice President Kamala Harris “wants to build the border wall.” Hours later, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on Fox News and told viewers, “Graham: Do you really believe she’s going to build a wall? That’s just bulls---.” As for what prompted the partisan pushback, it apparently stems from a report Axios published. The headline read, “Harris flip-flops on building the border wall,” and the article began: A typical person reading this might believe that the Democratic presidential hopeful recently endorsed investing in a border wall, but that’s not quite what happened. Let’s take a brief stroll down memory lane. As regular readers might recall, it was last fall when congressional Republicans said they were so desperate to deal with U.S./Mexico border policies that they took a radical step: GOP officials said that unless Democrats agreed to a series of conservative reforms, Republicans were prepared to cut off military aid to Ukraine and let Russia take part of Eastern Europe by force. Democrats, left with little choice, agreed to pay the GOP’s ransom and endorsed a conservative, bipartisan compromise. At that point, Republicans killed the compromise plan they’d demanded — largely because Donald Trump told them to. Making matters worse, the calculus was electoral, not substantive: The former president didn’t want Congress to hand President Joe Biden an election-year victory on one of the party’s top priorities. Republicans followed Trump’s lead and concluded that they’d rather have a campaign issue than a solution. What does this have to do with allegations of Harris “flip-flopping”? The bipartisan compromise, which featured concessions from both parties, included some wall funding in the hopes of generating GOP support. It was a relatively modest sum — $650 million, roughly 3% of what the Trump administration sought in 2018 — and the funding wasn’t even new. (As Team Harris reminded Axios, the provision “just extended the timeline to spend funds that had been appropriated during Trump’s last year as president.”) The vice president has never been a wall advocate — in fact, she’s been a fierce critic of Trump’s plan — but she endorsed the Senate agreement in the hopes of getting something done on the issue. Six months after Republicans killed the deal they requested, using Harris' convention speech as a news hook, Axios summarized this in bullet-point form, at which point the right effectively declared, “A ha!” As lines of attack go, this is weak tea. If the Democratic nominee were to actually endorse the merits of a border wall, that would be a dramatic reversal worthy of attention. But her willingness to back a bipartisan compromise — which included provisions she and her party would not support on their own — does not a “flip-flop” make."
Sarah Palin wins new trial against New York Times in defamation case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 10:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/sarah-palin-new-york-times-defamation-appeal-rcna168606,"Former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin won a new defamation trial against the New York Times on Wednesday, with a federal appeals court panel citing multiple legal errors in the case. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rebuked the trial judge (though it didn’t remove him) in reviving Palin’s lawsuit against the paper and its former opinion editor James Bennett. The New York-based appellate panel highlighted “several major issues” at the trial presided over by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, specifically “the erroneous exclusion of evidence, an inaccurate jury instruction, a legally erroneous response to a mid-deliberation jury question, and jurors learning during deliberations of the district court’s Rule 50 dismissal ruling.” The Times said in a statement after the ruling, “This decision is disappointing. We’re confident we will prevail in a retrial.” The suit stemmed from a 2017 Times editorial called “America’s Lethal Politics,” which compared two political shootings: the 2011 killing of six people and the injury of 13 others in Arizona, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat; and the 2017 Virginia shooting that seriously injured four people, including Rep. Stephen Scalise, R-La., at a congressional baseball game practice. The Times editorial argued there was a clear and direct link between the Arizona shooting and the political incitement arising from a digital graphic published in March 2010 by Palin’s political action committee. The graphic was a map that superimposed crosshairs over 20 congressional districts represented by Democrats, including Giffords’.  But a relationship between the crosshairs map and the shooting “was never established,” the circuit panel wrote, adding that the incident was rather “viewed as a tragic result” of the shooter’s serious mental illness. (A correction on the editorial currently reads: “An editorial on Thursday about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs.”) Wednesday’s ruling for Palin is the latest appellate outing in her favor. In 2019, the circuit previously reversed the trial court’s dismissal of the case. This latest ruling stems from the 2022 trial.  During jury deliberations, the judge decided that he sided with the defense and would render what’s known as judgment as a matter of law (the Rule 50 dismissal to which the appeals court referred). The judge said that he would dismiss the case only after the jury had returned its verdict but wouldn’t tell the jury about his decision so as not to interfere with the verdict.  The jury found the defense not liable, but it turned out that several jurors had learned about the judge’s ruling before they reached their verdict, from push notifications on their phones.  On appeal, Palin challenged both the verdict and the Rule 50 decision, and the circuit court agreed that both must be vacated.  “Given a judge’s special position of influence with a jury, we think a jury’s verdict reached with the knowledge of the judge’s already-announced disposition of the case will rarely be untainted, no matter what the jurors say upon subsequent inquiry,” the panel wrote in its decision, authored by Judge John Walker, an appointee (and cousin) of former President George H.W. Bush. He was joined by George W. Bush appointee Reena Raggi and Donald Trump appointee Richard Sullivan. But the panel declined to reassign the case to a new judge — a subject that is also top of mind in special counsel Jack Smith’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case. “On remand, we are confident that the district judge will adhere to the principle of complete impartiality, and its appearance, in fulfilling his future judicial responsibilities in this case,” Walker wrote of the Clinton-appointed judge.

All live on stage. All in one day.   Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi everyone. It is the morning of Wednesday, August 28th. Welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is actually the 100th episode as for those listeners who just heard us yesterday -- Mary McCord: Yesterday. Andrew Weissmann: -- talking about our 99th episode thinking that we were going to be recording next week our 100th episode. Well, we’re doing an emergency episode in light of the fact that there was a superseding indictment handed down by a D.C. grand jury yesterday. So we wanted to talk about that quickly. And before we forget, in case anyone doesn’t know, I’m Andrew Weissman. I’m the co-host of “Prosecuting Donald Trump” and I’m here with my wonderful co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: Hi. Okay, let’s get started. So, Mary, gee, what’s on our dance card? Mary McCord: Yeah, that’s right. That is all we’re talking about. This is going to be a shorter episode than usual, but we just thought it was so important in light of the fact that there is this new indictment. And this indictment was presented to a new grand jury, not the same grand jury that had returned the original indictment. And we’ll talk about why that was. Jack Smith even told the court that it was bringing this new indictment to reflect the government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States. That is the immunity decision. And so that is what Jack Smith’s team has been doing ever since that decision got handed down and listeners will know that this Friday, both Jack Smith’s team and Mr. Trump’s team are due to provide to Judge Chutkan in D.C. where this superseding indictment was returned a proposal for how to go forward with pretrial proceedings. So obviously, if this new indictment was to affect that, which it will, they needed to get it returned before this Friday. It explains some of that delay, though, and the reasons for delay and asking for more time to file things in front of the court, I think. So let’s break down what’s different about it, but first, you know, some level setting on that opinion just to remind listeners, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So one question I have gotten repeatedly is people saying, well, why didn’t they ask, since it’s a new indictment, for this to get to a different judge? Remember, this is, as Mary said, this is the D.C. case. This is not the Florida case where that would be a logical question, which is, like how do you get out of Judge Cannon’s courtroom? This is in front of Judge Chutkan, who has been a very good judge by all accounts for both sides. So to answer Mary’s question, let’s level set, what is the Supreme Court immunity decision in brief that this indictment responds to? Remember that that decision said that for core presidential functions defined very broadly to include interactions between the president and his or her Department of Justice, core functions are absolutely immune. Not a balancing, nothing like that, absolutely immune. So the part of the indictment that would be out are the allegations about Donald Trump’s pressuring interactions with the Department of Justice to get them to say that there was some kind of fraud investigation going on, even a sham investigation. That’s point one. Point two is they said even with respect to other official acts that were undertaken by the president outside of the core functions, for those other official acts, and again, potentially defined broadly, although they didn’t set the exact scope, they are at least presumptively immune. They didn’t decide whether they were absolutely immune. They left that to another day, but they said, for our purposes, they were at least presumptively immune, and that could be rebutted by the department. The test that they set out was quite strict, but that sort of gets too much in the weeds. But that’s the basic parameters of what Jack Smith was dealing with. And thus we have this superseding indictment, and Mary, I know that you have done a lot in the last few hours -- Mary McCord: Twelve hours. Andrew Weissmann: -- that we’ve had to talk about what’s deleted and what’s added because since a lot of commentators have talked about what’s deleted, but that’s only half of the equation. There’s deletions and additions. So Mary, let me turn it over to you. Mary McCord: Sure. Yes. And like you said, this is all about Jack Smith trying to come into conformity with that decision and to be able to for even things that, well, be able to show two things. One, what we’re charging here is not even official acts. And then even if it is, we can rebut this presumption by showing that criminal prosecution for these particular acts would not cause any danger to the authority and functions of the presidency. And that’s why they’ve now parsed this and they’ve done it directly in response to the Supreme Court. And as you indicated, because the Supreme Court said that the president’s interactions with his own Department of Justice and executive branch officials, including White House advisors, is core presidential functions and absolutely immune, that is all eliminated from the superseding indictment. So, Jeffrey Clark, who was a Department of Justice high level official there, who was ready to expand upon Trump’s false claims of election fraud and pressure states to open investigations and things like that, Jeffrey Clark’s not even listed as a co-conspirator. The indictment makes clear that all other co-conspirators were acting in their private capacity, and none of them were government officials. It eliminates all allegations of discussions with all Department of Justice officials, all executive branch officials, including the entire section on the defendant’s attempt to leverage the Department of Justice to use deceit to get state officials to replace legitimate electors and electoral votes with the defendants. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what you were saying about Jeffrey Clark is a really good example of deletion and addition. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: Because there’s deletion, there used to be six unindicted co-conspirators, one of them was widely believed to be Jeffrey Clark. There are now five. And an example of deletion is taking out all the stuff about Jeffrey Clark and, as you said, the Department of Justice. But the addition is that with respect to the five unindicted co-conspirators that remain, the superseding indictment is very clear that they are private counsel. Mary McCord: That’s true. Andrew Weissmann: These are private actors. In other words, there’s lots of language about the president acting in his capacity as a candidate or as a private person. Mary McCord: Now you’re getting to my part, Andrew. This is my part. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, but the idea is that there’s very much this sort of subtraction and addition. Mary McCord: That’s right. And that’s why I made the point that as for the other co-conspirators, the indictment’s clear. They were private attorneys, private political advisors. Another thing eliminated is conversations with the vice president about just election fraud generally, and instead what is included in the indictment, again, so that’s the elimination. And what is added in the indictment is just not added, but what remains in the indictment with respect to the conversations that Trump had with Vice President Pence are those that focus on Trump’s attempts to remain in power, to pressure Mike Pence not to count the legitimate electoral votes from the swing states and instead count the fraudulent slates of electors. So they’ve taken out anything where Trump is suggesting there was fraud and here’s why we know it and we should investigate it and they leave just the things about him remaining in power. It eliminates similarly tweets and public statements that are about election fraud, but leaves in tweets and public statements that falsely claimed the vice president could reject legitimate electors. And again, in another edition explains that Trump used Twitter sometimes to communicate with the public as president, those would be things that the Supreme Court called official acts, but also regularly used it for personal purposes. So in each one of these eliminations, they’re taking out something that the Supreme Court has indicated would be within the scope of an official act, and then they’re either adding or emphasizing why what they left in is not official act or at least could rebut the presumption. On other additions that are just flat out additions, and I think these are important go to the point you were just making about a candidate. One of the things the Supreme Court pointed out is there’s a difference between the President acting as President, right, within the functions and authority of a President, which is a likely, according to the Supreme Court, mean that those things are official acts and the President functioning in his personal capacity or as a candidate. So the new indictment adds in many different places, Trump’s role here was as a candidate. And in fact, it even emphasizes that Trump had filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit. This is in December of 2020, a lawsuit brought by a state attorneys general that had sought to invalidate the results of the election in Pennsylvania and some of the other swing states. Trump specifically, when he moved through his attorneys to intervene in that lawsuit, his legal filing said he was doing this in his role as a candidate, right? So in your role as a candidate, can’t be an official act. The indictment also, every time it refers to the January 6th speech on the ellipsis, it calls it Trump’s campaign speech. And at one point explains that’s a speech that was privately funded and privately organized, again, can’t be presidential and official if it’s privately funded and organized and it’s a campaign speech. And the other thing it always does is referred to the vice president when he is exercising that role to count the Electoral College votes on January 6th, preside over the joint session of Congress, always adds the phrase, vice president as presiding on January 6th as president of the Senate. So that is not his executive branch role as a vice president and advisor to Trump. It is his role under Article 1 of the Constitution as president of the Senate. So again, not an official act. Also adds that Trump had no official responsibility related to certification, but did have a personal interest as a candidate. And finally adds in multiple places that also Trump had no official responsibilities relating to the convening of legitimate electors or their signing or mailing in of the certificates of vote. So it’s trying to differentiate things that are in his official role as president and things that are in his personal capacity or that he has no official responsibility for. Andrew Weissmann: One of the notes that’s fascinating in a little civics lesson is that the vice presidency is a unique role -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- in our constitutional firmament because the vice president is a part of the executive branch. However, when the vice president is acting to certify the votes, acts, and also can be a tiebreaker, the vice president is also part of the legislative branch. Mary McCord: That’s Article 1, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So that’s sort of exactly what you’re referring to, Article 1 versus Article 2. Article 1 is legislative. Article 2 is executive and that’s referring to the articles within the Constitution of the United States. So the vice president, very unusual -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- role to be in both, because usually it’s you’re either fish or fowl. You’re not fish and fowl, but he is. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So let’s take a quick break, and then we can talk about sort of what this means. So what’s the effect and why we think he did this? Mary McCord: Absolutely. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. So now that we’ve kind of gone through the eliminations and the additions in the superseding indictment, we’re going to get a little bit into why Jack Smith made these calls and how effective we think this new strategy will be. Let’s start with you, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So I think one of the things that I think people should focus on is sort of the actual effect of the Supreme Court decision on a trial if it were to occur, which is only going to ever happen if just to be clear, if Kamala Harris is actually elected. If Donald Trump is elected, the whole case goes away. So it’s sort of irrelevant. And very much for our listeners who have looked at and followed us with respect to what’s happening in the Manhattan case, where there’s this pending motion having to do with the use of official act evidence, even in a case involving unofficial charges. Here, the whole idea is to try and sanitize the upcoming trial of allegations that are official act evidences to which that cannot be rebutted. So there’s going to be litigation over this. But let me just talk about very specifically what I think is lost, at least in the indictment stage. And that is one of the things that the initial indictment did very well is to support the idea that Donald Trump knew that what he was doing was fraudulent, that he knew he had lost the election. There was a whole litany of people who told him that. And that is very much curtailed because, as you said, Mary, the allegations having to do with people at the Department of Justice, executive branch people speaking to Donald Trump as president, for instance, CISA that looks at it as sort of election fraud and election security within the Department of Homeland Security, those kinds of allegations are removed. And so that litany, it’s not that it doesn’t exist at all. It’s that the primary function comes from either state people saying that or campaign people telling Donald Trump that. So there still is evidence to show that, if proved, that Donald Trump knew that it was fraudulent. But the panoply is curbed because of the Supreme Court decision. Mary McCord: Yeah, and I think, you know, that again comes back to the fact that what the Supreme Court said was within core constitutional responsibilities of the president is his leadership of his own executive branch. So all of, you know, his acting attorney general, acting deputy attorney general telling him there was no fraud significant enough to change the outcome and there’s no basis for investigation, that’s out. But the four charges are the same as they were originally. There’s first the conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, and that is to defeat the federal governmental function through dishonesty, fraud, and deceit. And those include all of the schemes to prevent the actual legitimate counting of the electoral ballots on January 6th. The second is a conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, that official proceeding being the January 6th joint session of Congress to count the Electoral College ballots. There’s also a direct charge of obstruction of official proceeding. And these are things we can talk about in a future episode about how those survive the Fischer case, the other case about obstruction that had to do with the rioters. And then finally, there’s a charge of conspiracy to violate civil rights, that meaning people’s rights to vote and have their votes counted. So all of these conspiracies do require knowledge, right? Knowledge of the fact that there really was no serious election fraud and knowledge that what the president was saying was false. But what does remain, Andrew, and I think it is in here powerfully, is the fact that state officials, right, Secretary of State in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the leadership of the state legislature in Arizona, they were telling the president very directly, Mr. President, we have looked, we have done audits, we have done recounts, we have examined this, there is no significant fraud in our states. So it is still there, but it is curtailed, as you said. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, and also internal campaign people telling him, because again, that would not be official conduct that would be as a candidate -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- to get back to your point at the outset. So the question arises is, why do this? Why now? So I think there are a number of reasons why you would do this. One, it creates a very clean look. In other words, there’s so much that’s sort of added and subtracted that it’s not like you can just tell the court, oh, you know, where we’re not relying on allegations in paragraphs seven and 12. There’s a lot here. And so sending a very, very detailed letter, it’s so much that it’s sort of a much cleaner canvas to work off of because everybody knows what’s in and what’s out because it’s there. That’s sort of one. The other more substantive reason is that to extend that Donald Trump was going to make claims in the district court and up to and including the Supreme Court, that the grand jury process was tainted by the introduction of evidence and conduct that is immunized, and the grand jury shouldn’t have considered it, this takes that off the table. So from a defensive point of view, it’s basically we don’t need to litigate that. It is easy enough to go back to the grand jury and pointedly, as you pointed out at the very outset, Jack Smith made a point of telling the court this is a new grand jury. And so they could be given, it could be sanitized evidence. They also could be told exactly what the law is, because the law has now changed dramatically. So it is, from a defensive point of view, it takes an issue off the table. And then final point I’ll make is that from an offensive position, it actually has, as you pointed out, it’s not just deletions, it’s also additions. So you actually have a grand jury that has made findings because it has to vote on all of the language in the superseder just so people know that what happens when an indictment is presented to a grand jury, you read to them, they get handed out the proposed superseding indictment. Very often it is read word for word, but they are following along and seeing all of it, and they can raise questions and issues, and they don’t have to vote on it to say we agree with everything. So the grand jury has actually made findings based on probable cause of those additions. And so that’s something for those people who are counting, this now makes five grand juries that have found probable cause to believe that the former president committed multiple, multiple, multiple felonies. And because we have four different jurisdictions, but you now have two separate grand juries in D.C. with a pointed reference to the fact this was a new, clean grand jury. Mary McCord: Yeah. And you know, I do think that’s significant. And we know that Trump probably would have raised the grand jury point because he raised it in Manhattan. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: And so, you know, it was smart of Jack Smith to think we’re just going to present this anew. So where do we go from here in our closing to this episode? Friday, we will hear from the parties on their proposal for going forward. I suspect that there will be the Trump team seeking, you know, legal briefing before anything. You know, everyone keeps asking the question, will there be an evidentiary hearing? And I think one of the things that Jack Smith has tried to do in this indictment, because it’s returned by a grand jury based on probable cause, these allegations that should be taken as the allegations and that set up an argument that he can win on the law without needing an evidentiary hearing, which I don’t think there’s any way could happen before the election anyway, and I don’t think he’s going to ask for that. But I think Trump will not want an evidentiary hearing for obvious reasons. Andrew Weissmann: Of course not. Mary McCord: He will want just to be on the law. So it wouldn’t surprise me if they don’t first battle it out. Trump will say, look, let’s take the allegations that are currently in the indictment and I’m going to argue why they still are official acts for which the president is immune. Rule on that Judge Chutkan before you rule on anything else. Jack Smith, we’ll see how he responds. I’m speculating here on how I think it will play out. But I suspect that we’ll start with legal briefing and then decide if there are things that require evidentiary development because the Supreme Court did leave open the door in each of these areas pressure on Vice President Pence, pressure on state legislators and the false electoral scheme, and also the tweets and public statements on January 6th. They left open the door that factually that could be an area where the government could rebut any presumption of official acts or show that the conduct was not official because it was in his role as a candidate or is in his personal capacity or about things he had no responsibility for or vice president was acting in his Article 1 role. So there may be some things there, but I think it’ll be an iterative process as we go forward. And we’ll know more Friday and we’ll talk about it on Tuesday. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, so happy 100th episode -- Mary McCord: Yes. Woohoo. Andrew Weissmann: -- this week and not next week. And Happy Labor Day to everybody.

Now Playing in the 11th Circuit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 10:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-now-playing-11th-circuit-rcna168637,"In an attempt to revive the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case thrown out by Judge Aileen Cannon last month, Special Counsel Jack Smith has now filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals, a day early no less. MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord discuss Jack Smith’s arguments in the brief asserting that Judge Cannon had wrongfully ruled the special counsel had been appointed illegally. Then, looking ahead at proposals in the January 6 case expected to be filed later this week. And we take some of your listener questions!  Update: Following this recording, it was reported that Jack Smith revised his indictment in the January 6th case to address the Supreme Court’s ruling on immunity. A procedural filing is still expected this coming Friday, August 30th. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi and welcome back to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday, and Tuesday morning, August 27th, and I’m sort of stressing that, Mary, because we thought that we would be doing this tomorrow, Wednesday morning, and I think we even told people last week that we would be. Mary McCord: We did. Andrew Weissmann: Why is that? Because the brief that Jack Smith filed in the 11th Circuit, appealing Judge Cannon’s ruling, was due today, meaning that he would have up until, I think, kind of midnight to file it. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And so we were going to basically be up very, very late, assuming he was going to file the last minute, and then we were going to record tomorrow morning. But he surprised everyone and he filed a day early. Mary McCord: Not something the government does a lot. Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: At least not when I was in the government. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, no, everything’s always like at the last minute. Mary McCord: Last minute. Andrew Weissmann: No matter how much you prepare, there’s always like proof. There’s always something. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, anyway, here we are. It is August 27th. It is 10:22 a.m. And we both have leisurely read the brief. Mary McCord: Yeah. I didn’t have to stay up late to read it. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So Mary, gee, what’s on our dance card today? Mary McCord: Yeah. And by the way, I’m Andrew’s co-host, Mary McCord. Good morning and good evening, whatever you happen to be listening. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, everyone knows except for our new listeners. So welcome our new listeners. Mary McCord: Yes, so obviously we’re going to spend quite a bit of time today talking about that filing. That is of course the appeal of Judge Cannon’s dismissal of the entire Mar-a-Lago prosecution on the grounds that Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. And then we will talk about, really, we’ll just kind of anticipate what the parties will file on Friday in the D.C. January 6 related case. The parties are due to file a joint proposal for how to proceed in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. And if they have disagreements and can’t agree to spell those disagreements out, then the court will actually hear from them next week on September the 5th. And then we are going to get to some listener questions. We have some really good ones. Andrew Weissmann: I know, they’re amazing. Mary McCord: Yes, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: They’re really amazing, so keep them coming and thank you. The quality is keeping us on our toes. They’re excellent. But Mary, let’s turn to the brief that was filed. And I thought maybe we’d start with something that is not totally substantive about what their position is, but rather sort of the tone and sort of the tenor of the brief. And then we’ll go to the substance of the argument and then maybe what was not said. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Which is big. But I just thought it might be worth a note that this was an incredibly dignified brief in my view, in terms of tone. It read in a very dispassionate way. In some ways it reminds me, this isn’t quite an anecdote, not this early. But I remember once we had such an outrageous thing that had happened on the defense side, that our submission to the district court judge, every single adjective and adverb was taken out. We just set out the law and the facts as dispassionately as possible. And in some ways, it was more devastating by doing that. And that was my reaction to this that some people might have wanted to see more hammer and tongs, but I thought that the tenor of it was both the right tone for the 11th Circuit, where they don’t know who their panel is yet, so they don’t know which judge they might get, but also made it stronger. Mary McCord: I mean, in general, that was certainly always my approach and I think the government’s approach generally to briefing is that they don’t have a dog in the fight in the sense of trying to be overly hyperbolic. The government feels like what it’s trying to do is to do justice for the American people and the best way to do that is to use the facts and the law in support of your arguments as opposed to adjectives and adverbs. And this is something that I’ve carried with me having left the government, you know, having spent a large chunk of my time in government doing appellate work. But even in my work at ICAP now in my day job, oftentimes my role when I review a brief is to take out all those adjectives and adverbs that people put in when they draft because they’re mad or it’s cathartic -- Andrew Weissmann: They’re triggered. Mary McCord: -- or they’re triggered, right. And then here comes Mary, like, we’re taking that adjective out, we’re taking this adjective out. And everyone knows it, all the attorneys who I work with, they know it, they’re like, that first draft, you just got to get out all your, you know, strong feelings about how wrong the lower court was when you’re the one on appeal, but then you want to come back, you want to take a step back. You want to just let your arguments on the law and how the law applies to the facts and how the trial court got it wrong, or if you’re defending the trial court, how the trial court got it right and do that through the persuasiveness of your arguments rather than the hyperbolic nature of your rhetoric. And that’s where I think we see a difference. And we have yet to see the responsive brief by Mr. Trump’s attorneys. But if you just think about other things that they have filed, including in this case before Judge Cannon, theirs have always been more hyperbolic than what -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- we’ve seen from the government. Although I will say some of the briefing in some of the appellate’s briefs in the January 6 related case was, I’d say, somewhat toned down from what had been briefed in the trial court, even on Mr. Trump’s side. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, it’s a big spectrum, I suspect, based on who is writing it. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Just to be clear what Mary and I are saying for our listeners, is not that this isn’t a strong sort of hash it -- Mary McCord: Right. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- brief in terms of laying out why Judge Cannon is wrong. So this is really a question of tone and style. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And it can go a long way in persuasion with respect to with the -- Mary McCord: And credibility. Andrew Weissmann: -- 11th Circuit. Exactly. And especially since they do not know who their audience is, but the right thing to do and strategically the right thing to do. But maybe there’s a good segue to -- Mary McCord: What’s it say? Andrew Weissmann: -- what’s it say. And I have to tell you, this felt like just incoming. Mary McCord: It did. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, we knew that Judge Cannon was wrong, but seeing it laid out page after page. It’s about 51 pages of actual argument on this issue. And it’s primarily on the issue of the appointment of the special counsel. Does the attorney general have the power to appoint a special counsel? There’s a small bit about the financing. It’s basically like a throwaway -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- because there’s just nothing to that argument from Judge Cannon. And I’d say it’s in two sort of chunks, one longer than the other. But their first point is because they’re arguing to the 11th Circuit, which is a court of appeals, but has to follow Supreme Court precedent. The first point is that this was decided in the Nixon case and it wasn’t dicta, and that the 11th Circuit has to follow it. We can talk about that more. And then the second issue is how the text of the congressional statutes and the history and interpretation of the Department of Justice, of the courts, of even Congress and how they viewed it is all on the side of even if you didn’t have that Supreme Court decision, that is binding on the 11th Circuit. Even if you got to the issue of is there a statute that authorizes this for the attorney general to appoint a special counsel, that all of those things, the tax, the history, the consistent interpretation, the other court decisions are all uniformly against -- Mary McCord: Congress continuing to fund things and never legislating in a way that would take away the power that the attorney general had been exercising time and time again throughout history. I think that’s an important part too of statutory interpretation. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. In fact, can we just say on that, not only did they not change it, but they’ve actually been assuming -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- that, of course, this is the case that the special counsel could be appointed. And just to be clear, it’s not political. Democrats and Republicans have done the same thing. In other words, you have Democratic administrations and your Republican administrations all appointing special counsels. Some special counsels are within the department, some special counsels are initially outside of the department, and then they’re brought in to do this job. And the brief is, I think, just devastating. Mary McCord: Well, it certainly historical and it actually does grammar lessons on things like what a past participle is and how past participles can still be used in the present tense. So I was like, ooh, this has taken me back to high school English when you used to have the diagram sentences. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Like I’m sure no one listening remembers that except those of us -- Andrew Weissmann: I remember it. Mary McCord: Oh my gosh. I don’t think they do that anymore. Anyway, let’s go back to the -- Andrew Weissmann: Wait, you don’t think they diagram sentences? Mary McCord: I don’t remember my kids who are now in their 20s, I do not remember them diagramming sentences, but I could be wrong about that. Andrew Weissmann: Wow. Mary McCord: It’s not like I looked at all their homework, but I don’t think so. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, by the way, you know Mary, we’re now going to get, like, this is -- Mary McCord: Oh, I know. Andrew Weissmann: -- we’re crowdsourcing. Mary McCord: All kinds of people are going to be writing to us about diagramming sentences. And our producer’s looking at us like, what are you talking about? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly because he’s born -- Mary McCord: He’s much younger than us. Andrew Weissmann: -- in a generation where they didn’t diagram sentences. Mary McCord: That’s right. Yes, that’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Mary McCord: Okay, let’s go back to the dictum point because I think this is important. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: So, United States versus Nixon, this was a case that went to the Supreme Court. It is a case where the special counsel appointed to investigate Watergate, the Watergate scandal, had issued a subpoena to President Nixon for the White House tapes and other information. And so he went in to challenge that and the case is primarily about executive privilege. He said he had executive privilege not to turn over the things that were subpoenaed by the special prosecutor. So the court first had to determine, was this case even justiciable because it did go up to the Supreme Court? Meaning, what Nixon had argued is, this is just an intra-agency dispute, because I’m the president of the United States. This special prosecutor is trying to get documents, the court shouldn’t bother with this at all. And the court said, no, this is justiciable. This is something that we can rule on because the special prosecutor was appointed pursuant to statutes that the attorney general used to make this appointment and a regulation issued by the Department of Justice. That regulation is in play. While it’s in play, I mean, it’s still enforced. It’s never been repealed. That regulation governs here for the special counsel to be able to seek these documents. So we will now rule substantively on your claim of executive privilege. And the issue there was is that the Supreme Court said that the test that a special prosecutor has to show is really this compelling need for the information in furtherance of his responsibilities in this criminal investigation, one that essentially a balancing test based on his compelling need for the information here. Again, we’re talking about the Watergate tapes and other information, and that outweighed any concerns about executive privilege. So what the special counsel now, Jack Smith, is saying is Judge Cannon was wrong to say that it was just dicta in the Supreme Court that the special prosecutor appointed in Watergate was constitutionally appointed, that that’s just dicta, that that didn’t matter, that the court assumed it was lawful and went on to decide the executive privilege question. And that’s just flat out wrong. If you go and you read the case, the court didn’t say we are assuming that the special prosecutor was lawfully appointed and now we’ll rule on executive privilege. They went through, as I was just explaining, the fact that the special prosecutor was appointed under a set of regulations that were authorized and that is where the authority comes from. And so to just give a thought or two about dicta, because people may be saying, what is dicta? Andrew Weissmann: Right, yeah. That’s what I was going to get to, yeah, exactly. Mary McCord: So dicta mean sometimes courts will say, we’re not going to resolve every issue in front of us, we’re going to get to the issue we care about and we’re going to either assume something and not actually have the parties argue it, not make a decision on it. We’ll just assume it and we’ll go on to the next thing. Sometimes they will also be issuing a decision and they’ll say a few things about something else. And in fact, we’ve seen that in the 14th Amendment section three case and other cases, they say a few things, but those are not load bearing. In other words, they are not an essential -- Andrew Weissmann: It’s embroidery. Mary McCord: Yeah, it’s embroidery. This in U.S. v. Nixon was necessary to the holding. Andrew Weissmann: Right. By the way, that is what the D.C. Circuit said when they were -- Mary McCord: Every circuit and every court. Andrew Weissmann: -- reviewing this issue. They said this was necessary. I have to say it’s so disrespectful of Judge Cannon because she’s thinking, you know what, I want to get this, I’m just going to ignore the Supreme Court because the current Supreme Court might have a different view. But as a district court judge, you don’t have that luxury. Mary McCord: You don’t. Andrew Weissmann: You have to be faithful to the Supreme Court decision even if you disagree with it. And she could have said, you know what, I disagree with this, blah, blah, blah, but I’m bound by it. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And she didn’t. To me, it’s just another badge of being triggered. Let’s just be polite, poorly reasoned her decision and outcome determinative. So that’s how she put aside the Nixon case and I -- Mary McCord: And I think she did feel empowered by Justice Thomas’s -- Andrew Weissmann: But it was only one justice, right? Mary McCord: That’s right, I know. But I think, as we talked about after the immunity decision came down, when Justice Thomas wrote separately to talk about the appointment of the special prosecutor, I mean, it’s not even dicta because it wasn’t part of the majority opinion. It’s just one justice’s opinion on something that had never even been argued or briefed in the Supreme Court in the immunity case. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: But that I think she saw as, ooh, this is my -- Andrew Weissmann: It’s an invitation. Yeah. Mary McCord: -- open door, yeah, to go ahead and talk about this. Andrew Weissmann: So then the court went on to go through all the various statutes. And I wanted to sort of highlight two points, Mary. One is, sort of big picture that I think people will understand about what Judge Cannon was saying and the ludicrousness that Congress would have had this kind of statutory scheme in mind. According to Judge Cannon, the sin of all sins here was that Jack Smith was outside the department and then was appointed and then in the department. Leave aside that she makes the fundamental error that we’ve talked about where she describes him as a private attorney because he was a private attorney, but then he’s hired as special counsel, so then he’s in the department. And she says there has to be essentially a time gap where the person was outside the department, then they’re in the department, then it would be okay to give him the role of special counsel. In other words, as long as the person is in the department, then they can be a special counsel. In other words, the attorney general could just take somebody from within the department and make them a special counsel, but the sin here is having hired them from outside the department. And one of the things that the brief says is -- Mary McCord: And can I just interject that this is where the past participle point comes in? Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly. But the big picture, I mean, yes, they have a linguistic relevance, but the big picture about how ludicrous it is, they said that could be one second from -- Mary McCord: Yeah, you could hire him. Okay, now he’s been retained. He’s now a department employee. Now we’re going to appoint him. Andrew Weissmann: Right, which is just insane that that would be their view. And she does that based on this past participle argument that --- Mary McCord: And the words are -- Andrew Weissmann: Go ahead, yeah. Yes. Mary McCord: -- the statute of Section 515B of the Title 28 of the U.S. Code empowers the attorney general to commission attorneys who are, and here’s the quote, who are specially retained under authority of the Department of Justice as special assistants to the attorney general or special attorneys. So she takes specially retained and say, that’s the past tense, which means you have to have already been retained in the Department of Justice before you can be appointed as a special assistant to the attorney general or a special attorney. And that is a past participle, specially retained, and according to the brief and to grammar rules and grammar scholars who are quoted or grammarians who are quoted, is that a word? I think it is. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, it is. Mary McCord: Specially retained in that usage even as a past participle is being used in the present tense. So anyway, it’s kind of interesting aside because I’m reading it, I’m like, I can’t believe we’re getting -- Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: -- a brief on the use of past participles. But anyway, to your point, specially retained, even if you took her point of it having to be past tense. Again, okay, we hire him. Now he’s retained. Five minutes later, we appoint him as special counsel. Andrew Weissmann: One second. They literally say one second would work. Mary McCord: They do. So it’s kind of ridiculous. Andrew Weissmann: So one other point, which I thought was really smart, a smart messaging to the 11th Circuit, and I think smart in terms of where this could go in terms of potential Supreme Court review, which is that in two places in the brief, they specifically call out writings or roles that two of the current justices have -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- taken in the past. So on page 42, they make reference to a law review article that Brett Kavanaugh wrote called “The President and the Independent Counsel.” It was in the Georgia Law Journal in 1998, where he talks about the quote, “deeply rooted tradition of appointing an outside prosecutor to run particular investigations.” Notice outside prosecutor, just to the point that we were just making. And that’s something, by the way, I’m going to give a shout out to Lawrence O’Donnell because many, many months ago, he had found this and had a whole show where he very much was like reading chapter and verse from what Justice Kavanaugh. Mary McCord: From Brett Kavanaugh. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Second, in footnote 22, this is something that we talked about, Mary, in a prior episode, which is that the brief has a footnote talking about when the Independent Counsel Act was sunsetting. That was after Ken Starr, who was appointed an independent counsel and people had sort of issues with it. Mary McCord: Under a statute, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly, when that statute was sunsetting, people said, well, you know, there were two ways to appoint a special counsel. One was under the Independent Counsel Act, but the attorney general always had this other authority, which is what’s at issue here. And that is something that is called out in footnote 22, because when the Independent Counsel Act was sunsetting, there was a bipartisan commission that was sort of put together, commission’s probably the wrong word, but sort of group of eight distinguished citizens, that’s how it’s described. And it was Senators Robert Dole and George Mitchell, hence the bipartisan nature. And the eight distinguished citizens included one member who is the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts. And it was to study and recommend alternatives to the Independent Counsel Act. And what the footnote points out is, although the ultimate recommendation was to have sort of legislative cure, what the report said, and I’m going to, again, quote from this, is quote, “since creation of the Department of Justice in 1870, the attorney general has had standing statutory authority, now in 28 U.S.C. Section 515, to retain a counsel as a special assistant to the attorney general or as a special attorney.” So again, has standing statutory authority since 1870. And I thought it was just so notable that they had these two sorts of shout outs to these current Supreme Court justices. Mary McCord: Yeah, absolutely. And when you talk about sort of devastating stuff in the brief, I think that’s it. I have two more things I want to talk about. One is fallout, fallout from this Judge Cannon decision and also what’s not in this brief. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But let’s take a break and come back and talk about those things. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. So we have been talking about the U.S. government’s appellate brief in the 11th Circuit now. And I want to talk about, you know, we had whole episodes about the fallout of the immunity decision, the Supreme Court’s immunity decision, and some of that fallout meaning collateral consequences, other things that were called into question. And one of the things that really stood out to me in this brief by Jack Smith and his team is their argument about essentially the fallout, the collateral consequences of Judge Cannon’s decision if it were to be affirmed. And this is actually on page 56 of the brief. They’re saying that the district court’s reasoning also needlessly cast doubt on longstanding practices in the Department of Justice and across the whole Executive Branch. And here’s the key here. It suggests -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- that every special counsel throughout history who was appointed from outside the Department of Justice, who did not assist a U.S. attorney, was invalidly appointed, and that every attorney general who made such appointments acted ultra vires, meaning outside of law, that Congress repeatedly overlooked the persistent pattern of errors and the Supreme Court itself failed to spot that flaw in Nixon. And then they go on, and I’m quoting all this, “but it also goes much further. If the attorney general lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office other than the few that are specifically identified by statute.” And I will note, they say at a minimum, that list includes high-ranking department positions such as the Deputy Solicitor General, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, my old job, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, wouldn’t have been able to appoint me in that position. And the district court’s rationale would likewise raise questions about hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch, including in the departments of defense, state, treasury, and labor, which all rely on statutes resembling those that the attorney general uses, but in those cases to support their secretary’s authority to appoint inferior officers. So again, we’re talking about, look at what she’s done here. If you actually were to affirm that, it would call so many things into question that our government has relied on and Congress and the other branches have just relied on throughout centuries at this point. Andrew Weissmann: So the thing that’s not in the brief -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- that everyone is going to be thinking this is like we need it, we buried the lead -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- which is that Jack Smith does not ask for the 11th Circuit to not just reverse Judge Cannon. That’s obviously what they ask for. But they don’t say, and send it back to a different judge. They don’t say that she should be recused and taken off the case. Now, the court has that power, regardless of the parties ask for it or not. And it’s not very commonly used, but it is something that the court can do. But it is not something that Jack Smith asked for. And I was trying to think of why they may not have done that. I’d be interested in the discussion about whether what you would have done. But when I was thinking about why they may not have done that is one, if you’re asking for that as the part of the relief, it puts a little bit more pressure on getting the main ruling they want, which is a reversal. Now, obviously the court can say we’re going to reverse but we’re not taking her off the case, but it makes it atmospherically a little bit of the thumb on the scale that you are asking for both of those things. The second is it’s a little bit of the cart before the horse in the sense that yes, she has been reversed twice by the 11th Circuit. You could imagine some discussion internally that’s either, you know, we just don’t do that, we leave it to the court to do. And second, as an institution matter, that’s not something that the department engages in. You get sort of stuck with who you’re assigned. But the second is that, let’s see what the 11th Circuit and the Supreme Court does with this. If we win it, and it’s an outright sort of slam of her in the way that the 11th Circuit has done before, and we have three decisions now that say she is off the hook. I don’t mean in that sense, like she’s -- Mary McCord: Probably need a different -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: Yeah, probably a different. Andrew Weissmann: Step off the curb. No film on the camera. The elevator doesn’t go to the top. Whatever expression you want to use. You could at that point deal with the issue, but wait for the ultimate win, whether it’s in the 11th Circuit or the Supreme Court before you were to make that decision. And finally, because this case is not going to be heard until after the election, there is an ability to have that particular issue decided in a calmer environment, hopefully, when there either is a Trump presidency, in which case this case is going away and its sort of moot anyway in many ways because the Department of Justice is going to be ordered to just stand down, or it will be a Kamala Harris presidency and it can be dealt with at that point. Mary McCord: Yeah. Well, I don’t disagree with anything, you know, that you’ve said and how you’ve described it. I also would not have sought recusal if I were still in the government and I had been on this brief. I think, you know, first of all, my entire career, I never pushed to seek recusal of a judge. It’s something that the department does very, very rarely. And I think you need to show more concrete evidence of sort of impartiality or bias than even what we have here. And I know some people, listeners are gonna be like, what is wrong with you, Mary? Look at all of her rulings. But I will say, sometimes she has ruled in Jack Smith’s favor, even though a lot of us have a lot of speculation about what biases she may have toward the former president. In the rulings and in her statements in court, I don’t think they always come out in a way that is that clear. And I think that what Jack Smith thinks, and I agree with this, is that we win on the law here and we’re just gonna argue the law and she was wrong on the law and we’re gonna seek her reversal. But we can deal with these kinds of legal issues without having to take her off the case and it would take something more to get to that point. I think they also do not want to look political and that would be inherent, not only in this environment that we’re in generally, but also because we are literally here coming up on the eve of the election. I mean, the Trump brief will be due 30 days after yesterday, which is, I think, September 26. The government’s reply brief will be due 21 days after that, which I think is something like October 17. And at that point, we really, really are practically on the eve of the election. You know, to have recusal be part of this, I think the department was very concerned, as it has been and as it rightfully should be, about not doing anything that could be perceived, even if it’s something warranted, but that could be perceived as being political. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, so we’re going to agree to disagree on this in that I agree with you in terms of not seeking it now, but I think ultimately, they are going to have to seek it because I think she’s so erratic in her rulings and she has so many ways left open to really screw up this case in ways that are unlawful, including what’s called rule 29, meaning she could start the trial and then just get rid of it, and that’s not appealable. So I do think they’re going to have to deal with it. I also think, although I agree with you, that the standard for recusal, which I also have never saw in any case, is and should be very high because you don’t want people to just say, oh, I don’t like the judge, I want a new one. Mary McCord: Right. And I don’t even know that’s a disagreeing. I’m saying I wouldn’t do it now. There may be a time later. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, yeah. Mary McCord: We always figure it out. Yeah, the rest is dicta. Andrew Weissmann: The rest is dicta, right. We wouldn’t have done it now because it can be done later. So Mary, is this a good place to take a break and then we’re gonna briefly talk about what’s gonna happen this Friday with the joint filing and then get to listener questions. Mary McCord: Sounds great. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, let’s speculate about Friday. Friday is when Trump’s team and jack Smith’s team are due to file their proposal for what the order of proceedings should be. What type of proceedings there should be on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court to Judge Tanya Chutkan and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the January 6th case? And I want to give you a little bit of something that I learned from a reporter, and the reporter has now reported this, this is in Bloomberg Law, when he called me to ask me questions about this last week. He said he was hearing that Jack Smith is not going to ask for some sort of mini trial before the election, and that Jack Smith is concerned about a mini trial sort of previewing his hand and he wouldn’t my thoughts on that. I responded, I can see that and that argument, but more importantly, I don’t think there’s even time for a mini trial before the election, even if he wanted one. And I could see him not wanting to try to push for something that, again, might look political and that, you know, I think he’s really going to be focused on. How do we narrow this case in a way that we have our strongest chance as the federal government of being able to put on a case without running afoul of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the immunity case? In other words, how do we make sure everything we’re charging is not an official act and that the evidence we want to use is either not official acts evidence or is something that’s in a public record or, you know, allowed by the Supreme Court’s ruling? And that his focus may be on narrowing it. And I know a lot of people are probably disappointed. And I don’t even know if that’s right. This reporter says he’s getting this from various sources, but that’s what he’s telling me. Andrew Weissmann: So remember, this is the case where the filing was supposed to have been made three weeks ago. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: That the Department of Justice asked for three more weeks to sort of coordinate with other parts of the department as they are required to do because see our earlier discussion, the special counsel is part of the Department of Justice. Mary McCord: Of the department. Andrew Weissmann: And so I do think that this will be interesting, maybe more for us insiders to sort of be tea leaf reading about sort of what they are thinking about how this would apply and what the issues are for other parts of the department. We talked about the National Security Division, civil rights, environmental. There are millions of parts of the department, not just the criminal division and the National Security Divisions that are sort of instrumental to this case. So I think that’s going to be interesting. I agree with you that as a timing matter, it may be hard. I also, on the reporting, the reason that a reporter would have a story like that in my estimation is very frequently, and I saw this when I was on the Mueller investigation, when prosecutors have to have discussions with defense lawyers, and here they do have to because it’s a joint filing, there is nothing that prevents the defense lawyers from speaking to the press. Mary McCord: That’s right. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not even a leak in the sense that it’s not improper. Mary McCord: They’re not under a gag order. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I’m not saying that defense lawyers are lying about it. It’s that it’s not totally clear whether they’ve omitted something and whether things get lost in translation. And when I was reading the “New York Times” reporting on this, that wording was interesting to me because it said things like the Department of Justice is going to seek a major hearing. So that’s consistent with their saying there may have to be some hearing. Mary McCord: Of course, right. Andrew Weissmann: And with facts being presented, but that remains to be seen. Will they ask for a hearing on what issues, how would the facts be adduced? Would it be with live witnesses or could it be through the submission of affidavits or what are called FBI 302s, that’s notes of interviews. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Could it be grand jury testimony that they’re given permission to make public? So a lot of that remains to be seen, but that’s essentially what we’re going to be keeping our eye out for this Friday and you all should be too. Mary McCord: And we’ll be talking a lot about it next Tuesday. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. So, listener questions. Mary, do you want me to give you the first one? Mary McCord: Sure. Andrew Weissmann: We can go back and forth? Mary McCord: Yes, let’s do it. Andrew Weissmann: So here’s the first one from Craig, which is, can the 14th Amendment prohibition under the Insurrection Clause be lifted by a presidential pardon? What do you think? Mary McCord: This takes us back to when we were discussing the case involving the attempt by Colorado to disqualify former President Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment Section 3. Listeners will recall that constitutional amendment says that no one shall hold any office under the United States, including the presidency, who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellions against the Constitution of the United States. And that disqualification in the 14th Amendment Section 3, that is not a criminal conviction, does not require a criminal conviction. The Supreme Court did say it would require some sort of action by Congress, something for Congress to do. It’s not sort of totally self-implementing there. But it would not have to be a criminal conviction. And it’s a criminal conviction that the president has the ability to pardon. Query whether he could pardon himself. That’s an unanswered question. No one’s ever had to answer it. A lot of scholars think he couldn’t. But even putting that aside, what happens in section three is not itself a conviction. Can’t be pardoned. That said, the constitutional amendment itself does provide for a way around that, and that is if Congress, by vote of two-thirds of each House, removes this disability, removes this disqualification. And in fact, that did happen after the Civil War with respect to people who had been found to have engaged in rebellion against the Constitution, insurrection or rebellion, and some of that disability under the 14th Amendment, Section 3, that disqualification was removed by vote of Congress. So it’s something that Congress could act to do something about, but not that a president could just pardon himself from. Andrew Weissmann: By the way, that is like the Halcyon day is where it’s you could think that two thirds of the Congress would do anything. Mary McCord: Could agree on anything. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: Okay, let’s move on. This is a really, really good question from David. Do we now have a Catch-22 with the immunity ruling where a future Supreme Court will only get to reconsider immunity if another president is charged with a crime? If so, it seems like under a normal president, we’ll never get to overturn it, that meaning the decision, and it’ll sit like a bomb waiting for a demagogue to take full advantage of it. Andrew Weissmann: What a great question. I think the answer is that may very well be the case, that it’s hard to figure out what the opportunity will be to have that come up. But I could see a situation where there is a criminal investigation, not a prosecution, but an investigation of a president. And there’s almost like a manufactured challenge, or maybe not even manufactured, to whether that investigation could go forward as to the president. But even that, I think the department could say, well, it’s premature to decide that issue, and it’s premature to decide whether it’s been rebutted and whether it’s core and all of those issues. So it may be possible to think of a way to get the criminal investigation to the Supreme Court, but it would be unusual, to say the least. The other, which would be really difficult, would be for the court on its own with a different makeup to somehow take the opportunity to revisit it in a related case. And the thing that I’m thinking of is in the Trump versus Hawaii case, that is the case that dealt with the so-called Muslim ban. It actually was the third iteration of the Muslim ban. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: The court on its own said as a little throwaway, to be clear, we are overruling Korematsu, the Japanese-American internment case. And it overruled it in the narrowest possible way, by the way. That’s a little like -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- I’m a total nerd, Mary. You know that I teach national security law also, but I’m not going to not digress on that. But that’s the second way in which the court could try to revisit this without the sort of a live case being presented because of the ramifications. Yeah, what do you got? Mary McCord: Well, remember, this case is not over, right? This case is back in front of Judge Chutkan, the January 6th case. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, I love it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love it. Mary McCord: She’s going to make rulings about immunity. She’s going to make rulings about official acts and unofficial acts and evidence that the government can get in. I think, you know, if this case, depending on whether this case remains, because recall, if former President Trump is reelected, he will likely just shut down and order this case dismissed completely. But if that does not happen and the case proceeds, those rulings that Judge Chutkan’s makes are something that probably the Trump team will appeal and could find their way back to the Supreme Court. And at that point, the government certainly could come in and try to explain how some of what the court decided this summer is wrong and unworkable and, you know, not supported by history and essentially try to get them to revisit. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, presumably, I hadn’t really thought of that because it would presumably be in front of the same court. Mary McCord: Same court. Andrew Weissmann: Presumably, it may change. Okay. Excellent point. Let me ask you another question. This one is from Mark. I’m going to read the opening part. Mary McCord: The beginning, I love it. Andrew Weissmann: Because it says, I’m afraid this question may land Andrew back on Trigger Avenue, but here it goes. So by the way, Mark, clearly a frequent listener. Mary McCord: That’s right. He knows Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: And Mark should note that because it does trigger me, I’m going to ask this of Mary, the more level-headed person here. So here’s the question. As you know, Trump has filed, that’s technically wrong. Trump has said that he intends to file. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: He has not yet actually filed, but this says Trump has filed a $100 million lawsuit against the United States for damages caused by the FBI’s raid, that’s in quotes, on Mar-a-Lago. And the question is, if Trump were to file that suit, and if he were to become president again, could he order the Justice Department to settle the lawsuit for many millions of dollars, and thus put taxpayer money right into his pocket legally? Would such a settlement have to be approved by a judge, or is there any other check to prevent this? Mary McCord: This might even trigger me. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So what do you think, Mary? Mary McCord: So, and just to your point on this isn’t a lawsuit yet, just by federal government regulations, you file administrative notice to the Department of Justice of your intent to file that suit and the department has something like 180 days to say, you know what, we’ll go ahead and resolve this and we’ll pay you blah, blah, blah. They’re not going to do that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: I think -- Andrew Weissmann: This -- Mary McCord: Well, this administration -- Andrew Weissmann: That’s the question. Mary McCord: That’s true, 180 days will go into at this point August, barely, but we’ll go into the next administration, I think, if my six-month math is correct, because we are in late August. So I think probably he could. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, he would be the head of the Executive Branch. He would be directing his Department of Justice to take a position in litigation. And there is at least an argument under the immunity ruling that is an official act, communicating with your own Department of Justice. This listener, Mark, probably recalls one of the things we discussed, is that in that immunity ruling, the one thing the court did answer is it said, communications with your attorney general, between the president and the attorney general are official acts. And between the president and other, you know, high level officials at the Department of Justice about investigations and prosecutions, and even if they were sham investigations and prosecutions, are official acts for which the president is immune. Now, immunity, of course, has only to do with his criminal liability. So it doesn’t mean carte blanche, you can do all kinds of corrupt things, but it does mean you will have immunity from any criminal responsibility. But I will say that yes, settlements if there is actually litigation pending do have to be approved by a court. And I do think a judge might look quite askance at something like this, might even try to appoint a special outside amicus lawyer to argue what normally the government would argue in order to defend against a $100 million lawsuit. And so we could see that kind of thing, a court actually intervening to try to prevent something like that from happening. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, just remember when a court, if there is a pending civil lawsuit, would have limited ability to review that. And that has happened in civil cases, for instance, in class action cases, it’s more routine to make sure that the class is being fairly treated. And we saw that, for instance, in the Flynn criminal investigation where -- Mary McCord: Right, that was criminal though, right, yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- where there was a plea and the court appointed someone essentially to represent the court’s interest in deciding whether essentially it was collusive between the department then run by Bill Barr and the defense. But again, there was an issue about limited authority. Mary McCord: And that’s actually under the federal rules, but you’re right. I mean, on most civil litigation, the court would not have a role unless it’s a class action. I kind of misspoke on that. Andrew Weissmann: And there’d be many ways also to get around it, essentially, because the issue is it’s very hard for the court to say, I’m forcing the Department of Justice to litigate -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- because the department could just be like, we’re getting rid of this case. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And especially if the case hasn’t yet been brought because of the timing that we talked about the six-month period, and it’s just a private settlement where it never is going to court at all. And there’s just a private agreement between the Department of Justice and a dismissal, you know -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- an agreement that this is binding that Donald Trump couldn’t now bring any more lawsuits and in exchange for which the department is going to pay X millions of dollars. It seems to me that you could have, you know, potentially Congress trying to do something, but I don’t think it would be the courts and the immunity decision, as you pointed out, would have important dicta because it came up in a criminal context, but it obviously has civil implications as well, given their reliance on a different Nixon decision in the civil context. Mary McCord: Yes, that’s right. Now, I could see a taxpayer lawsuit against the Department of Justice might get thrown out. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I mean, this is one where, Mark, this is just an excellent question, and it is fodder for one more reason why the criminal immunity decision is so bad. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And an example of what Joe Biden has said, which is in light of that immunity decision, who inhabits the Oval Office. Again, whether Republican or Democratic, regardless of party, the idea of self-restraint and public service is such an important component given how much power that person has. So excellent, excellent question. Mary McCord: All really great today. Thank you so much to our listeners. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, before I thank everyone, do you know what we’re on the cusp of? Mary McCord: I just learned what we’re on the cusp of. Andrew Weissmann: Me too. And the cusp is our next episode, we turn 100. Mary McCord: Oh my gosh, we do not turn 100. Andrew Weissmann: I feel 100. Mary McCord: It is our 100th episode. Andrew Weissmann: But you know what keeps me young? Talking to you, Mary. Mary McCord: Okay, me too. Andrew Weissmann: So, it’ll be our 100th episode. This is 99. Mary McCord: That’s really exciting. Andrew Weissmann: It’s been such a great ride. Mary McCord: It has been.

"Looking for cash, Trump combines two of his money-making schemes",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 9:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/looking-cash-trump-combines-two-money-making-schemes-rcna168626,"Shortly before Christmas 2022, Donald Trump raised a few eyebrows with an item published to his social media platform. “AMERICA NEEDS A SUPERHERO!” the former president wrote. “I will be making a MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT tomorrow. Thank you!” Ample speculation soon followed, but few guessed what the Republican would unveil a day later: The “official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection.” For “only” $99 each, his customers could buy non-fungible tokens, which the candidate described as “very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.” This was, to be sure, high on the list of Trump’s cringeworthy money-making schemes, alongside an unrelated pitch that came a year later when the former president sold off pieces of the suit he said he wore while taking his mug shot after one of his criminal indictments. This week, believe it or not, the GOP candidate managed to combine the two schemes. The Hill reported: Describing his latest money-making scheme in an online video, Trump said: “It’s really something” — a sentiment that was easy to agree with, though not for the reasons he had in mind. Part of what makes this striking is the degree to which Trump released a video of himself that made him look like a two-bit carnival huckster. Just as notably, I’ve never seen a candidate for the nation’s highest office do something like this during a presidential campaign. In fact, it’s important to emphasize that the Republican nominee isn’t doing this to get contributions, because the money apparently won’t benefit his 2024 operation. This is about Trump looking for money to put in his pocket, not his coffers. But let’s also not lose sight of the larger pattern. The gold sneakers. The Trump-endorsed Bible. The fake university. The board game. The steaks. We’re talking about a politician who appears to meander from one get-rich-quick opportunity to the next, without much regard for merit or dignity. It’s not a secret that the Republican’s finances are a mess, and a recent Washington Post analysis added, “He is in a cash crunch — personally and politically — and has been unafraid throughout his career to put the Trump name on anything that might yield a stream of revenue.” When it comes to someone seeking the White House, that’s ... not ideal."
What Jack Smith’s changes tell us about his Jan. 6 case against Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 9:38 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jack-smith-trump-indictment-changes-jan-6-supreme-court-rcna168525,"Just over a year ago, special counsel Jack Smith indicted former President Donald Trump over his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. There was a bit of déjà vu then on Tuesday when Smith revealed that he had obtained a superseding indictment against Trump, keeping the same four charges in place but with the backing of a different federal grand jury. When comparing the version that was handed up on Tuesday with the original from last year, the changes appear to be focused on deconflicting the charges against Trump with the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on the matter. Smith opted against the most cautious approach he could have taken, stripping the case down to its essence to fully bulletproof it from further Supreme Court intervention. Instead, he has chosen to attempt the strongest case available against Trump within the fetters that the court has now placed on him. The most obvious changes relate to the court’s sweeping decision in Trump v. United States. Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion found that all presidents, including Trump, have absolute immunity from criminal charges for exercising their “core Constitutional duties.” Roberts specifically cited Trump’s communications with the Justice Department — in which he tried to force the DOJ to back his false election claims — as off-limits for prosecution. Smith has complied accordingly, deleting the entirety of the DOJ evidence from the indictment’s narrative, along with any references to Justice Department officials pushing back on his lies about mass voter fraud. Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark is no longer an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator. Also gone are any references to the White House counsel and most references to any conversations Trump might have had with people on his staff within the executive branch. Beyond the absolute immunity for a president’s core duties, Roberts also ruled that there is “presumptive immunity” for things that fall within the scope of the president’s “remaining official actions.” It now falls to Smith to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan which of Trump’s actions were “unofficial” and thus beyond the reach of this presumed immunity — but he is blocked from being able to use “official acts” as evidence to make the case for why immunity should not be granted. The special counsel has accepted that challenge with gusto. In the new indictment, Smith carefully makes clear why many of the steps Trump and his allies took were in no way part of the president’s job. Nowhere is that more evident than when it comes to Trump’s pressure campaign against former Vice President Mike Pence. After numerous other avenues had failed, Trump leaned on Pence to simply declare him the winner when presiding over the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. The opinion in Trump v. U.S. hinted that those conversations between the president and vice president might fall within the scope of presumptive immunity, but Smith didn’t mince words in disagreeing: Moreover, Smith takes great pains to emphasize how many of the people acting on Trump’s behalf did so in the name of his presidential campaign, not his presidency. There are still six unindicted co-conspirators listed in the document, he writes, “none of whom were government officials during the conspiracies and all of whom were acting in a private capacity.” The new indictment also addresses the role of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has attempted to use his former position as cover from being investigated or indicted. Smith now clarifies that Meadows “sometimes handled private and Campaign-related logistics for the Defendant” when describing Trump’s now infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Interestingly, the new indictment’s edits also appear to consider a second Supreme Court ruling as well. A few days before the decision in Trump v. U.S., the court ruled in Fischer v. United States, which considered the Justice Department’s use of a federal statute on obstructing an official proceeding. Roughly a quarter of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged under Section 1512(c)(2) for their role in disrupting the counting of electoral votes, according to the Justice Department. There was concern when the case was being adjudicated that the court might entirely invalidate two of the four charges against Trump. The 6-3 decision did narrow the scope of the law in question but did so in a way that let the charges against the former president stand. Roberts, again the author of the majority opinion, wrote that prosecutors must now show that defendants “impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so.” In the new indictment, Smith’s team has done just that. When describing the actual events of the Jan. 6 attack, the new version adds in more details about Congress’ work that day to certify the Electoral College’s votes, focusing on the documents that the rioters threatened after breaching the Capitol. With that shift, the prosecution now also highlights the timing of the attack and its aim of disrupting the vote count. “At approximately 1:11 p.m., the Vice President opened the certificates of vote and certificates of ascertainment that the legitimate electors for the state of Arizona had mailed to Washington, consistent with the [Electoral Count Act],” the indictment now reads. Two paragraphs later, having noted that Trump was back in the White House watching events unfold, the prosecution describes the Capitol being breached and forcing the Senate to recess. “At approximately 2:20 p.m., the official proceeding having been interrupted, staffers evacuating from the Senate carried with them the electors’ certificates of vote and their governors’ certificates of ascertainment,” Smith wrote. The superseding indictment is not guaranteed to kickstart the trial, which was originally scheduled to begin this past March. There are still several elements that will require Chutkan to rule on whether they can be included in his arguments. Trump’s lawyers are most likely to object to the prosecution’s references to his conversations with Pence, arguing that those discussions were within the scope of his office. But they may wind up throwing whatever they can into their filing to attempt to delay the proceedings further. And, thanks to the vagueness of the immunity test that Roberts put forward, whatever ruling Chutkan makes will likely be appealed. The matter may even make its way back up to the Supreme Court, as I predicted previously, giving the conservative justices another chance to cover for Trump. But Smith has done a lot of the heavy lifting to ensure that, should Trump lose in November, this case can continue forward into the next administration."
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.28.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-82824-rcna168613,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the local mayoral race won’t be decided until the fall, but the two finalists for the office to emerge from this week’s primary are both Democrats, which means the party will flip the office from “red” to “blue.” * In Donald Trump’s latest interview with Phil McGraw (TV’s “Dr. Phil”), the former president said: “I guarantee you, if Jesus came down and was the vote counter, I would win California.” The GOP candidate lost the Golden State four years ago by roughly 29 points, and Republicans have presented no evidence of election irregularities in the state. * As debate negotiations continue, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said in a statement: “Both candidates have publicly made clear their willingness to debate with unmuted mics for the duration of the debate to fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates — but it appears Donald Trump is letting his handlers overrule him. Sad!” * In Ohio’s closely watched U.S. Senate race, Republican Bernie Moreno’s past as a car dealer has been mocked and scrutinized, but NBC News reports that he’s nevertheless returning to the industry. Despite claims that he’s sold off all of his companies, the GOP candidate is investing millions in two ventures that are developing a new car dealership. * Several Democratic strategists are launching a new super PAC focused specifically on “election protection and battles that could come after Election Day.” The effort will be called Democracy Defenders, and it’ll be led by Jim Messina, who was Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager. * Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign is over, but the independent conspiracy theorist ended his candidacy too late to be removed from ballots in some states, including Michigan and Wisconsin. * And a new $10 million ad campaign from Building America’s Future and Americans for Consumer Protection will apparently try to discourage Black voters from supporting Harris, who’d be the nation’s first Black woman to serve as president. The attack ads will reportedly focus on battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin."
The brutal reality of Trump's mass deportation plan needs to be discussed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mass-deportation-plan-rcna168431,"Donald Trump still loves a border wall, so much so that he’ll even do a photo-op in front of one built during his predecessor Barack Obama’s administration. But as a policy promise and a symbol of what can be expected from a future Trump presidency, the wall has been replaced in favor of a program of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. The organizers of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month even printed signs reading “MASS DEPORTATION NOW!” for delegates to wave with glee. The idea has an understandable if vulgar appeal: If people are here illegally, just make them leave. If that’s unpleasant for them, it’s no more than they deserve for violating immigration laws. But if we consider what would be involved in mass deportation, it becomes clear that Trump is promising something that’s shocking in its brutality, overwhelming in its logistical challenge and unprecedented — not only in American history, but in the history of the world.  On NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday, host Kristen Welker asked Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, about the millions of families of mixed status, in which at least one parent is undocumented but a spouse or a child is a legal resident or a citizen. Would families simply be broken up? After dodging the question a few times while claiming he was eager to answer it, Vance finally said, “I think you of course have a number of children who are currently living with drug cartel members, not actually their families.” That’s not exactly reassuring to those families that a Trump administration would treat them as something other than criminals. Asked the same question about family separation three days before, Trump said only, “We’ll work on that,” which means he hasn’t given it any thought. As for how the mass deportation of undocumented people would work, he offered a predictably simple-minded explanation: “We’ll work with locals — and they’re going to bring them to us — and we’ll get them over the border, and we’ll make arrangements with the countries, and the countries will accept them back, and if they don’t accept them back, we do no trade with those countries, and we charge them big tariffs.” Bada-bing, bada-boom. All taken care of.  When Trump talks about mass deportation, he speaks as if every undocumented immigrant’s name and address are on a list and law enforcement can just knock on their doors and politely remove them. But the reality is far different. The most widely accepted number for the undocumented population is 11 million, though that is an approximation (Trump and other Republicans claim it’s twice as high or more). How is the government going to find and remove 11 million people if it doesn’t know who they are? Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws within the interior of the country, made 416,000 arrests last year; the agency clearly doesn’t have anything near the resources to arrest 26 times as many people. In fact, according to FBI statistics, every law enforcement agency in America — every police department and sheriff’s department, every state police troop, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and so on — combine to make about 10 million arrests per year. So even if you recruited every law enforcement official in the country to this effort, you’d be doubling their workload, and they still wouldn’t reach every undocumented resident.  Trump says he wants to deploy the military to do the job. And how would that work? Would soldiers descend on states and cities with large immigrant populations and go house to house demanding that everyone show their papers? I can remember when Republicans were the ones warning about “jack-booted government thugs” deploying “Gestapo tactics.” They might show up at workplaces where they suspect significant numbers of undocumented people are working, but such raids are usually rare and planned far in advance. Once they line up, say, a hundred workers outside a factory, how would those workers prove their legal status? A birth certificate or a passport is necessary to prove citizenship, and how many people take one of those documents to work every day? Would the military just arrest everyone with an accent and sort them out later? Legal residents and U.S. citizens would inevitably be wrongly arrested in huge numbers before they could prove their status, if they ever did, in what would be unlikely to be a smoothly run operation (this is a Trump enterprise, don’t forget). And where would you put the millions who’d been rounded up while this process of figuring out who is and isn’t a legal resident played out? Ghoulish Trump adviser Stephen Miller envisions vast camps near the southern border; just imagine dumping people there by the hundreds of thousands at a time and what it would take to provide food, shelter and sanitation for them.   Immigrants, including those who are undocumented, live in almost every state, county and city in America. Arresting this many of them would be chaotic, terrifying and often violent. Think of how you’d react if someone busted into your house and tried to take members of your family away. Basic civil rights would be violated on a scale unprecedented in American history. About 120,000 Japanese Americans were placed in internment camps during World War II, a program we now properly regard as abominable, and that was about one-one hundredth of the size of what Trump proposes.  In fact, no country has ever removed 11 million people from within its territory; to find roundups on anything even approaching that scale, you have to look to the history of genocide in places such as Germany and Cambodia.  That’s not to mention the economic consequences of mass deportation. Like it or not, undocumented people not only do critical work in a variety of industries including farming, construction and food production; they also pay billions of dollars in taxes every year. As one recent review of economic literature on the subject concluded, mass deportation “would shrink the U.S. economy, cause American workers to lose jobs, reduce the wages of U.S. citizens, lose the taxes paid by deported unauthorized immigrants and worsen the finances of federal, state and local governments.” Trump’s mass deportation plan is his most consequential economic promise, far more than cutting taxes or increasing tariffs, and it would be an economic disaster.  Perhaps Trump’s mass deportation would be akin to his promise to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it: something that was never going to happen the way he described it but which thrilled his supporters all the same. They love to imagine Trump snapping his fingers like Thanos and making all the undocumented immigrants disappear, without muss or fuss. Yet for all his rancid white nationalism, Trump couldn’t make immigrants disappear, as hard as he tried. This is still a country where immigrants are an essential part of our economic and cultural life, just as they have always been. We can’t know whether Trump believes what he says, but his people are certainly acting like they’re serious. “Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” his former ICE director Tom Homan said in July. “They ain’t seen s--- yet. Wait until 2025.” Even if Trump can’t accomplish what he promises, he’s likely at the very least to attempt some form of it. And we all ought to be afraid."
Republicans' latest attack line against Tim Walz: His dog?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tim-walz-dog-scout-conspiracy-republicans-rcna168498,"Conservatives looking to damage Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz tried out a bizarre new attack by making wild claims about ... his dog Scout. The claim stems from a post on X with two images of Walz and a dog. Walz mentions Scout in both photos, though the dogs are different. But one of the images is from a 2022 outing at a park, where Walz is seen playing with other dogs, according to a video he posted on Instagram at the time. The original post appears to be an attempt at trolling by a Republican strategist based in Minnesota. But Republicans ran with it. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called Walz “an all-time legendary liar” in a now-deleted post on X. Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.'s fiancée, accused Walz of “lying about his dog.” Even Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri shared it. The disingenuous attack is part of the right's efforts to discredit the Minnesota governor, often by exaggerating or making false claims about what he's done. So far, the attacks that Republicans have leveled against Walz include: The sheer number of attacks shows that Walz's critics have not yet found an effective strategy for attacking him despite closely scrutinizing his record. Contrast that with the backlash that Donald Trump's running mate has faced. Sen. JD Vance's resurfaced remarks about “childless cat ladies"" went viral and sparked intense criticism, as did his foreword for a book by a major Project 2025 figure. More recently, his awkward attempt at making small talk with employees at a donut store has been mocked. The problem for Walz's critics is that most Americans genuinely like him, as opposed to how they feel about Vance."
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calls out immunity ruling as contrary to a system that 'treated everyone the same',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ketanji-brown-jackson-immunity-ruling-trump-rcna168578,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent in Trump v. United States called out clearly her Republican-appointed colleagues’ broad grant of criminal immunity to Donald Trump. So even though she didn’t offer an entirely new sentiment during a new television interview, it was nonetheless striking to see and hear the Supreme Court justice express displeasure with the July 1 ruling.  In an excerpted clip of that CBS interview posted on Tuesday, occasioned by Jackson’s forthcoming memoir, when asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell if she was concerned about broad immunity, the Joe Biden appointee replied: “I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same.”  Putting aside all sorts of problems in the criminal system having nothing to do with Trump — of which Jackson, a former public defender, is likely well-aware — her comments took on even greater significance in the context of special counsel Jack Smith’s filing a superseding indictment Tuesday in the federal election interference case. The new indictment, which seeks to comport with the Roberts Court’s new immunity test, served as its own reminder of how far the GOP-appointed majority has gone to help Trump. Jackson’s remarks underscore that reality.  The justice may have yet another opportunity to weigh in officially on the case. The high court sent it back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan and tasked the trial judge with applying the new, vague test to Trump’s prosecution. It’s unclear when or how Chutkan will rule, but the justices can review her work yet again before any trial can go forward. Such review is unlikely to occur before November’s presidential election, and as regular readers know, if Trump wins that election, he’ll find himself in the best circumstances possible for a criminal defendant: gaining the power to get rid of the case himself.

Vance’s rhetorical record on people without kids gets even worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 8:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-rhetorical-record-people-kids-worse-families-election-2024-rcna168597,"It’s been about six weeks since Donald Trump tapped Sen. JD Vance as his new running mate, and the rollout for the Ohio Republican hasn’t exactly been smooth. In fact, there’s quantifiable evidence that much of the public just doesn’t like the young senator — and his standing hasn’t improved since he became a candidate for national office. There are different explanations for Vance’s unpopularity, but it seems likely that his lengthy record of condemning Americans without children has contributed to his troubles. Unfortunately for the GOP ticket, that record is still growing. NBC News reported: “You know, so many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they’re people without kids, trying to brainwash the minds of our children,” Vance said at a forum in October 2021, about a year before he was elected to office for the first time. He added, in reference to the AFT leader, “If she wants to brainwash and destroy the mind of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.” Such ugly language would be controversial on its own, but it's made vastly worse by the totality of his record. As we’ve discussed, during Vance’s first campaign, the then-candidate appeared on Fox News and diagnosed what he saw as a crisis plaguing the United States. The country, Vance told a national television audience, was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It’s just a basic fact.” The future senator specifically included Vice President Kamala Harris — who has stepchildren, but no biological children of her own — in his societal condemnation. What’s more, CNN uncovered related comments from November 2020, when Vance said on a podcast that childless Americans, especially those in the country’s “leadership class,” were “more sociopathic” than those with children and made the country “less mentally stable.” The Republican went on to say that in his experience, the “most deranged” and “most psychotic” people he sees on social media were also typically childless. Alas, we can keep going. Media Matters, for example, uncovered several additional Fox interviews in which Vance lashed out at “childless” Democrats. Media Matters also found a Breitbart news interview in which the Ohioan claimed that the left’s “next generation leaders,” including “the Kamala Harrises, they don’t have kids. And so there’s this weird way where they want to take our kids and brainwash them so that their ideas continue to exist in the next generation.”  There’s also been extensive reporting of late about Vance suggesting that parents should have greater voting rights than Americans without children, and federal tax policies should “punish” those without children for their “bad” choices. Mother Jones’ David Corn, meanwhile, uncovered a speech in which Vance said he receives unflattering media coverage because he thinks most journalists are “childless adults.” HuffPost added a report of its own, shining a light on comments the Republican senator made in 2021 about the need to “go to war” against the idea that women can decide not to have children, suggesting that someone who focuses on building their career instead of making babies will be “a sad, lonely, pathetic person.” About a month ago, Trump told Fox News that he’d encourage voters concerned about Vance to “listen to his words.” The trouble, of course, is that whenever people do listen to Vance’s words, his problems get worse. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"The worst part of Trump’s reaction to new, superseding indictment",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/worst-part-trumps-reaction-new-superseding-indictment-rcna168587,"It was about a year ago when Donald Trump was initially indicted over his efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat. It’s a case that was delayed by a series of procedural appeals, culminating in a scandalous U.S. Supreme Court ruling that, to a radical degree, elevates the American presidency above the law. That ruling, of course, was issued by Republican-appointed justices last month. This month, as my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained, special counsel Jack Smith and his team decided it was time for a new indictment related to the same underlying crimes. In other words, the GOP nominee is still being charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, but the charges are now being presented in such a way as to accommodate the Republican-appointed justices’ opinion. “The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions,” the special counsel’s office said in the filing. For the most part, the criminal defendant responded as expected. Trump began, for example, by turning to his donors, seeking a reward for the grand jury’s findings. (The subject line in the appeal: “I was just indicted again!”) The Republican has long tested the “crime doesn’t pay” adage, and it was hardly surprising to see him do so again. Around the same time, the former president turned to his social media platform to issue a furious tirade about the charges, Smith, and the efforts to hold him accountable. Trump then issued another such statement. Then another. And then another. About an hour later, however, Trump rolled out a different kind of complaint. “It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election — but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote. “Voting starts on September 6th, therefore the DOJ has violated its own policy — Election Interference.” So, a couple of things. First, Election Day 2024 is 69 days away. Yes, some states allow early voting that will begin much sooner, but Trump’s attempted “gotcha” probably won’t amount to much. Indeed, as Lawfare's Anna Bower explained, prosecutors explained in a March court hearing that the judge that the “60-day rule” does not apply to cases like Trump’s ""that have already been charged and are now in the hands of the judicial system.""  Second, it’s kind of hilarious to see the Republican take a sudden interest in a DOJ rule he was eager to ignore four years ago. In October 2020 — 30 days before Election Day, with early voting already underway across much of the country — Trump publicly called on federal prosecutors to charge Joe Biden, accusing him of undefined crimes. In fact, on Oct. 7, 2020 — 31 days before Election Day — Politico published an especially memorable headline: “‘Where are all of the arrests?’: Trump demands Barr lock up his foes.” The next day, the then-Republican incumbent spoke with Fox Business and called on the Justice Department to “indict” his perceived Democratic foes — including Biden. In other words, when Smith’s office issues a superseding indictment 70 days before Election Day 2024, before early voting begins in any state, Trump sees it as proof of “election interference” and a violation of Justice Department policy. But when Trump was in office, he nevertheless expected the DOJ to charge his Democratic opponent with made-up crimes much closer to Election Day 2020. How does the former president explain the contradiction? So far, by ignoring it."
