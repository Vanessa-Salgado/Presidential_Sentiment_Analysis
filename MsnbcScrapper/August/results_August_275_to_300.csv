A 12-foot statue of Rep. John Lewis stands where Confederate monument used to be,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 1:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/john-lewis-statue-confederate-monument-georgia-courthouse-rcna167027,"A bronze statue of the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis has been erected outside the DeKalb County Courthouse in Georgia, replacing a Confederate monument that stood there for 112 years. Standing 12 feet tall, the statue of Lewis was created by sculptor Basil Watson. It was installed on Friday and will be officially unveiled on Aug. 24. An obelisk commemorating the Confederacy had been on the site from 1908 to 2020. For years, the Beacon Hill Black Alliance for Human Rights, a local group advocating for Black residents in Decatur, had campaigned for the obelisk’s removal, but state law prevented the local government from doing so. In 2019, the group successfully pushed for a plaque to be placed nearby to provide context for the monument. The plaque read: As racial justice protests swept the country in 2020 and local governments and institutions in the South reassessed their tributes to the Confederacy, a DeKalb County judge ordered the obelisk’s removal, saying it had “become a public nuisance.” More than 100 Confederate monuments were removed that year, a study found. A task force created shortly after was assigned to oversee replacing the Confederate monument with one honoring Lewis. A leader of the Civil Rights Movement, Lewis represented the Atlanta area in the House from the time he was first elected in 1986. In an interview with The Washington Post one month before his death, he told Black Lives Matter protesters, “You must be able and prepared to give until you cannot give any more.” Lewis died in July 2020 at 80 years old after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, he was one of the most prominent members of the House and the longest-serving member of the Congressional Black Caucus."
JD Vance points to ‘Gangs of New York’ to back up claim that immigration leads to crime,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 11:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-gangs-of-new-york-deportation-crime-rcna167012,"Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, defended his past comments on immigration by pointing to the 2002 Martin Scorsese movie “Gangs of New York” as an example of immigration leading to higher crime rates. At a campaign appearance at the Milwaukee Police Association on Friday, Vance was asked about his comments in 2021 in which he claimed past waves of immigration led to increased crime, and if he thought mass deportations — a major part of the Trump-Vance campaign platform — would have addressed those issues. The Ohio senator responded by referencing the 2002 film in which an Irish man, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, exacts revenge for his father’s death by infiltrating a violent anti-immigrant gang in the mid-19th century. “Has anybody ever seen the movie ‘Gangs of New York’? That’s what I’m talking about,” Vance said. “We know that when we have these massive ethnic enclaves form in our country, it can sometimes lead to higher crime rates.” He later added: “What happens when you have massive amounts of illegal immigration, it actually starts to create ethnic conflict, it creates higher crime rates. We’ve certainly seen that over the last few years.” Vance’s reference to “Gangs of New York” as evidence for his racist assertion about immigrants calls into question his comprehension of the movie. As Washington Post columnist Philip Bump pointed out on X, “the most brutal, vicious killer in that movie is the nativist who loathes immigrants.” But Vance’s claim is wrong about the real world as well: A slew of studies have shown that there is no significant link between immigration and crime. In fact, research has repeatedly shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Michael Light, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has published a paper on the subject, told Reuters in April, “Of course, foreign-born individuals have committed crimes. But do foreign-born individuals commit crime at a disproportionately higher rate than native-born individuals? The answer is pretty conclusively no.” Yet cases of violent crime committed by migrants gain widespread national attention, in no small part due to fearmongering about migrants taking jobs from Americans and committing crimes — one of Trump’s long-standing claims. Vance has struggled greatly to boost Trump’s candidacy. Although many of his past remarks on women have led to particularly intense backlash as they resurface, Vance has also made several comments in recent weeks — including on Friday — that have done very little to help the situation or improve his popularity. Polls indicate that he has not made a good impression on Americans so far, with his unfavorable ratings increasing by more than 9% since he was chosen as the GOP nominee’s running mate."
House Oversight Chair James Comer opens investigation into Tim Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 9:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/james-comer-tim-walz-china-house-oversight-rcna167001,"After many failed attempts to advance their impeachment probe into President Joe Biden, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are shifting to a new target: Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz. Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., on Friday announced an investigation into Walz’s ties with China, asking FBI Director Christopher Wray for information about the Minnesota Democrat’s dealings with the country. Comer wrote in his letter: Comer also claimed that Walz has had “problematic engagement” with Chinese “entities” that is antithetical to the effort to “identify and defeat CCP unrestricted warfare against America.” A spokesperson for Walz told The Washington Post, “Republicans are twisting basic facts and desperately lying to distract from the Trump-Vance agenda: praising dictators, and sending American jobs to China.” Walz’s personal relationship to China is well-documented. He spent a year teaching English in Foshan in southern China, arriving shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre. For nearly a decade into the early 2000s, he and his wife, Gwen Walz, arranged educational visits to China for high school students. Walz has said that he’s traveled to the country around 30 times, including for his honeymoon. Yet Walz has taken positions that would not have endeared him to the Chinese government. As a member of Congress, he met with Tibetan leaders and Chinese dissidents, and he served on a congressional commission that tracks human rights abuses in China. In 2017, he co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act; Jeffrey Ngo, a senior policy and research fellow at the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, credited its passage years later to Walz’s early support. Despite interest from the Chinese public in Walz’s history with their country, some experts on Chinese politics have said it’s unlikely that the relationship between Washington, D.C., and Beijing would ease even if he and Harris take the White House. Still, Walz’s approach to U.S. relations with China is arguably more nuanced than many American politicians’. “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,” Walz said in a 2016 interview. As Donald Trump and his campaign struggle to find an effective point of attack against Walz, Republicans are seizing on an opportunity to portray the governor’s history with China as something suspicious. With the Oversight Committee’s investigation, Comer, who as committee chair has a history of partisan investigations into Trump opponents, now takes it up a notch."
I’m a cancer survivor. Nassau County’s mask ban is a threat to my life.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 7:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nassau-county-bans-masks-endangers-vulnerable-residents-rcna166981,"On Thursday, officials in Nassau County, New York, where I live, signed a mask ban into law, one of the first of its kind in the country. And while to most healthy adults it doesn’t mean much, to those with serious health conditions, like me, it makes getting out into the world a lot harder. The ban was touted by lawmakers as a public safety measure after reported antisemitic incidents and protests at various New York universities, many involving people wearing masks. Those who violate the new law face a misdemeanor charge punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. And while there are exemptions for people with religious and medical reasons, it’s not dealing with the law that I’m afraid of. It’s dealing with the “citizen cops” of the world who will be using their discretion to enforce it. I was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in February 2023. It’s a fast-growing type of blood cancer. I underwent more than five rounds of chemotherapy, and the following July, thanks to an amazingly generous donor, I had a stem cell transplant, something I knew nothing about until I got sick. I was given some of the most powerful chemotherapies to kill my old immune system and any remaining cancer cells. Then I was given my donor’s stem cells to help build a brand-new immune system. There are a lot of risks that come along with the transplant, especially in the early stages as the stem cells are engrafting and you have no immune system. The first 100 days are the riskiest, and you must watch everything from what you eat to how it’s prepared, and most of all the people around you. Your body is starting from scratch, so you have almost no immunities. Any vaccinations you’ve had over your lifetime have been wiped out. For the last year since my transplant, my immune system has slowly been getting stronger. But building a new immune system takes years, and I have a long way to go. So, wearing my face mask whenever I go out is essential. That brings me back to the new law. I wear a medic alert bracelet and would hope that showing it to the police, should it ever become an issue, would be enough. But that’s not guaranteed, because anyone can just order one. Would I be forced to show up in court to prove my medical condition to a judge? And what cost and time could that take, all to protect my health? And what about my family or people who act as caregivers, who don’t technically have medical conditions of their own, but still wear masks to protect me? Would there be an exemption for them? Most of all, I worry about those who have strong feelings against masks. As we know, many people read headlines and not always the full story. And just reading most of the headlines, all someone will know is that there’s a mask ban in Nassau County. Even at the height of my illness, with no hair and really looking like I had cancer, I still got comments like “Covid is over” or “that’s not protecting you.” And while the few comments hurt, especially while I was battling for my life, I could shake them off. I had a bigger fight ahead of me. Now, healthier with hair again and 43 years old, the comments continue. But I worry that in this current political climate and with the new law, it may not end at that. People can’t see my disability from the outside. It’s been hard to get back out in the world, as many can relate to after going through a global pandemic. Even being as careful as I am and just starting to let my guard down a little in outdoor settings, I caught Covid. And it took my body and immune system down hard. Luckily, I’m recovering and back to wearing my mask diligently, even outdoors. I want to be able to return to my normal life. And go out with friends, see a Broadway show, and one day get back to my office in the city. But now with New York City considering passing its own mask ban, I don’t know when I would feel safe enough to do that. Is this law really protecting the masses?"
University of Florida students expose ex-President Ben Sasse's alleged spending spree,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ben-sasse-university-of-florida-expenses-desantis-rcna166943,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 16 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Remember Ben Sasse? The Republican senator from Nebraska was first elected back in 2014. He made a show of not voting for Donald Trump in 2016 and fashioned himself as something of a Trump critic within the party.  Despite that, during his time in the Senate, he voted for the then-president’s agenda anyway — passing his tax cuts and voting to declare a “national emergency” so Trump could divert money from the military to build his border wall. Sasse voted against hearing from witnesses in Trump’s first impeachment and was among the 52 Republican senators who acquitted the ex-president. When he faced a primary challenge in 2020, Sasse even scored an endorsement from Trump, the man he once compared to the white supremacist David Duke. The senator went on to win re-election. But, less than two years into his second term, he resigned to take a job as president of the University of Florida. Then, in July, just 18 months after taking that job, Sasse announced his resignation. He cited his wife’s ongoing medical struggles, including a recent epilepsy diagnosis.  On Monday, the university’s student newspaper, The Independent Florida Alligator, published a report about Sasse’s short tenure as UF president.  According to documents obtained by the Alligator, which have not been seen or independently verified by NBC News, Sasse hired a number of his old Senate staffers and allies to highly paid positions at the university. Some even worked “remotely” from Washington, D.C.  The paper also reported that spending by the office of the president more than tripled during Sasse’s first year at the University of Florida. According to the Alligator, the school’s previous president, Kent Fuchs, spent $5.6 million during his final year with the university. In Sasse’s first year as president, he spent $17.3 million. Travel spending also reportedly skyrocketed under Sasse. Fuch’s yearly average travel spending was just $28,000. Sasse’s office spent more than 20x that amount, totaling $633,000 in his first fiscal year with the school. NBC News reached out to the University of Florida but has not heard back. The university told the Alligator that “Sasse’s budget expansion went through the ‘appropriate approval process.’” On Friday, in a statement posted to X, Sasse responded to the report, saying it was “not true” and that there was no “inappropriate spending"" during his time as president: The chief financial officer for the state of Florida has now called on the University of Florida to conduct an investigation into what he referred to as Sasse’s “exorbitant spending.” The DeSantis administration also says it’s been talking with the university’s leadership about it. “We take the stewardship of state funds very seriously and have already been in discussions with leadership at the university and with the (state university system’s) Board of Governors to look into the matter,” DeSantis spokesperson Bryan Griffin said in a statement.

Why Kamala Harris' DNC will be different,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-democratic-convention-different-rcna166960,"I spent the day in Chicago on Thursday at the United Center, where the Democratic National Convention will be held next week. And while there will still be lots of speeches and plenty of balloons, I can already tell the event is going to feel different from past conventions. Here are three examples: This November, Arizona voters will decide on a constitutional amendment known as Proposition 139 that would ensure abortion care access up until fetal viability, or around the 24th week of pregnancy. And the proposition already has a lot of support within the state. Over 577,000 signatures were collected to put it on the ballot, the most ever for an Arizona initiative. According to a CBS poll from May, 65% of likely Arizona voters already say they support abortion being kept legal in all or most cases. Proposition 139 could also have a big impact on voter turnout. As Donald Trump brags about overturning Roe, this initiative has the potential to energize Democratic voters, with consequences for the presidential race as well as Arizona’s pivotal Senate contest between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake. Moore has been a powerhouse in Democratic politics for decades. She served as the director of White House political affairs under President Bill Clinton, was a key adviser to Biden during the historic Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, and played a pivotal role in securing Harris’ spot on Biden’s 2020 ticket. Now, Moore is taking on another critical role: managing this year’s Democratic National Convention in her hometown. A Chicago native, Moore got her start in politics as an organizer for the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign. She later became a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. As chair of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Moore brings decades of experience and deep roots. My sit-down interview with her will air this Sunday. Best known for her role as Kate Harper, deputy national security advisor on “The West Wing,” Mary McCormack is an accomplished actor, producer and dedicated social justice advocate. Recently, she co-authored the book “What’s Next,” which she describes as “a love letter to The West Wing, the people behind it, and the fans who cherished it.” We’re thrilled to have her join us on the show this Sunday, alongside Martin Sheen. What show are you bingeing right now? “Veep” on HBO. What’s the last book you read? “Devil in White City” by Eric Larsen. What time do you wake up on the weekends? Too early. 7 a.m. How do you take your coffee? With a little bit of cream."
Elon Musk was right to tell E.U. regulators to buzz off,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-x-trump-eu-regulators-censorship-rcna166619,"At least a million people listened to Elon Musk’s conversation with former President Donald Trump live on X this past Monday. A private citizen engaging a powerful politician in a dialogue is a critical element of American free speech. Unlike most of the rest of the world, our system is built on the belief that more nonviolent speech — the good, the bad and the ugly — is the way we settle our differences and make decisions in our democracy. And whatever your politics, this is a good and normal thing — freedom is messy and such conversations are protected by the Constitution, no matter how truthful, misleading, hateful or valuable the conversation was to listeners. Americans should celebrate our expansive view of expression and encourage more of these conversations in our society. But that’s not how Thierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for internal markets felt. Prior to the interview, Breton sent Musk a letter (which he also posted on X) in which he felt “compelled to remind” Musk that large American tech companies are required to comply with a series of rules and regulations under the sprawling auspices of the Digital Services Act (DSA). Right after making a perfunctory aside to say that free expression is important, Breton warned that X is responsible for failing to take appropriate “mitigation measures … regarding the amplification of harmful content.” To be clear: “mitigation measures” means removing, demoting, limiting how content can be shared or searched for, or otherwise suppressing speech that “promotes hatred, disorder, incitement to violence, or certain instances of disinformation” as it is “considered illegal, according to national and/or EU law.” Breton essentially threatened X with legal action if it failed to censor the Trump conversation to the satisfaction of E.U. bureaucrats. This is a full-throated attack on free speech in an American election. While Musk has occasionally been an inconsistent champion of free speech rights, he was clearly right to move ahead with his interview. How American businesses react to European threats will shape how everyone engages with the online world in the future. It is worth reading Breton’s letter for yourself to understand just how dangerous and brazen this act of attempted censorship by the E.U. is. It’s also a helpful demonstration of how the edicts put out by authorities in Brussels don’t just stay in Europe — they can have major implications for how American tech companies operate, what kinds of speech are allowed online and even how election campaigns are run in the U.S. The E.U., via Breton, argued for the widespread suppression of a major American political discussion on X because they assert it may be illegal in E.U. member countries. While social media companies can and often do “geoblock” content so that it can’t be viewed in certain countries in response to legal demands from authorities, the idea that X users would not be able to tune in to a discussion with an American presidential candidate — because the E.U. says so — is more akin to the Great Firewall of China or other totalitarian efforts to limit what users can find online. But Breton did not stop there, as he helpfully reminded Musk that X is already being prosecuted under the DSA for not sufficiently following E.U. rules. And since this interview with Trump was livestreamed to users in the E.U., Brussels was “monitoring” for content that might “incite violence, hate, and racism.” Thus, “any negative impact of illegal content ... may be relevant in the context of the ongoing proceedings.” Nothing says “do what we want” quite like “and if you don’t, we will use it against you in our court of law where we are the judge, the jury, and the executioner and can penalize you by seizing up to 6% of your global sales.” U.S. citizens and American companies are increasingly affected by the rules written in Brussels — the so-called “Brussels effect.” Every company has to decide if their new product or new content moderation policy complies with a vast array of E.U. laws. Many companies will decide to simply create products and policies that comport with E.U. rules, even when offered to Americans. For example, the recent massive IT outage was so widespread in part because of an E.U. requirement that forced Microsoft to give CrowdStrike broad access to Windows. Other companies will deal with this through the costly complication of having significantly different products and business practices for different regions or by launching only some of their products in some locations. For example, in the past month, Meta and Apple both announced that they will not be releasing some of their new features in the E.U. because of concerns over the DSA. The censorial threat from Breton clearly extends the Brussels effect into American speech and elections. This is a demand from the E.U. to suppress core political speech regarding a U.S. election under penalty of law that could have major implications for Musk, X, Trump’s candidacy, American voters and Europeans who want to observe or be part of the conversation. It is worth remembering that such censorship is a double-edged sword. Consider this entirely plausible hypothetical: E.U. right-wing parties further build on their electoral gains and win a majority in the next E.U. election. They could easily turn the E.U.’s censorship arsenal against American progressives — issuing such warnings to social media companies when Democratic politicians speak online, declaring pro-Palestinian activists to be terrorists, or censoring pro-immigration groups as a threat to Europe. Rather than let American companies, users and expression be abused by E.U. diktats, the American government should be diplomatically pushing back to protect its citizens and their rights. And as evidenced by large tech companies already withholding their newest products from the E.U., it also may be only a matter of time before these companies simply walk away from Europe and its crippling and censorial regulations."

Why arresting Matthew Perry's alleged drug suppliers won't solve anything,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/matthew-perry-drug-charges-ketamine-death-rcna166959,"If you’ve ever seen a newborn bird or mouse, their skin is so thin it’s translucent. It’s difficult to imagine the vulnerability of such a creature, so new to the world. They need constant protection. Any exposure might kill them. When the drugs are gone, addicts have no skin. We are that vulnerable. Our eyes stay shut tight, as even the sunlight hurts. If Matthew Perry was like me, and I think he was, he couldn’t survive the world without help. He was just as vulnerable. As I read the contents of his toxicology report, I thought, He just hurt too much. We don’t feel vulnerable to drugs, but to feeling. We can’t stand it after being numb so long. On Thursday, news broke that five people, including Perry’s assistant and doctors, were charged with providing him the ketamine that led to his accidental overdose in 2023. “They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great danger to Mr. Perry,” proclaimed U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada. “But they did it anyways. In the end, these defendants were more interested in profiting off of Mr. Perry than caring for his well being.” It enraged me. I understand why charging these people may seem like a good idea. Text messages between two of the doctors indeed show a deep callousness toward Perry, whom they refer to as “a moron” as they speculate about their potential payday. But the false narratives surrounding addiction in our nation keep us sick. Arresting Perry’s suppliers is not a solution to addiction. It’s smoke and mirrors; a PR tactic meant to convince Americans our government is doing something about the problem. The truth is addiction is a terrible and mysterious disorder of the brain. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Heath Ledger, Prince, Whitney Houston and Matthew Perry did not survive it. Inexplicably, I did — so far. I’ve been off heroin for many years. But if I were to overdose tomorrow, the Drug Enforcement Administration would not be dispatched to investigate. I am not in the public eye and don’t have a fan base. Law enforcement doesn’t need to prove to anyone they’re doing something about my death. I’d be just one more statistic. I also can’t imagine any dealer considering a career change because of these arrests. The market for drugs is like any other, a question of supply and demand. If the five people who helped Perry procure drugs hadn’t come through, he would have found five others who would. He had the money to do so. Not everyone does. Addiction is a medical issue, not a moral one. What does “justice” look like? Arresting a doctor here or a personal assistant there? This sort of targeted prosecution is the flimsiest of Band-Aids. It implies the matter has been closed, and it enables society to bypass our responsibility — both to Perry and to each other. How do we convince the American people to invest in evidence-based drug treatments for addicts when other patients can’t get the basic health coverage they need? France cut heroin overdoses by almost 80%, a stunning success rate. But it has health care for all and centers devoted to not just getting addicts off drugs, but also to providing therapy and job training. There’s another aspect of this tragedy that is difficult to convey, and even more difficult to accept. And that is the notion of what is and isn’t help. I’ve been dope sick before, and it’s a hell I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Perry asked his longtime live-in assistant for relief; according to court documents, the assistant administered three injections of ketamine between 8:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on the day of the actor’s death. I can’t imagine Perry wanting that assistant punished for fulfilling his requests. (And of course, now we’ll never be able to ask.) I don’t expect everyone to understand an impulse that isn’t rational. But for addicts, help is often only one thing: more of what kills us. If we lived in a nation that recognized addiction as the disorder of the brain it is proven to be; if we provided medical support not just to addicts, but to all Americans; and if we finally gave up the yoke of puritanism and accepted the medical science surrounding addiction treatment, I might say: Go ahead. Arrest the dealers. But we do not live in such a nation. When our government cracked down on doctors for overprescribing with no other solutions in place, some addicts looked for relief on the streets. Some killed themselves. People in chronic pain were stranded. Illegal fentanyl killed hundreds of thousands. Should Kamala Harris become our next president, I hope she has the wherewithal to rewrite our addiction policy. In the meantime, the men and women who fed Perry’s addiction will go to jail — probably. Perry’s assistant has already pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death. The public’s thirst for revenge may be slaked temporarily. But nothing else will change."
Why Kimberly Cheatle’s journey from Secret Service director to protectee isn’t shocking,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 6:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kimberly-cheatle-protected-by-secret-service-rcna166980,"Tonight, NBC News’ Kelly O’Donnell reported that former U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has become U.S. Secret Service protectee Kimberly Cheatle. That’s because Cheatle, who resigned from her post on July 23, has become the target of unspecified, but presumably credible and significant, threats in the wake of the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and the Secret Service’s failure to prevent it. But as shocking as it is to see a former Secret Service director need the protection of her own former agency, it’s much less surprising when one considers the overall threat environment facing those whom Trump loyalists perceive as a danger to him — or them. After all, we learned earlier this week that the daughter of Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw Trump’s New York hush money trial, and her business partner have each been subjected to death threats and harassment, and that law enforcement has advised the daughter and her family to leave their home for their own safety. Further, in an interview with my NBC News colleague Ken Dilanian last month, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted that the Justice Department has brought 400 cases over the last two years alone dealing with threats against federal and state judges, federal and state prosecutors, federal and state legislators, and federal, state and local law enforcement officers. Of course, those are just the cases federal law enforcement has brought, not the totality of the threats. And several of those cases concern targeted people who, simply for doing their jobs, have raised Trump supporters’ ire. They become part of the online stew of conspiracy theories, misogyny, white supremacy and MAGA devotion that can catalyze grievances into threats — or worse. Take Spencer Gear, a 32-year-old Nevada man indicted last month. The Justice Department alleges that from November 2023 through July 2024, Gear made threats to injure or kill 11 federal or state officials, including five federal judges in Washington, D.C., and Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over both of E. Jean Carroll’s defamation trials against Trump. According to that indictment, Gear also directed threats, via a June 3 voicemail, at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the 34-count felony hush money case against Trump, as well as against Merchan. To be fair, neither the fact of Gear’s indictment nor the identities of his alleged targets is new. But the transcript of Gear’s bail hearing, which MSNBC has obtained, includes the government’s description of how resolute, methodical and unafraid those making the threats can be, even when warned by federal law enforcement, as officials say Gear was, that the types of messages he had been leaving for officials were not protected by the First Amendment. According to that transcript, prosecutors say days after a Manhattan jury returned its verdict in the hush money case, Gear left a voicemail message at Bragg’s Harlem office in which he claimed, “We’re at war now,” and then, referencing Bragg and Merchan, warned, “You’re dead men, we’re going to kill you ... we’re going to round you up, and we’re going to put you before our own court, and then we’re going to f---ing execute you.” Prosecutors played that voicemail for the court in arguing that Gear should not be free pending trial. Gear was equally bold even when the FBI came to arrest him, authorities say, initially refusing to leave his house and cutting his hand while throwing back a drone the agency flew into the house. By the time FBI was able to conduct a search, agents found not only “multiple firearms throughout the house,” but also a “tactical vest that had a significant amount of ammunition on it” and “fresh blood — as if he had been handling that tactical vest.” And although he left his home without violence, he told the FBI, “You can smile today because I chose a different path. You’re not the enemy, but you work for them. This organization is not constitutional. I hope you guys understand that.” We obviously don’t — and likely won’t — know the nature of the threats to Cheatle. But if even one of the people making those threats is as unrepentant and potentially prepared as authorities say Spencer Gear was, her rapid transformation from political appointee to guardee is perfectly understandable."

Does he want to seek retribution, alongside his antivax buddies, against liberals for daring to try to prevent mass death during the Covid pandemic?” A new report from The Washington Post seems to have landed on a rather simple answer: power and ambition.  Apparently, Kennedy, through an intermediary, sought a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to see if she’d be willing to offer him a role in her potential administration in exchange for his endorsement.  The Harris campaign’s response? Essentially: “boy, bye.” Per the Post:  Kennedy said in response to the report that he had reached out to all the candidates, but never asked the Harris campaign for a Cabinet position. As the Post noted, the cold shoulder Kennedy reportedly received from the Harris campaign was markedly different from the response he received from Trump’s campaign regarding a similar offer. Weeks earlier, Kennedy and Trump spoke directly about the idea of Kennedy endorsing Trump in exchange for a Cabinet position or advisory role in a potential Trump White House. Portions of one of their discussions were even posted online. And though no agreement seems to have been reached, the fact the chats occurred at all highlights a pretty clear contrast. Team Trump seems thirsty for Kennedy’s endorsement, or for him to leave the race at least, and Team Harris doesn’t seem to care either way. Recent polling data show why that may be. As my colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, Harris’ entry into the presidential race has attracted independent and third party voters who’d been considering Kennedy when President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee. On the other hand, Kennedy’s ongoing presence in the race only seems to hurt Trump. So even if they were to meet, Harris could reasonably ask Kennedy: “Why do I need your endorsement when your ‘supporters’ are already flocking to me?” Trump seems acutely aware that Kennedy’s campaign, which has been imploding as of late, seems to be pulling from his support. That would explain his public attack on conspiratorial podcaster Joe Rogan after Rogan praised Kennedy’s campaign. I’d argue all of this puts Kennedy in a prime position to extract some kind of concession from Trump down the line. He clearly has something Trump wants, whether that’s a suspension of his campaign or a full-on endorsement. And Trump has shown shameless deference to people willing who aid his campaign in any way."

Leaked videos show how Trump’s allies plan to equate abortion with murder,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 1:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-training-videos-abortion-trump-rcna166924,"The more that Donald Trump and his campaign try to distance themselves from the authoritarian ambitions of Project 2025, the more revelations emerge about how tightly linked they are. Videos of the Project’s Presidential Administration Academy, recently obtained by the investigative reporting outlet ProPublica, provide even more damning evidence of how former Trump administration officials plan to carry out their agenda in a possible second term — and how abortion is one of their key targets. ProPublica published 14 previously secret videos produced by the Heritage Foundation to train future administration appointees. Two of these videos in particular show that despite Trump’s gaslighting of the public that he has “moderated” on abortion, his Project 2025 allies are plotting multiple ways to attack it. Project 2025 lays out multiple anti-abortion plans, including revoking Food and Drug Administration approval of the abortion medication mifepristone and using the Comstock Act as a means of instituting a national abortion ban by criminally prosecuting the sale of abortion pills through the mail. These videos show how Trump’s allies also plan to radically reshape the federal government to elevate anti-abortion activists and even equate abortion with murder. In the section “Coalition Building,” Paul Teller, a former special assistant to the president and a senior aide in the Office of the Vice President, and Sarah Makin, a former deputy assistant to the president and former director of outreach in the Office of the Vice President, discuss the importance of building relationships with outside advocacy groups to advance the administration’s agenda, particularly on “pro-life” issues. Makin highlighted her role in planning a Rose Garden event during which Trump addressed the annual March for Life remotely. For optimal “optics,” she reached out to “an umbrella organization for pregnancy centers” to arrange a group of people to stand behind Trump. She lauded that “we had moms and their babies, babies who’d been rescued from abortion by these pregnancy centers come and stand behind the president.” (The comments start around the 11:15 mark.) Pregnancy centers, sometimes called crisis pregnancy centers, are “facilities that represent themselves as legitimate reproductive health care clinics providing care for pregnant people but actually aim to dissuade people from accessing certain types of reproductive health care, including abortion care and even contraceptive options,” according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. They often use “false and misleading information, emotional manipulation, and delays.” In the segment titled “Left-Wing Code Words and Language,” Katie Sullivan, former acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, and Bethany Kozma, deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration, devoted more than 45 minutes to vilifying Democratic programs to combat climate change, promote equity and advance LGBTQ and reproductive rights as a diabolical leftist plot to control peoples’ lives, akin to rule under Stalin or Hitler. The pair discussed their experiences as “part of a coordinated effort in the Trump administration focused on trying to take back hijacked language and definitions across the United States government.” The left, Kozma claimed, “got very creative years ago and started using different words to make abortion sound a little less like murder,” using instead phrases like sexual and reproductive health or reproductive rights. Sullivan added, “it’s incredible how the left is able to make killing children and babies a ‘pro’ movement."" Sullivan promised the video would teach trainees “how to identify the left’s progressive language,” “how to scrutinize career staff compositions for dangerous language,” and “how to combat their manipulative efforts, ensuring clarity of definition and conservative intention.” Sullivan also said that “you can do this in any role at any level of seniority.” Although Trump pandered to the anti-abortion movement during his first term, and stacked the Supreme Court with the conservative majority that overturned Roe, it’s clear he is now terrified that the Dobbs decision is an albatross around his neck — and that all the attention on Project 2025 is a perpetual reminder of his allies’ radical goals. Last month, Trump clumsily tried to claim in a Truth Social post, “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it” and “I have nothing to do with them.” But Trump can’t beat the truth with misdirection. At least 140 Project 2025 contributors, including those featured in the training videos, previously worked in his administration. In 2022, Trump flew to a Heritage Foundation conference on the organization’s private plane, with the organization’s president, Kevin Roberts, to deliver a speech. In the speech, Trump said, “They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.” Rolling Stone reported that just before publishing his bogus denial on Truth Social, “Trump had been privately — and very bitterly — complaining about the abortion policies laid out in the lengthy Project 2025 manifesto, and trashing the Project 2025-linked ‘lunatics’ who keep demanding unpopular abortion bans and restrictions.” Trump is keenly aware of polling data showing that, as public awareness of Project 2025 has skyrocketed, voters have recoiled from it. Trump can try to run, but he can’t hide from his closest allies’ plans to turn America into a dystopia where abortion is criminalized, and his loyalists wield power to police and censor even any discussion of it at the highest levels of government."
Oklahoma doesn't want to execute Richard Glossip. The Supreme Court might force it anyway.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 1:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/richard-glossip-execution-supreme-court-oklahoma-death-row-rcna166928,"A brief filed at the Supreme Court this week argues that a state court decision ordering an execution “was riddled with errors from start to finish.” Notably, that brief wasn’t filed by the death row prisoner, Richard Glossip, but by the state of Oklahoma, which, in a remarkable turn of events, is practically begging not to execute him. The state has admitted prosecutorial misconduct in keeping key evidence from the jury in securing Glossip’s conviction. But the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals didn’t think much of the government’s plea, instead reasoning in April of last year that the admission “cannot overcome the limitations on successive post-conviction review.”  Glossip, who has maintained his innocence, then asked the justices to stay to his execution. With the state supporting his request, the high court did so in May of last year. Yet, instead of summarily ordering a new trial like the state asked for — “so that justice can be done in this case,” the state said — the Supreme Court appointed a third party to defend the state court ruling. It’s not unprecedented for the court to appoint a third party to argue an abandoned position, but the implications of the justices potentially upholding the state court ruling here are extraordinary. “The [Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals] had no valid basis to order Oklahoma to execute Richard Glossip over the objection of the State’s chief law officer,” the state argued in its latest brief to the justices. In another notable feature of the case, Oklahoma is represented by top conservative Supreme Court lawyer Paul Clement, who’s also representing former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in his bid to move his Georgia state criminal charges to federal court.  “When the prosecution takes the extraordinary step of confessing error in criminal cases, courts are obliged to take the confession seriously, not apply procedural obstacles the State has waived,” Oklahoma’s brief said, adding: “That is particularly true in capital cases, and doubly so when the confessed error involves prosecutorial misconduct.” The oral argument is set for Oct. 9, during the first week of the court’s upcoming term. The hearing may provide a sense of where the court stands, ahead of a ruling expected by July 2025. In yet another noteworthy aspect of the dispute, Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case, presumably because he previously sat on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Oklahoma and thus some of Glossip’s prior litigation. While Gorsuch has sided with certain criminal defendants in cases where his Republican-appointed colleagues haven’t, he has routinely ruled against capital defendants.

Judge suspended after putting a teen in handcuffs for sleeping in court during a field trip,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/detroit-judge-teen-handcuffs-sleeping-kenneth-king-rcna166921,"A judge in Detroit has been suspended after he ordered a teenage girl to be handcuffed and threatened her with jail after she fell asleep in his courtroom during a field trip. District Court Judge Kenneth King was temporarily removed from the docket after an internal investigation and will “undergo the necessary training to address the underlying issues that contributed to this incident,” Chief Judge William McConico said in a statement Thursday. The 15-year-old girl was in King's courtroom Tuesday as part of a group trip organized by the Greening of Detroit, a local nonprofit organization, to help young people learn about the judicial process. A now-deleted YouTube video showed the girl falling asleep between hearings, when King yelled at her and ordered her to be put in handcuffs and to change into a Wayne County Jail jumpsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported. Colleen Robar, a representative for the Greening of Detroit, said in a statement Tuesday that the judge “chose to make an example of a 15-year-old girl in front of her peers,” calling his punishment “unacceptable.” The girl’s mother told NBC News that her daughter was tired because they don’t have permanent housing and that they had arrived late at the place they were staying the night before the trip. She told the Free Press: “My daughter is hurt. She is feeling scared.”  King’s excessively punitive reaction to the teen falling asleep has been widely condemned. He told WXYZ-TV on Tuesday that he was not so much “disturbed” by her falling asleep but by her “whole attitude and her whole disposition.” “That’s not something that normally happens. But I felt compelled to do it because I didn’t like the child’s attitude,” King told the local outlet. “I haven’t been disrespected like that in a very long time.”"
Trump's New Jersey news conference was just another act of self-sabotage,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 11:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-economy-message-republicans-inflation-rcna166935,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 15 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" On Thursday, Donald Trump held a news conference at his New Jersey golf club. The event was somewhat of a do-over for Trump's 90-minute rambling speech in North Carolina on Wednesday, where he was supposed to tout his economic proposals. The campaign did its best to set the scene — laying out a spread of groceries and posters claiming to show the “Price Increases since Kamala Harris took office.” That was the message Republicans and aides wanted Trump to stick to. Instead, what you saw was a man who is incapable and completely uninterested in staying on message.  It was Trump being Trump. It wasn’t as much a news conference as it was a rambling stream of grievances, insults, fabrications and gibberish. And that’s pretty much all we’ve gotten from Trump over the last few weeks. I don’t see any indication that’s going to change. The campaign is trying desperately to make him talk about the economy but Trump just can’t bring himself to do it. It's also worth noting that, for a guy who’s supposed to be a successful businessman, his ignorance of basic economics is kind of jaw-dropping. I’m interested to hear, whether on the record or off the record, the reaction from Republicans. I wonder if they saw that performance Thursday and thought: What are we going to do with this guy? Do we really want to put him back in the Oval Office? Where is he taking us?  Well, I think that’s pretty clear by now."
"To scare voters, Trump is making up claims about migrants finding jobs",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 11:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-immigration-rhetoric-crime-rcna166930,"Donald Trump held another meandering press event on Thursday, filled with all kinds of dubious claims.  One claim that's earned him particular criticism was his allegation that more than 100 percent of new job creation has gone to immigrants. That immigrants are purportedly siphoning jobs away from nonimmigrant Americans — which is demonstrably false, by the way — has become a common refrain in his 2024 campaign. The latest iteration was outlandish, even by his standards: Journalists have already debunked right-wing misinformation attributing job growth under the Biden administration entirely to immigrants getting jobs. Mathematically, though, Trump's statement is not even possible — another sign of Trump’s ongoing struggle with grade school-level concepts. And it’s also a sign of desperation. Trump launched his political career with a speech full of bigoted lies about immigrants — whom he painted broadly as rapists and ne’er-do-wells — being sent to the United States. I'd argue his racist and xenophobic portrayals of immigrants have gotten even more surreal since then, particularly in the current election cycle. This year, Trump has called migrants “animals” and “not people” in speeches, accusing them of ""poisoning the blood of our country.” In recent speeches, he’s routinely referred to serial killer Hannibal Lecter, attempting to associate the fictional character — who was held in a mental asylum — with immigrants who seek asylum in the U.S. So his made-up stat about immigrants somehow accounting for more than 100 percent of job growth is yet another tale he’s telling to sow fear and hate toward immigrants.  It’s noteworthy that Trump’s increasingly dehumanizing xenophobia comes as actual data about immigration and crime also shows him to be increasingly wrong. Border crossings decreased for the fifth consecutive month in July, reaching the lowest level recorded since fall of 2020, when Trump was president. In fact, the number of border crossings has been so low that NBC News reports Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has struggled to find enough immigrants to use in his cruel publicity stunt of busing asylum-seekers across the country. And violent crime, which Trump associates with immigration — despite data that shows immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born citizens — has declined at ""historic"" rates under the Biden-Harris administration.  This data exposes how Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric has been increasingly disconnected from reality of late. The facts simply aren’t on Trump’s side when it comes to the nightmarish scenes he paints for the public. To quote Trump-aligned rapper French Montana, “when the hate don’t work, they start telling lies.”"
This tech founder launched an elite VC firm after being told venture capital was ‘a young man’s game’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 11:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/tech-founder-launched-elite-vc-firm-told-venture-capital-was-young-man-rcna166934,"If you ask Silicon Valley tech veteran Miriam Rivera about the greatest influence on her path to success, the answer might surprise you: “Sesame Street.” Born to Puerto Rican parents in upstate New York, Rivera relied on Headstart and the iconic PBS show to learn English. “I spoke Spanish first,” she told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. “Sesame Street was really one of the ways that my parents helped me learn English and get ready for school.” Today, she sits on the Sesame’s board of directors, but that’s not her primary job. After receiving a JD-MBA from Stanford University, Rivera joined Google in 2001 as the tech giant’s second attorney, moving up the ranks as vice president and deputy general counsel before leaving in 2006. Now, she is the cofounder and CEO of Ulu Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm that specializes in early-stage investment of startups that might appear to be longshots but are ultimately very profitable. Rivera, 60, made Forbes and Know Your Value’s 4th annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list this month, for her accomplishments in the investment category. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. Since she founded the VC firm in 2008 with her husband Clint Korver, Ulu Ventures has consistently punched above its weight, managing $400 million in assets with a portfolio that includes ten current or recently-exited unicorns, including data startup Palantir, Guild Education, and fintech company, SoFi. They key to the firm’s success — and its primary focus — has been strategically funding founders from underrepresented backgrounds. “We did that by identifying talented people who were trying to pursue really big markets and also many of them want to do something that supports a positive social end,” Rivera told McGrath. “We looked particularly for teams that had diverse members, because there’s a lot of data that showed in public companies, diverse board members could actually generate greater profitability, and that’s what has turned out over the last 15 years to also be true of startup companies.” Rivera’s intuitive investment philosophy stems from her own family’s journey, watching her mother and father build a life from scratch. “My parents started off as migrant farmworkers, they moved from Puerto Rico to Florida, then they would work the crops between Florida and New York State,” she told McGrath. “A lot of the times lawyers have the worst hours of anyone … they say that they’re even worse than doctors these days. And my sense of that is nobody really works as hard as migrant farmworkers — so I knew that I was really blessed to be able to do the kind of work that I have done, both as an attorney and as a venture capitalist.” Rivera’s goal of seeding underdog startups and turning them into unicorns speaks to the persistent underrepresentation of women, especially women of color, in venture capital, where women-led companies still only receive about 2 percent of VC dollars. “Obviously women represent over 50 percent of the population [and] over 60 percent of the educated population in the United States,” she said. “That’s an example of how extreme the change is needed in terms of trying to increase representation in business. And it’s not going to happen with people who are opposed to investing in the most educated and the best.” It’s a bias Rivera knows all too well on her path to becoming a VC founder. “When I first started to raise capital for Ulu Ventures, I asked an experienced venture capitalist for a referral to a limited partner, which is an investor who invests professionally in venture firms,” she told McGrath. “And he told me that venture capital was a young man’s game — I was really left astounded because I’d served on a board with this person, but he dismissed me out of hand.” It wasn’t the first time Rivera overcame bias. Years earlier, she experienced similar discrimination as a new mother when she cofounder her first company. “I had my daughter on Friday, I went back to work on Monday, and a few months later I was told that by a director, if it were his grandchild, he’d prefer the mother to stay home,” she recalled. “I was asked to leave my firm and that’s partly because a new set of venture capitalists were coming in, and they did not want a husband-wife team — my husband and I were cofounders at the time of this startup — I certainly felt that it was a bias against working women, and certainly marital status bias.” Today, her resilience and persistence has paid off. Ulu Ventures is one of the largest, if not the largest, Latina-led firms in the country. Rivera considers the company her greatest over 50 achievement and has this to advice for women looking to succeed in the industry. “I think it’s really important for people to identify a place where they will be given a fair shot, and to find the right investors and the right supporters,” she said. “If you don’t do that, I don’t think you can build a great career.”"

Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday morning, August 13th. I don’t want the summer to go, but okay, here we are. Mary McCord: Although I could do without the heat, honestly, so that’s the only good thing. Andrew Weissmann: So I’m in the mountains where it’s in the 50s at night and it’s in the 70s during the day. And this is like a hill station where pre-air conditioning people would come up here to cool off. And you know what? It works. Mary McCord: Yeah, I’m surprised it still works though, because a lot of places that don’t have air conditioning are now realizing that doesn’t work anymore. Well, I’m the opposite. I’m in North Carolina on Topsail Island. Actually, today is pretty temperate, but it has been hot. Andrew Weissmann: So I don’t think we’ve mentioned who we are. So if you are a new listener -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- which we love to “Prosecuting Donald Trump,” I am Andrew Weissmann and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Mary McCord: Good morning. Andrew Weissmann: So before we get started, I wanted to mention to people something that we at “Prosecuting Donald Trump” and the fabulous team here started actually this past Monday, is that there is a new way to listen to our podcast.

Mary McCord: And speaking of all of that, we have a new bonus episode that is out and available now. I think it came out yesterday for premium subscribers. And in that new bonus episode, which we recorded last week, my colleague at Georgetown Law, Steve Vladeck, and a real constitutional law expert and Supreme Court expert, perhaps more importantly, he joined us to talk about President Biden’s proposed Supreme Court reforms, as well as just other issues having to do with Supreme Court reform. Andrew Weissmann: So if you’re interested, consider subscribing to MSNBC Premium. That’s what it’s called, MSNBC Premium on Apple Podcasts right from your phone or whatever device you’re listening on, so you don’t miss anything. So, Mary, what are we going to talk about today for free? Mary McCord: Right. That’s right. We have really a potpourri today. I mean, we are going to start off with the biggest news probably since last week, which was Jack Smith filing in the January 6th case in D.C., filing a motion to extend the time to file that joint status report, which would have been due last Friday, August the 9th, and saying, we need more time to propose the court’s next steps. And we’ll talk a little bit about the ramifications of that, why that might have happened, et cetera. And then we’ll kind of hit everything else going on. We have got a change in the schedule in the Manhattan case due to Mr. Trump filing a second renewed recusal motion with Judge Merchan and Judge Merchan rejiggering some of the scheduling to accommodate ruling on that before he rules on a motion to just overturn the verdict or vacate the verdict of the jury based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. We’ll give a slight update in what’s going on in Georgia and also the Florida appeal schedule. And then we’re going to get to listener questions again. So that’ll be quite amazing, two weeks in a row to hit some listener questions, and hopefully we’ll be able to keep doing that for a while. Andrew Weissmann: I love it. So should we turn first to the Jack Smith filing? It was a joint filing. In other words, both sides agreed to it, but it clearly was the impetus was Jack Smith saying, I need three more weeks, and the judge granted that. So the schedule got put off. And I thought it might be a good thing to start with what exactly Jack Smith said, because it is useful to start with what is the stated reason? Because knowing these people, like don’t think too hard. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: They give the reason. They tell the judge a couple of things that I found really interesting. They said, just to be clear, the special counsel is a part of the Department of Justice and that means that the Department of Justice has equities and can weigh in and that the special counsel has to consult with various other parts of the department. In this situation, it’s about the Supreme Court immunity decision, which has huge ramifications for all sorts of parts of the department, the criminal division, the national security division, the tax division, the environmental division. Mary McCord: Civil rights division. I mean, one of the charged crimes is a civil rights crime. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Civil rights and the civil division. I mean, there’s a number of parts of the department, and they just said that is a process that we have got to engage in. A little note to self is, although this is coming in the D.C. case, it kind of is like a backhanded swipe and reminder to how wrong Judge Cannon is, because it’s saying the special counsel, you might think that we’re totally independent and as she wrote, a private actor who’s been given these powers. And this basically says, we’re not a private actor. We’re embedded in the Department of Justice. I have to say, I’ve said this repeatedly, but when I was in Special Counsel Mueller’s team, I’ve never been more compliant with all of the DOJ rules. And we could not bring, as we talked about before, Mary. I would have needed your permission to bring national security division charges, the Foreign Agents Registration Act charges. We needed tax division authority. So he basically said, we just need time for that consultation process to be completed and that should take three weeks. Donald Trump, of course, agreed because it’s delay. I should also point out just so people understand, Jack Smith, this is, I think, the first time he has actually sought a delay and I think almost any case. I mean, he has been very, very sort of pressing and opposing delays in all sorts of cases. And so with a joint application like this, Judge Chutkan, it was not surprising that she would grant it. Mary McCord: Right. And in fact, what she did is she granted, and this was the request, that the joint status report that was supposed to be due August 9th is now due August 30th. That was the date proposed by Jack Smith, again, in a joint filing. So Mr. Trump’s attorneys agreed to that. And the status conference that was scheduled for August 16th, which would be this Friday, this is where we had expected that she would actually then talk to the parties about their filing that was due last Friday, originally due last Friday. That has now been postponed till September 5th. You may recall as well that when she required the parties to file a joint status report agreeing to things, if possible, on August 9th, she said, you know, you can note any disagreements. And we kind of chuckled about that last week, thinking, oh, you think there’ll be any disagreements? Because there’s been almost always disagreements between the special counsel’s team and Mr. Trump’s team when it’s come to both scheduling and substance, I’d say, but they were able to agree, obviously, on this motion for an extension. So the same thing would apply when they do file on August 30th. Again, if there are disagreements about what is going to happen going forward. Remember, this is the proposal for how should Judge Chutkan implement the Supreme Court’s immunity decision? How should she decide what’s official and what’s unofficial other than the one thing that the Supreme Court already told her was official and absolutely immune, and that is Mr. Trump’s communications with his own Department of Justice while he was the president. Everything else is up to her to make decisions about. And so, she needs kind of a plan of action. Are we going to have legal briefings? Are we going to have a factual evidentiary hearing or what some people have called a mini trial? And then if we’re doing all those things, what are going to be the dates for those things? So you can imagine that there could be disagreements about not only the approach in terms of legal briefs, factual development, but also the dates. And I can tell you right now, I suspect that Mr. Trump, even if things had not been put off the way they now have been for three weeks, would be arguing that there should be no evidentiary hearing at all before the election because it’s just getting too close to the election. So we will see. And then she will take these things up now on September 5th and either make a scheduling order on September 5th or someday after that, after she hears from the parties. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. And it’ll be interesting, as we’ve noted, whether Donald Trump says, in addition, that there are legal issues that should be decided sort of unrelated for the immunity. Mary McCord: Before the fact. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yes, hundred percent. Andrew Weissmann: Such as the appointment of the special counsel, the issue that Judge Cannon ruled on, as we pointed out, the D.C. Circuit has already ruled on that, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t sort of anticipate this heading up to the Supreme Court as a reason for further delay. The other thing I would keep an eye out for is as we get closer and closer to the election, there’ll be more warranted pressure on the department not to be taking action that could be viewed as political or influencing the election. It’s the so-called 60 or 90 day rule of the department. But what I’m keeping my eye out for is something that Jack Smith said about a month or so ago, which is that there’s nothing that really precludes him from continuing post-election and pre-January 20th from going forward. So I’m going to be interested, depending on what happens in the election, particularly if Kamala Harris were to win, the idea of having the judge at least tentatively schedule something during that interim period. In other words, post-election, but pre-January 20th, so that time period isn’t lost. Obviously, it is a much more precarious thing to take that position if Donald Trump were to win the presidential election, because that’s the period where he would be in a transition and there’s a lot of work to do. And so I think it would be hard-pressed for the court to necessarily go forward with that. I don’t know what you were thinking or what you’re sort of looking for, Mary. Mary McCord: Well, I agree. I think if Trump were to win, it would just be really tough to see the department, you know, going hard and fast to try to get things done before inauguration. And I actually don’t think it could all get done before the inauguration anyway, I mean -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. That’s a practical matter. Mary McCord: -- as a practical matter, very little could get done. And I think, you know, I think there’s a sequencing here, too, because before you can get to it, assuming there’s some aspect of proceedings now that might require factual development. Remember, the Supreme Court said in the immunity decision that with respect to two areas of conduct for which Mr. Trump is charged, there is some factual development required. And that has to do with the pressure on state legislators and state legislatures to basically support the alternate or fraudulent slate of electors for Mr. Trump, who was not certified the victor in those swing states. That pressure on them required some factual development. And also the January 6th events themselves that involved the rally at the Ellipse, really Mr. Trump calling on his supporters to march on the Capitol, calling on them to pressure Mike Pence to count the false electoral slates. All of that, the court said, require some factual development. But there’s still some sequencing here because one part of the Supreme Court’s decision was even for unofficial acts, let’s assume that that fraudulent elector scheme and the allegations regarding January 6th itself are unofficial. Let’s assume Judge Chutkan can determine that. The court, of course, ruled that you can’t use official act evidence to prove unofficial acts. So in terms of the briefing that has to still happen, I think there’s going to be a lot of argument not only about legally what’s official and unofficial for purposes of Mr. Trump being charged with those things, but then there’s going to be a lot of argument about what can even be admitted as evidence with respect to even things that there’s a better argument are unofficial. So it is complicated and I do think that’s also probably part of the delay. I mean, I realize they had something like close to 40 days to come up with a proposal about how to go forward, but I do think that part is also complicated. Most of the reason, though, like you said, Andrew, was what was stated in the motion. The government continues to assess the new precedent set forth last month in the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. United States. And that’s where you and I have been there. And I would say also, in my view, it’s not just the consultation with Criminal Division and Civil Rights and National Security and Civil and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and the Office of the Attorney General. But also my guess is that you could have some internal disputes between the trial team that may be wanting to go faster and the department leadership that is concerned about all these other equities and the precedent they’re establishing and how things that might get decided in this case will impact, which is part of the consultation, which will implicate things like the Civil Rights Division enforcement of civil rights laws like the one that Mr. Trump is charged with, conspiracy to violate voters’ civil rights by overturning the will of the voters. And it’s not uncommon in my experience, back when I was at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, before I went to main Justice, that on those cases where we did have to run things up the flagpole and consult at the highest levels, trial prosecutors are oftentimes pushing to go faster and harder than some of the leadership components in main Justice. I don’t know if that’s your experience, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: Totally. One thousand percent agree. Is it time for an anecdote? Mary McCord: Yes, absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: I was the chief of the criminal division in the Eastern District of New York. Mary, I know you were the chief of the criminal division in D.C. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So one of the things you do is you field lots and lots of intractable problems. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: But there was an ongoing trial. They were in the middle of jury selection and an interesting legal issue came up and the trial team came to my office and it raised a really interesting issue that the judge had raised. And we brought in a very senior, very experienced appellate lawyer into the conversation. She was relatively new to the office, not new to doing appellate work. And so we’re debating this and we’re trying to figure out a way forward. And she said, well, this is great. We’ll research it and we can get back to you in three weeks. And I -- three weeks. Mary McCord: How about tomorrow morning? Andrew Weissmann: No, I was like, we have about three minutes. The trial team is here on a break at lunch. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: They’re going back to court with a jury and a judge who need the answer now. And the appellate lawyer was looking at me like I had like seven heads. And I was like, no, no, no, no, no. Sometimes the necessity to just make a decision -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- is just there. Mary McCord: That is supportable based on your legal training, but maybe you haven’t fully, fully researched, yes. Andrew Weissmann: I used to say at times when I was there, when I was at the head of the criminal division in the Eastern District of New York, it was true when I was at the FBI, whereas the general counsel, sometimes you can get time and it’s important to remember that. But other times it’s the best decision you can make in eight minutes. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: You had 30,000 employees. You had ongoing searches in the field. People had imminent questions. And sometimes you just have to make an answer and have to give a decision. This is one where you could ask for more time and they did. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And there are those important equities. However, I have to say, Mary, I have been the beneficiary in my life of wonderful supervisors. And when Robert Mueller was the head of the FBI, he would, where he saw the need for a decision, he would say, okay, we are going to have a decision on X date. Mary McCord: X date, yes. Andrew Weissmann: And you’re going to plan your lives accordingly, backwards from that. And so, especially with the department where it can be very cumbersome and it’s like moving an oil tanker -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and it’s not as nimble as a little speed boat. It takes somebody like the Bob Mueller approach of stop playing with your food. That was one of his standard -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- phrases to drive something forward. So anyway. Mary McCord: I’m going to stick up for some appellate people because, you know, I was deputy chief appellate before I was chief of criminal. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: And I called my day job being the person to consult with the people in trial and I would drop everything when they would call from trial. And then my night job was actually doing our appellate work. So that was my day. Andrew Weissmann: And, yes, there is nothing better than an appellate lawyer who gets it and can really help you make those decisions that are kind of on the fly and have that deep knowledge. Anyway, Mary. Mary McCord: So, before we break, I do want to say another thing that I at least think that the Department of Justice should be considering, and that is going ahead and indicting the unindicted co-conspirators. As listeners may remember, the indictment charging Donald Trump charges six other co-conspirators, unnamed, but we can fairly easily determine who they are just from the descriptions of them, such as an attorney who spread false claims about election fraud, Rudy Giuliani, an attorney who developed a plan to use Mike Pence to overturn the election results, John Eastman, et cetera. They were not actually indicted. But when you actually call somebody an unindicted co-conspirator, as opposed to just not using that term, when you use that in an indictment, that means the department thinks there is evidence that would support an indictment or else you would not call them a co-conspirator. Andrew Weissmann: Although not necessarily proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Mary McCord: That’s right. Nope, nope, nope. Andrew Weissmann: It could just be by preponderance. Mary McCord: An indictment is about probable cause anyway, right? My point is they’re cautious, wouldn’t you agree, in using that term, unindicted co-conspirator? Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Mary McCord: And so as this case is definitely not going to trial anytime soon, to my mind, it would make sense to consider going ahead and bringing charges against everyone just for purposes of accountability and because things are going to take longer now than they maybe otherwise would have if we hadn’t had this detour to the Supreme Court. And all of that, though, also is going to depend in many ways on the results of the election, because just as we’ve discussed before, that if Mr. Trump wins, he can order his Department of Justice to dismiss the case against him. He can also order it dismissed against others and has, you know, essentially already suggested he would do that with respect to some of the January 6th attackers, also has dangled pardons. So whether this case moves forward depends on a lot of things beyond even just with the legal briefing and factual development in district court lead to. Andrew Weissmann: Well, as you know, Mary, I violently agree with you, but that’s a great segue. So we’re going to take a break, but that’s the reason it’s a good segue is because we’re going to talk about the schedule in New York, in Florida, but in Georgia as well, where there is a big overlap between those federal unindicted co-conspirators and the state Georgia case where those people are indicted defendants. But there’s a precarious position of that case as we’ll get to right after the break. So stay tuned. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. You know, one thing we didn’t just talk about in this sort of opening segment was comments by the current Democratic presidential candidate now. You know, the appropriateness or inappropriateness of commenting on any of these criminal prosecutions. We know that President Biden, generally speaking, with only a few sort of like very small comments, avoided it. And that’s what we’re seeing with Vice President Harris right now, too. In fact, I think we’ve now seen at least, I think, two examples, maybe more of her being at a rally and having people in the crowd start to say something like, lock him up, lock him up. And she has really shut that down. She said, that’s for the courts, right? We’re here to win an election in November. And Andrew and I just thought it would be appropriate to talk for a minute about why that is, why she doesn’t talk more directly about the pending criminal cases. Andrew Weissmann: Sure. And I thought this is important for people because they obviously could look at Donald Trump and his example and be like, well, why isn’t she doing it? Now, that kind of answers itself. Mary McCord: Right, it does. Andrew Weissmann: But it goes back to what you said about President Biden. When he was running and then when he took office, he was very much saying the White House stays out of who gets prosecuted, who doesn’t get prosecuted and commenting on pending criminal matters. If anything, if you were to talk about them, you can jeopardize that criminal matter. It can be raised by the defense in the criminal case to the judge as to why it’s unfair, why there’s bias, why there’s undue pressure on the prosecutors. And so it’s both sort of practical, but also it’s a different philosophy as to how the White House should be and should not be involved. And remember, Vice President Harris is the vice president. So she is at the head of the White House, but for one person. And so she is acting accordingly. And so what you will see is I think she is being very careful about talking about matters that have concluded, where there has been a jury finding or a judge’s finding. So she will talk about a finding of sexual assault. She will talk about a finding of fraud. She will talk about a finding of student fraud. So things that have been found and concluded where she’s not weighing in on a pending matter. And with respect to the pending matters, so the January 6th case, the Georgia case, the Mar-a-Lago case, you do not see her doing that. You see her saying, as you said, Mary, you know what, we’re going to let the courts deal with that. Our job is beating him at the ballot box. And without getting into who you should vote for, which, you know, Mary, you and I really try to studiously avoid. Obviously, we have our views and we have what we think are principles. I think it’s important to note that from our training as former DOJ people, it’s really understandable and it’s more consistent with what we understand to be the proper role of the White House officials in dealing with pending matters. Is that sort of fair in your take as well? Mary McCord: Oh, yes. And part of that is, again, you know, that independence between the Department of Justice and the White House is critical for people to have faith in the prosecutions that the department brings. And it’s something that Donald Trump has tried to eviscerate both by his own wanting to influence, if he’s elected again, the Department of Justice, not influence, but direct it outright. But also his accusations that this current Department of Justice has been weaponized against him and against the J6 attackers and others. And so all the more reason it’s important to keep that separation. But again, this is not constitutionally required. The president is the head of the executive branch. You know, right now, President Biden could direct Merrick Garland to do various prosecutions against various people and drop others. But we, you know, historically and as a matter of norms and adherence to the rule of law and wanting to have the population feel comfortable and that they can rely on the integrity of our governmental institutions, that hasn’t happened. And that includes political commentary during a campaign, not using current ongoing prosecutions as part of that. Now, I want to also note people might have said, well, wait, I thought Mar-a-Lago was dismissed. You called it pending. Well, it’s pending because it’s pending appeal. And in fact, that’s one of the dates coming up. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: The government’s brief in its appeal of Judge Cannon’s dismissal of the Mar-a-Lago case on the grounds that Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed, that brief is due August 27th so we will be able to talk about it in a couple of weeks. Andrew Weissmann: Do you want to briefly talk about the Georgia schedule and what happened there? And then we can go to Manhattan where there’s more to talk about. Mary McCord: Sure. So folks probably know that the Georgia, Fani Willis, that is a state prosecution of Mr. Trump and so many co-conspirators for RICO violations, state law RICO violations, as well as many, many other alleged crimes. That case has been on hold now for many months and it’s on hold pending an appeal by defendants there, Mike Roman, but others have joined that, of the trial court’s not to disqualify Fani Willis on the grounds of an actual conflict. And that was based on her relationship with the special attorney, special prosecutor she had appointed, Nathan Wade. The trial court there found there was no actual conflict of interest, but did find that there was an appearance of impropriety and therefore ordered Fani Willis to either get off of the case, she and her entire team, or Nathan Wade to get off of the case. He promptly resigned and that is what is up on appeal. The argument is being made that actually the trial court judge erred there and should have found an actual conflict, or even if he just found impropriety, should have ordered her disqualified, and that’s what’s currently being briefed. Ms. Willis filed her response just in the last week. It’s a lengthy response. It goes back through the trial court’s factual findings. And, you know, listeners may remember, in terms of whether there was any actual conflict, some of this had to do with when the relationship started, that romantic relationship started. Was it before she appointed him or was it after she appointed him? That was left unresolved by the trial court. But he did find that there really wasn’t any evidence of an actual conflict that she had hired him for her own financial gain, which again goes back, for those who need the reminder, because we have so many cases, was based on these trips that they took together and whether he had paid for them and she had benefited because she was getting to go places like Aruba and Bahamas, et cetera. And the trial court essentially found there was a lot of splitting of expenses here. She paid for some things. He paid for some things. She reimbursed him for certain things. And so there’s no actual conflict. It’s kind of sad to me that this dispute is what is delaying this case on the merits, right? We’ve got important and significant accusations here and whether, you know, each defendant is entitled to due process of law. But this is a very lengthy delay and I believe the appellate court is not actually going to hear it until December, hear argument until December. Andrew Weissmann: I agree with you. I mean, it makes our judicial system compared to other nations look like a laughingstock. The idea as to whether they went Dutch -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- completely 100 percent, that that issue is going to delay holding people legally accountable one way or the other, just to be clear -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- in connection with election interference, in connection with the presidential election, it made it really, I hate to be so flippant, it’s a joke -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- that that would be the issue. Mary McCord: Because when you think about it, Andrew, if the court doesn’t hear this till December, by the time they rule, we’ll be really pushing a year since this issue came up. Andrew Weissmann: By contrast, New York is chugging along. And that is an example of the legal system, I think, working where there has been a trial already. It has been concluded. There is the typical process of post-trial motions. There’s been a little bit of a delay, but not in the date, the September 18th date that the judge set for either a sentencing or some proceeding consistent with his rulings before then. But it could easily be, and I think it will be, a sentencing. That September 18th date, that is still there. What got delayed a bit is there was a motion made, it’s the third one, by Donald Trump to recuse the judge, this time based on the fact that Kamala Harris is now the Democratic nominee. And so there is briefing that happened on that. And the judge said he’s going to issue a decision sometime this week. So what he also said is in connection with the immunity motion, he put that off by a few days as well so that will be decided on September 16th. Mary McCord: But I think it’s also important for folks to know this was requested by Mr. Trump’s team. So when you said the third recusal, that’s because early on in the case, they sought Judge Merchan’s recusal based on his daughter working for a political consulting firm that had had Biden and Harris as clients at various times and had other clients. The judge had denied that, but he had sought the advice of the Judicial Advisory Commission or whatever it is called, something like that in New York, which had said there’s no actual conflict. This is your daughter’s business. Your daughter can engage in her business without it, meaning that you have a conflict. Then there was a first renewed motion for recusal, I think in April of this year, which he denied. So this is now a second renewed motion for recusal, which is why we’re up to three. And the only thing that’s renewed about this is, oh, now Vice President Harris is now the presidential nominee for the Democratic ticket and so that makes this all so much worse. But Mr. Trump’s attorneys did say, will you decide this before you go on to decide immunity? Because obviously they want to have Judge Merchan recuse. They want to see if they can probably take that up to the First Division, which has already denied the appellate First Division in New York, which has already denied an appeal from the first denial of the first recusal motion. I realize that’s a lot of use of the word denial in there. Andrew Weissmann: Denied, denied, denied. Mary McCord: Denied, denied, denied. Right. But at any rate, they’d like to have a different judge on this case. And so they’re trying again. And so Judge Merchan has accommodated by saying, I’ll decide this recusal motion first. I’ll decide it this week. That means I’ll be pushing off my decision on your motion to vacate the jury’s verdict based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. That’s one we talked about extensively a couple of episodes ago. And that decision I’ll make September 16th. And then I want to get to the point where you were just going to when I rudely interrupted you, because I think this is very interesting. He says, please note, this is in Judge Merchan’s letter ruling for the parties and for everyone. The court appearance scheduled for September 18th, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., remains unchanged. We will proceed on that date and time to the imposition of sentence or other proceedings as appropriate. Please keep these dates in mind if you still wish to file a pre-sentence recommendation. And the reason this is so interesting to me is, remember, other proceedings as appropriate could be that if he thinks after he reads all of the briefing on the immunity argument, and actually since we had a last episode, we’ve had the Trump reply brief filed, which doesn’t make any more, frankly, plausible arguments than the ones we discussed about his opening brief. There are some arguments there, but it doesn’t make anything new or different, frankly, other than sort of rehashing what’s already been said. The other proceedings could be if he thinks there needs to be a hearing on some of the evidence that was admitted at trial and whether that was official X evidence that shouldn’t have been admitted, a hearing on anything else. But what’s really interesting is he’s saying, otherwise we’re going to sentencing. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Mary McCord: So if you want to file a sentencing memo, you’ve got to file it. My expectation, Andrew, here’s what I’m expecting, is they’re going to come in, Trump’s attorneys and say, we shouldn’t have to file any sentencing recommendation until we know what your decision is on immunity. What do you think? Andrew Weissmann: So first, I was going to say the body that issued the ethics opinion is the Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics. Mary McCord: Thank you. Andrew Weissmann: It’s a New York body. And so they had already approved this. So just to be clear, everyone should understand, that’s sort of the recusal issue. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It is really frivolous because, as the state said, it’s been litigated already. It’s been decided. There’s nothing new. In fact, Donald Trump had already brought up the Kamala Harris facts -- Mary McCord: Yes. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- so that is something that people should really, I think, not be that concerned about given the prior rulings and the judicial opinions and the appellate rulings. On the issue of immunity, I do think that what is going to happen is there’s now a very short window between the date -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that the judge said he’s going to issue his decision, which is the 16th of September, and the date on which sentencing may occur, which is the 18th. I think that Donald Trump on the 16th is going to be filing all sorts of legal briefs -- Mary McCord: Yup. Andrew Weissmann: -- in New York, and up to and including and be ready to go to the Supreme Court -- Mary McCord: The Supreme Court, yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- trying to stay the sentencing saying that the judge got the immunity issue wrong and there should be a stay of that case and there should be no imposition of sentence. Mary McCord: Of course, you’re assuming that the judge decides a particular way on the immunity issue. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. And so I do think that there is going to be this flurry on the 16th -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- by Donald Trump. Just to be clear on that, I don’t blame a defense lawyer, as long as the arguments are made in good faith. That’s what their job is. Mary McCord: I agree. Andrew Weissmann: But I think everyone should be ready for that as the next step. I also just wanted to say, with respect to their reply brief, one of the reasons that I think that’s so clear is their reply brief, I think, is beautifully written. It, to me, was written by a Supreme Court appellate lawyer. It reads sort of very differently than the trial briefs that I read below. And so it suggests to me that they’re very much thinking about the audience for this going forward. I also thought there were some interesting references. And one thing that I thought was -- Mary McCord: The part about the redaction? Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: Yes. I did too. I was hoping we could talk about that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So there clearly was some evidence, and it’s redacted, meaning that it’s blacked out, referring to evidence heard by the grand jury, not the trial jury, but the grand jury. So clearly there was some evidence related to conversations that Donald Trump appears to have had with some advisor or person while he was president. And so the argument is that that’s official act evidence, and it came before the grand jury and so it tainted the grand jury process. As we talked about in prior shows, it’s a strained argument, but here, at least, there seems to be some evidentiary evidence. It doesn’t seem particularly major. It obviously was not something that came out at trial, because then there wouldn’t be a reason to really redact it in the same way. I did want to say one thing that I thought was really curious. And this is going to be super in the weeds, but I think it might be, Mary, maybe something that really goes to and it appeals to your appellate heart, which is on page six of the brief, the Trump team wants to argue why there was good cause for their not raising this issue. They say they did raise it sufficiently -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- but they also say there was good cause for not raising it. And they cite to a case that says that good cause is shown where there is an intervening Supreme Court decision, and this is their term, upends established decisional law. So when you have new law from the Supreme Court that upends established decisional law, and they say, this is a quote, page six, quote, “that is exactly what happened here.” What I loved about that is, that’s not their argument in the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Their argument in the Supreme Court was like, this is established, and this is implicit, and blah, blah, blah. I mean, this was the Biden administration argument, the Michael Dreeben argument. But I just thought it was just like, what a flip flop on that. Mary McCord: No, I noticed the same thing and paused on that. Andrew Weissmann: I’m learning from you. This is like my appellate antenna are up. Mary McCord: I guess I would generally agree with you. This is written a little bit better. I just don’t think there’s a lot new in here except the revelations from the redacted portion. There have been redacted portions on the original motion and on the D.A. Bragg’s opposition that showed us there had been someone who had testified in the grand jury that had given testimony that Trump is now claiming was official acts testimony and should not have been admitted, even if it was in support of unofficial acts under the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. And that because of that, it tainted even the indictment. So the whole case couldn’t go forward. That’s how this is coming up in this motions, just so that people understand. And I kept thinking, I wonder who that was who testified, and I wonder what they testified about because it’s all redacted. And the reason it’s redacted is grand jury proceedings are secret, generally speaking, and it might have been there were protective orders there or something. I’m not sure. But this is the first time we see, and I think this was probably purposeful, that in the reply, they refer to the person who testified as a White House advisor. And that is the first time we’ve seen that. It’s not just somebody else who maybe was a privy, let’s say, to conversations in the White House who testified about it. They actually call this person a White House advisor. So that’s somewhat revealing and I’m sure there’s lots of speculation about who that was. But the legal implications of this, I think, are, again, we’re back to the fallout from that Supreme Court immunity decision, right? First, you’re at the January 6 case and what’s official and what’s unofficial. Now we’re at the Manhattan case. I think most of us feel like the charges there is all about unofficial conduct. But now it’s about what evidence came in and supported those charges. And now it’s about what evidence came in just at the grand jury in support of the indictment. Because according to Mr. Trump, if the indictment was based on things that were official acts, then you can’t continue with this. So lots of fallout, lots of fallout. It continues. Andrew Weissmann: So, should we take another break and move on to listener questions? Mary McCord: Yes. We should. Andrew Weissmann: Sounds great. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Hey, Mary, listener question time. So this is a question we get a bunch. It relates to something we’re just talking about. And the question from Kathy is, can you please try to explain to us why committing a crime would be considered an official act by a president? But that is a great question because there’s so much common sense. So can you please try to explain to us why committing a crime -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- would be considered an official act by a president? There’s other related things like who decides it, but that’s such a great question because, just so the listener understands, Judge Henderson in the D.C. Circuit basically asked a really similar question. Mary McCord: Yes, that’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, what’s the answer, Mary? Mary McCord: So I mean, it’s really because the Supreme Court told us it could be. That’s the bottom line. Andrew Weissmann: Wait, this is like because I told you so. Mary McCord: Yeah, exactly. Andrew Weissmann: Because it’s, wait, wait, because it’s my house. Mary McCord: Yeah, it’s kind of how it feels, right, like right now in the Supreme Court. So, you know, what the Supreme Court is doing here, remember, this is an immunity decision. It’s not a decision saying that things are not crimes, but it’s saying that there are certain actions and conduct that a president can take. Well, first of all, two categories here. Some things are committed exclusively to the president because they are core constitutional functions of the presidency, and for that, a president is absolutely immune for prosecution, even if the execution of those functions technically violates a criminal law. And one of the problems with that part of the decision is they define these core constitutional functions extremely broadly and going well beyond what the words of the constitution says. Remember, even Michael Dreeben, arguing for the special counsel in the Supreme Court, admitted there would be some things that a president couldn’t be prosecuted for, things like the pardon power that is in the constitution. It’s given to the president. So even though we feel, I think most people would feel like there could be a misuse of that pardon power in a way that potentially could be criminal, that’s something there’s immunity for. Other types of things that are explicitly in the constitution, the president is immune from. But the Supreme Court went farther and said within the outer perimeter of a president’s official acts, there is presumptive immunity from prosecution and a prosecution can only go forward for those things if the government proves that it would pose no dangers to the functions and authority of a president by doing that prosecution. So, okay, that’s my long-winded response about what the Supreme Court said. What does that really mean? What it means is that within certain things, and the Supreme Court told us one of these things, when the president talks to his department of justice, his attorney general, deputy attorney general, assistant attorney generals about investigations and prosecutions, even if he is doing that to try to urge a sham investigation, they use those very words because that’s the allegations of this indictment, that would be immune because it’s within the presidential’s constitutional functions to communicate with his own executive branch. There are other things they didn’t decide would be immune, but the principle remains. If it’s something that’s within this outer perimeter of a president’s official acts, which could involve things like his communications with his own vice president, for example, that’s one of the issues, could potentially even involve things like pressure on state legislators because he’s telling them, communicating to them, I think there was fraud in the election, even if it was bogus, even if it was unsupported, these are the things that the Supreme Court is saying he may, not conclusively, but he may be immune from depending on whether prosecution would pose any danger to the authority and functions of the president. So it is a difficult decision to square with rule of law and the very basis for why we have a criminal code in the United States and in the individual states, which is to, you know, create a deterrent as well as punishment for behavior that society through its laws and statutes has decided is not lawful and is illegal and is deserving of, you know, accountability and holding people accountable. And so it’s not enough to say, and this is the Supreme Court being very clear, it’s not enough to say this behavior violates a criminal statute. It’s got to be behavior that the president is not immune from prosecution for. Andrew Weissmann: Two very, very quick points. One is that the Supreme Court said for the lower court in deciding what is official presidential conduct versus unofficial presidential conduct cannot consider whether it is illegal conduct. And they can’t consider that. Mary McCord: Or the motive behind it either, right? Andrew Weissmann: Also the motive. Mary McCord: The corrupt motive. Andrew Weissmann: One answer to Kathy is that in making a decision between what is official conduct by the president and unofficial, the courts explicitly said you cannot consider whether Congress has rendered that conduct illegal. And the second point is I actually wrote a piece for “Just Security” very much on this issue in case you really want to be nerdy because although I understand this when it gets to true core conduct -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- that’s committed to the president, such as the pardon power. When you’re dealing with other broader actions by the president, for instance, and I’m not going to go through my entire piece for “Just Security,” don’t worry. But if the president is acting pursuant to a congressional statute that gives the president authority to act -- Mary McCord: That’s not his core constitutional powers, and it’s not -- Andrew Weissmann: And also, what would stop Congress from saying, we’re going to give you these powers, but we’re also going to make it a crime if you do X, Y, and Z with them? I mean, in other words, you make that contingent. Mary McCord: They can’t put parameters on it, right? They can’t put requirements on it. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: That just seems nonsensical. And that’s what I wrote about. And it’s possible that that will get narrowed later, and especially if this composition of the Supreme Court changes. Anyway, Kathy, thank you so much for that. It’s such a great, great question. Mary McCord: And to her last part of her question, which is, will this eventually go back to the Supreme Court for them to decide? It certainly could. It depends on what Judge Chutkan does. And then it depends on who wins this election, because the whole case could be over or it could not be over after the election. Okay, let’s go on to one more, which is a great question, particularly given some recent statements made by Mr. Trump. This is from Lauren in Australia. Should Trump lose and decide he doesn’t want to be Defendant Trump anymore? What is stopping him from fleeing the country to, say, Russia, Belarus, or Venezuela and escaping justice that way? Is there anything your criminal justice system can do to prevent that? Andrew Weissmann: So I love that this is from Lauren in Australia. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So welcome, international crowd. I love it. This is very topical, as you said, Mary, because I believe yesterday, Donald Trump, in his discussions with Elon Musk, talked about going to Venezuela to escape prosecution and asking or inviting Mr. Musk to visit. And even if that was facetious, and I’m not saying it is, it’s somewhat remarkable to me when I use the word somewhat, that is facetious. It is remarkable that somebody who used to be the head of our government would be joking about something like that. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: I don’t know about you, but I’ve had defendants flee on me, not very often. It’s not fun. So the process of giving bail is the process by which after a defendant is charged and brought to court, the judge decides whether they can be released and under what conditions they can be released. And it can include things as draconian as home confinement with an ankle bracelet. It can more typically include putting up money or real properties and having co-signers, that is people close to you, who would lose assets and be hurt if you were to flee. And a judge makes that decision after hearing from the pre-sentence people, the defense, the government as to what to do. Sometimes a person is released just on what’s called ROR, on their own recognizance, because the idea is that they’re not a risk of flight or a danger to the community and so you don’t need bail restrictions. So those are ways that the court oversees that process to reduce the risk that somebody would flee. It’s an interesting area because there’s a lot of people who are doing a lot of research on people who are detained rather than being released unnecessarily and there’s a lot of effort and reforms on how bail should be accorded. Obviously, a lot of judges don’t want to be in the position where they’ve released somebody and they flee or something really bad happens, for instance, they were to commit some egregious crime. And so there is a concern about over-deterrence here, sort of over-correcting and there’s a lot of research going on with that. But there are ways to try and prevent people from taking that step. Mary McCord: Can I add two points? Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, absolutely. Mary McCord: One is, one of the common ones is a restriction on travel, including turning in your passport. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. Mary McCord: And I know early on in Mr. Trump’s cases, the government did not ask for restrictions on travel or turning in a passport. And I think partly that’s because he was campaigning and, you know, there are times when defendants, I’ve had this happen in many cases of mine, where they’re not allowed to travel outside their state unless they get permission from the court and things like that. So that is one way. I’ve had cases also where the court has made them turn in their passport. So that’s one way to do it here. This is a different circumstance, although that could change. Conditions of release can be modified. The second is a shameless just plug because of work I do in my day job, unrelated to my “Prosecuting Donald Trump” job. One of the things that ICAP does is brings cash bail reform, class action litigation, saying you should not be holding a person solely on cash bail who cannot afford to pay. So if the only reason they’re being detained pretrial is solely because they can’t afford to pay cash bail, whereas another person who could commit the same crime and has the same criminal history could be released if they can pay cash bail, that’s, in our view, an equal protection violation. So to your point, and we’ve drawn upon a lot of the work of researchers, it doesn’t actually prevent recidivism or anything like that. What it does is oftentimes hurt people, particularly people charged with, you know, nonviolent crimes who then potentially are evicted because they can’t pay their mortgage, because they can’t go to work, because they’re detained, et cetera. And we’ve had prosecutors, including former Department of Justice officials and state prosecutors, both, you know, Republicans and Democrats, all come together many times to say that kind of inequity is not constitutional and is not a good policy. So anyway, my shameless plug. Andrew Weissmann: Final comment, just to foot stomp on something you said, Mary, which is that if Donald Trump were to lose the election, and even if he weren’t, but I think particularly if he were to lose, there is nothing that prevents the government from asking the court to reconsider and change the bail conditions to say, you cannot travel, you have to turn over all passports that you have and -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- to tighten up the restrictions, because at that point, you will have a relatively elderly man facing significant criminal exposure in state and federal court and wanting to prevent that. I should note that this is not the first time Donald Trump has talked about going overseas. He earlier in the campaign talked about going to France and sitting in the south of France, rather than being here in the United States, subject to legal accountability. So it’s something to my mind, it’s clearly something on his mind. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So we’ll stay tuned on that. But these were excellent questions. Mary, it was so fun to talk to you and I know it’s time for you to get back to your day job. Mary McCord: Actually, it’s time for me get to my family vacation.

Trump says civilian Medal of Freedom is 'much better' than Medal of Honor,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-service-members-military-medal-of-honor-rcna166891,"Donald Trump appeared to denigrate service members who were injured or killed in the line of duty once again, as he likened a civilian award to a “better” version of the Medal of Honor at a campaign event on Thursday. At an event on antisemitism at his Bedminster golf club, the former president and presidential candidate was introduced by Miriam Adelson, a powerful financial force in Republican politics and the widow of the late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. As he took the mic, the former president spoke highly of the couple and recalled awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, an act that sparked criticism at the time that Trump was rewarding a donor for their financial support. “That’s the highest award you can get as a civilian. It’s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version,” Trump said, referring to the Medal of Honor, a military award. “It’s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump said. “She gets it, and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal, but she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she got it for — and that’s through committees and everything else.” The GOP presidential nominee's off-the-cuff comments on Thursday follow a pattern of insulting veterans and service members, even as he claims to be a fierce supporter of the military. He has called military leaders “some of the dumbest people I’ve ever met in my life” and minimized potentially traumatic brain injuries among service members. In 2015, he infamously attacked Sen. John McCain for being detained in a North Vietnamese prison, saying he liked ""people who weren’t captured."" He also picked a personal fight with family members of a U.S. soldier who died while serving in Iraq. Trump has also long disputed a report from The Atlantic that he called service members who died in wars “losers” and “suckers,” though his former White House chief of staff John Kelly has confirmed some aspects of it."
Trump's immunity remark could be vindicated by the Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-new-york-sentencing-supreme-court-rcna166886,"Donald Trump kept the fact-checkers busy with his latest public remarks on Thursday. But one of his statements, regarding the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, is worth scrutinizing. Indeed, the statement may turn out to have some truth to it — not due to Trump’s honesty, but rather due to the vague and sweeping nature of the ruling itself. Standing outside of his New Jersey golf club, the GOP presidential nominee said, “As you know, the Supreme Court ruled recently on immunity, and I’m immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with.” Yes, the Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity recently (July 1, to be exact). So far, so good. But that he’s “immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with” is not what the court said in the federal election interference appeal. Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion said that there’s no immunity for unofficial acts, that there’s at least presumptive immunity for official acts, and that there’s absolute immunity for exercising the president’s “core constitutional powers.”   What does all that mean in practice? No one knows precisely, perhaps not even the Republican-appointed majority that laid out that new standard. The high court sent the case back to the trial court to figure it out “in the first instance.” So the extent that Trump’s immunity extends to the acts for which he's being prosecuted is yet to be determined. And whatever U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan decides in the first instance could wind up being vetted by the justices again before that trial can go forward. Of course, if Trump wins the election in November, then this may become legally moot, should he order the DOJ to withdraw his two federal criminal cases. (Special counsel Jack Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the federal classified documents case.) Both the timing and convoluted substance of the Supreme Court ruling, then, could amount to an effective grant of immunity to Trump if he’s able to crush his case before the Roberts Court even articulates more clearly the scope of that immunity. In fact, the ruling’s full effect isn’t even known in his New York criminal fraud case, where he wasn’t charged with official acts and was found guilty before the immunity ruling came out. The issue there stems from another odd feature of Roberts’ ruling, which curbs the use of official acts as evidence to prove guilt of unofficial acts — a point Trump’s lawyers have cited in an attempt to overturn his guilty verdicts prior to sentencing. Judge Juan Merchan in New York is set to rule on Trump’s immunity claim on Sept. 16 and sentence him on Sept. 18 if the immunity issue doesn’t stand in the way. But if Merchan rejects the immunity claim, Trump’s lawyers have signaled their intention to appeal immediately before any sentencing can happen — perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court. In all of Trump’s criminal cases, then, the extent of his immunity is a fact that only a Supreme Court majority can know.

The 7 things Democrats need to do ASAP if they win in November,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 8:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrat-to-do-if-win-november-election-rcna166613,"We've all been there. The electrical outlet in the kitchen that no longer works, the squeaky floorboard, the oily spot on the wall in the basement. You put them on the to-do list and then ... never get around to them. Democrats in Congress have a similar list, but the consequences of their inaction could be much more dramatic: legislative stalemates, democratic backsliding and even economic collapse. It's been clear for a few years that American democracy is in need of repair. While it's tempting to dream about dramatic changes to the Constitution, such as eliminating the Electoral College or reforming the Supreme Court, the reality is that many of the most-needed changes are relatively small and straightforward. In fact, like a homeowner who's avoiding fixing the hallway light as they dream about adding a deck, the fact that these repairs are so mundane is a bit of an obstacle. No one runs for office on updating a dusty old statute. It's much more exciting to propose a constitutional amendment, even if that idea is going nowhere. But checking off some items on this to-do list would help prevent a future catastrophe. Here are seven simple things that Democrats should do: End the filibuster. If Democrats maintain control of the Senate, the first thing they need to do is end the absurd 60-vote threshold to pass laws. They already did away with the filibuster for confirming most federal judges in 2013, and Republicans followed suit in 2017 for Supreme Court justices. It doesn't make sense that passing a law would take more votes than giving someone a lifetime appointment to a job that they can then use to undermine those laws. End the debt ceiling. Even if Democrats win big in November, the odds are high that Republicans will win back a congressional chamber in two years. We've all seen what happens next: Republicans refuse to vote for a routine raising of the debt ceiling, leading to a needless legislative standoff that threatens the world economy. It's long past time to scrap this arbitrary limit, which has just encouraged hostage-taking and pointless brinkmanship. Automatically raise the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage is set by Congress, which only gets around to increasing it every few years. Lawmakers last raised it in 2009, which means it's actually been decreasing in value as inflation has eaten away at it, especially since the pandemic. Social Security benefits are automatically increased each year based on the cost of living. The minimum wage should be as well. Repeal the Comstock Act. This 1873 anti-obscenity law hasn’t been enforced in decades, but recently some conservative activists have sought to revive it to restrict access to abortion medication or even emergency contraception. While this idea hasn’t been tested in courts and certainly won’t be attempted by a Democratic White House, lawmakers should repeal this antiquated law and take that option off the table for good. Limit temporary Cabinet appointments. As president, Donald Trump took advantage of the process for naming acting Cabinet secretaries to circumvent Congress' constitutional role to ""advise and consent"" on appointments. Some of these appointees would not have been confirmed if they had been put up for a vote. Others clearly viewed the temporary appointment as an audition, making them much less likely to stand up to the president. Congress should reform the Vacancies Act. Protect civil servants. Trump also sought new ways to fire people in his administration, signing an executive order in 2020 that would have allowed him to dismiss tens of thousands of federal workers and replace them with loyalists. (One former Republican staffer memorably called those potential replacements “an army of suck-ups."") President Joe Biden repealed that order and sought to add new protections for civil servants, but Congress should pass a law definitively putting this idea to rest. Limit national emergencies. The law allowing presidents to declare national emergencies is in need of updating. Already poorly drafted, it has been reinterpreted and limited by court rulings that allow emergencies to be endlessly renewed. (One issued during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979 is still in place.) Lawmakers from both parties are interested in giving Congress more power to end a national emergency. The list doesn't end here, of course. Congress will also need to consider more serious reforms, including updating voting rights laws, continuing to fight climate change and codifying abortion rights, to mention a few big-ticket items. Those efforts will require serious debate about the best approach and will likely take time and political will to muscle them through. The to-do list, meantime, is much simpler. If Congress makes most of these fixes, voters will hardly notice them. There will be no ribbon-cutting ceremony for updating an old law and no celebratory campaign ads for preventing a future catastrophe. But that can also be a reason for doing them since voters are also unlikely to get upset about them. And one day, when the storm clouds start gathering, they'll be thankful that they got around to fixing that hole in the roof."
Kamala Harris isn’t just listening to workers. She’s sounding like them.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 7:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-walz-campaign-workers-movements-rcna166623,"With its rallies that pack arenas, Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has harnessed an energy that many have compared to Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Polls in battleground states indicate that the dynamics of the presidential race have fundamentally shifted, but skeptics question if the good vibes can last once the vice president starts to detail policy. Is this burst of excitement, they ask, just the momentary enthusiasm of voters surprised by an unexpected transition? When we pay attention to what Harris and Walz have already said, though, it’s clear they have tapped the energy of worker-driven movements that want to create an economy that works for all of us. The good vibes and the economic vision of this campaign are, in fact, deeply connected. A case in point: The concluding line in Harris’ stump speech last week was echoed by cheering crowds in arenas across the nation. “When we fight, we win!” For those of us who have been supporting low-wage worker movements over the past decade, the slogan is familiar. It’s been a standard rallying cry since McDonald’s workers first organized the Fight for 15 in 2013. Since then, it has been used by service worker unions who have organized everyone from Waffle House servers to Dollar General clerks, Amazon warehouse workers, and graduate student workers on university campuses. “When we fight, we win!” as a slogan gives voice to the frustrations of the 135 million poor and low-income Americans who know that, even when they work two and three low-wage jobs, it’s impossible to get ahead. Not in an economy that has tilted to more explicitly favor billionaires over the past half-century. But “When we fight, we win!” also expresses the agency of working people who’ve stood up to their bosses and their anti-union culture in so-called “right to work” states like North Carolina to assert their power and win better wages and working conditions. Here in North Carolina, where Harris is expected to roll out her economic agenda today, we mobilized the same agency through “Moral Mondays,” which, like the McDonald’s workers’ fight, also began in 2013. When we hear Harris say, “We’re not going back!” we hear an echo of our movement’s cry: “Forward together, not one step back!” Based in Durham, the Union of Southern Service Workers has worked in recent years to unite a coalition of low-wage workers who have often been pitted against one another along racial and ideological lines. Black, white and brown workers have challenged the politics of division while also refusing the typical framing of left versus right and liberal versus conservative. There’s nothing “far left” or radical, they insist, about the people deemed “essential” during the pandemic insisting that they should earn enough from a week’s work to take care of themselves and their families. Despite the Senate’s refusal to raise the minimum wage during the Biden administration, the direct action of low-wage worker unions has helped lift 13 million Americans out of low-wage jobs over just the past two years. Service worker unions have harnessed the anger and disappointment that drive so many low-income Americans away from politics, but these workers aren’t just driven by feelings. As they have organized, they have also made proposals about practical changes that could make a difference in their lives. Harris and Walz have already demonstrated that they are listening to organized labor. In Detroit, they met with the United Auto Workers at their union hall and thanked their president, Shawn Fain, who had been on television the weekend before lobbying Harris to choose Walz as her running mate. The UAW understood him to be the most pro-union among her finalists. In Las Vegas, Harris promised to champion a proposed tax exemption for tips alongside her fight to raise the federal minimum wage. On Tuesday, Walz spoke to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and pledged that a Harris-Walz administration would expand the pro-worker policies he has enacted in Minnesota to every state. Republican candidate Donald Trump, who tries to frame his divisive populism as “pro-worker,” claimed Harris stole the “no tax for tips” idea from him. But the concept, which has been developed as a policy proposal by Nevada’s two Democratic senators, originated with the Culinary Workers Union 226. Other tipped workers have advocated for One Fair Wage and won campaigns at the state level to eliminate subminimum wages for tipped workers. The details of policy matter, for sure, but this much is clear: The Harris-Walz campaign is listening to workers as it crafts its economic agenda. And it is already speaking the language of workers movements. In our work to organize poor and low-income Americans through the Poor People’s Campaign, we’ve seen how politicians who embrace the language of fusion movements for economic justice have the power to both tap into the moral concerns that drive millions of Americans and multiply the energy of grassroots organizing. In our new book “White Poverty,” we use data from the past three decades of U.S. elections to argue that infrequent, eligible low-income voters represent the largest potential swing vote in 2024. As we witness the groundswell of enthusiasm for the Harris-Walz ticket, we see more than good vibes. This is a campaign that has already tapped into the hopes of working people who, for decades, haven’t had a fair shot and is promising an agenda that could inspire them to show up for races down the ticket. We look forward to hearing the details, but we can already celebrate what low-income people across the nation see: A worker’s vision for the economy is already at the heart of this campaign."
Trump likes to act tough. Harris is proving her strength.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-tough-guy-act-crime-immigration-rcna166804,"Donald Trump is obsessed with toughness. He praises foreign despots for being strong, calls for police to be rough with suspects and uses blue-collar workers as props at his rallies. But Trump’s tough-guy persona is an act, and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is calling him out on it. Her campaign and its allies are leaning into Harris’ background as a prosecutor, her advocacy in the Senate and her time as vice president to tout her strength. And they’re contrasting this with Trump’s empty rhetoric and record of failure to show that she’s actually the stronger, tougher candidate. Nowhere is this fight more clear than on immigration. During a rambling and glitch-delayed conversation with billionaire Elon Musk this week, Trump leaned into his usual attacks, falsely accusing Harris of serving as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” For starters, that was never her title — and I should know, since I was working for her at the time. I served as Harris’ chief spokesperson when the president asked her to lead diplomatic efforts to tackle the “root causes” of migration. The vice president led these talks with our partners in Mexico and Central America, focusing on new strategies to expand economic opportunities in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. So, who is stronger: the candidate who complains about border crossings before, during and after his presidency or the one who looks to figure out why they’re happening and work with foreign leaders to address the issue? But her record goes even further back. In a Harris-Walz campaign ad titled “Tougher,” a narrator lists her record as a border-state prosecutor. Harris held drug cartels accountable and jailed transnational gang members. The campaign ad also highlights her support for a bipartisan deal deemed the “toughest border control bill in decades.” The ad ends by declaring: “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” Voters should know the truth: Trump’s weaknesses as a leader are part of the reason why Harris can play offense here. Trump sank a conservative-led border deal in hopes it would help him during the presidential election. He prioritizes fearmongering over welcoming tough solutions to fix our nation’s broken immigration system. Another major issue for the “toughness” question is crime, and again, Harris comes out on top. As the vice president has been saying on the campaign trail: As a former prosecutor, she knows Trump’s type. Her campaign has used that experience to frame her as tough on crime and highlight Trump’s own criminal record. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of an elaborate scheme to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. By contrast, Harris is a seasoned prosecutor who convinced juries to convict fraudsters. While Trump works to distort Harris’ record on crime, his supporters embrace his criminality. At his rallies, the MAGA faithful hold up signs with his mug shot with the words “Never Surrender.” Trump also vows to pardon criminals who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The so-called party of law and order wants these violent criminals to run free. Which of these two candidates is tough on crime? Candidates also prove their strength by how they choose to campaign. Sometimes it is about what you show voters, not what you tell them. Trump is holding fewer events this campaign, spending his time on late-night social media attacks and whining about how unfair everything is. Harris is vigorously barnstorming swing states and focusing on voters’ concerns. During her short time at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has managed to define herself before Trump and other Republicans have landed on an effective countermessage. This battle to control the narrative is playing out before one of Harris’ biggest opportunities to sell herself to the American people: next week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Democrats can use this moment in the spotlight to drill down on the stark differences between a Harris presidency and a second Trump term. It is also an opportunity to elevate Harris’ proven track record and counter Trump’s playbook of lies and half-truths. The next 80 days won’t be easy. But I’ve seen the vice president in action, and I believe she’s tough enough to handle them. She is meeting the moment and prepared for the task at hand. After all, running for president is tough — and so is Kamala Harris.

A secret video shows Project 2025 is still at the heart of a potential second Trump term,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-executive-orders-rcna166767,"In one of the least convincing performances this election season, former President Donald Trump has been trying to put daylight between himself and Project 2025, a 920-page manifesto for the next GOP president to follow. He has insisted that he has never heard of the head of the Heritage Foundation, which has spearheaded the conservative initiative. He not only has heard of him — he also flew on a private plane with him in 2022. Trump’s campaign has tried to divert the public’s focus to the much less detailed, but still extreme, official Republican Party platform, and Trump’s frustration with being linked with the retrograde policies was so great that the head of the project was forced to step down. His campaign then issued a statement welcoming what it called reports of the group’s “demise.” But one of the people who would almost certainly be tapped to implement Project 2025 should Trump win is apparently unconcerned. In a newly released video from a British journalism nonprofit organization, Russell Vought makes it clear that it’s full steam ahead. They’re stilling plan to make their dystopia vision for America a reality. Vought admitted as much in a conversation secretly recorded in a Washington hotel room last month. Unbeknownst to him, the two men he was meeting with were an undercover journalist and a paid actor from the United Kingdom’s Centre for Climate Reporting pretending to be relatives of a wealthy American donor. In the extremely candid chat that followed, as reported by CNN, Vought revealed just how much Project 2025 legwork has already been done: What a perfect summary of the danger of Project 2025 and why the prospect of a second Trump administration shouldn’t be taken lightly. For months after Trump’s January 2017 inauguration, there was absolute chaos as his inexperienced staff struggled to work the levers of power. The executive order to put his promised “Muslim travel ban” into effect was quickly enjoined in federal court, prompting numerous rewrites to pass legal muster. It took three tries before the Supreme Court allowed a much-revised version to be put into place in 2018. Vought’s claim that he and his team are drafting policy documents now speaks volumes about how different January 2025 could be. Vought’s is a name that longtime readers will recognize. He served in the Trump administration, rising to become the head of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Since then, he and other MAGA B-listers have joined forces at the Center for Renewing America, feeding Republicans in Congress some of their most unpopular ideas and least effective strategies. As such, Vought has been a rising figure among what can be generously described as the Trumpist intelligentsia. Accordingly, Vought was tapped to write Project 2025’s chapter on transforming the Executive Office of the Presidency, which laid out his vision for consolidating power in political appointees and away from career officials. He was also the policy chief for the Republican National Committee’s platform committee, further enmeshing himself and his ideas in the fabric of the GOP’s ideology. Even more concerning is that Vought intends to keep his group’s efforts hidden from view until after the election. Another CCR journalist spoke with Micah Meadowcroft, the Center for Renewing America’s research director, who bragged about the clandestine methods being used to get the drafts into the Trump team’s hands: This “second phase” of Project 2025 is what takes the document from being a set of wonky recommendations to an actual blueprint for what the next four years could look like. It’s how Trump triggers the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. It’s how he transforms the Justice Department into his own personal weapon for revenge. And it’s how the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court is given the cover to say it was all done legally. It’s also why Trump is so eager to distance himself from the initiative, as the document’s drafters and overseers readily admit. If enough voters look closely enough at what he intends to do, then there’s a chance for opposition to those actions to take root. We’ve already seen Trump scramble since Democrats began hammering Project 2025 into the public consciousness. It’s ironic that so many Republicans are now trying to say that the only way for Trump to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris is through a focus on policy over personal attacks. If that were the case, then we’d see them embracing and promoting Project 2025 and Vought’s work. Instead, they realize that remaining secretive gives them their best chance at executing their extreme ideas."
