Kamala Harris has MAGA world freaking out about demons and the apocalypse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 4, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-maga-jezebel-apocalypse-rcna164922,"It’s always the end of the world for the Make America Great Again movement. Ever since Donald Trump’s escalator ride in 2015, there’s been zero nuance to the MAGA message. “Only I can fix it,” the leader roared to thunderous applause upon accepting the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. But especially since Vice President Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic nominee, MAGA messaging has gone from overwrought and hyperbolic to absolutely hysterical and apocalyptic. Trumpists wave off any and all criticism as unworthy of discussion, bad-faith accusations from minds afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. And yet, deranged is the only appropriate descriptor of the rhetoric emanating from MAGA land’s loudest megaphones. It’s Trump and some of his closest allies and most prominent boosters who have been speaking of an imminent totalitarian government, end times and literal biblical demons. These people include podcasters with massive, fiercely dedicated audiences. Titans of industry. Religious extremists with political ambitions and close ties to Trump world. And the richest man in the world. In just the past week, popular MAGA pundits warned that Harris is “Hitler and Stalin combined but times 200,” and also a “commie” who will choose a running mate who supports “allowing men to beat up women in the Olympics.” They also expressed outrage over the opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics as the end of “Western civilization,” and singled out one woman on a Zoom fundraiser call for Harris’ campaign as another harbinger of end times. Then there was the billionaire Trump supporter who finally freed himself from the burden of pretending he’s not MAGA, Elon Musk, bringing back one of his favorite apocalyptic buzzwords, “extinctionist,” to describe Harris. (And because he’s a serious adult, he called her “Shamala.”) Musk once generally reserved that term for environmentalists — or really anyone concerned about climate change. But he’s since expanded the definition to anything that involves the mysterious and horror-movie-sounding “woke mind virus.” In 2023, Musk told Joe Rogan, “It’s essentially the extinctionists. It is that they’re propagating the extinction of humanity and civilization.” It’s hard to argue what’s “most disturbing” among these deranged comments from very angry people, but a worthy contender came from Lance Wallnau, the influential Christian nationalist who has the ears of both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. He likened the first Black and Indian woman to be nominated for president by a major party to Jezebel — a spirit with demonic powers. In case he wasn’t driving the point home with just the name, Wallnau clarified that Harris represents “the spirit of Jezebel … in a way that’ll be even much more ominous than Hillary because she’ll bring a racial component and she’s younger.” The MAGA right hasn’t cornered the market on ridiculous and irresponsible hyperbole in politics. Left, right and center are all capable of taking liberties with facts, hyping the fear factor and exaggerating the stakes. But of all American political tribes, there’s only one with politically influential figures using this election season to prophesize about Jezebels and explicitly making it about race and gender. Or literally warning of the imminent end of the world because of a Marxist conspiracy to smuggle totalitarianism on an unsuspecting public through environmentalism. This was once the content you’d find on the furthest, most ridiculous fringes of the AM radio dial. And they are what remains of the brain trust of the MAGA movement. The first Trump presidency — right up to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and ultimate incitement of a riot at the Capitol — was consistent in the fact that the only people who stayed until the end were the true believers. Anyone with a modicum of independence was jettisoned, forever. The aforementioned MAGA influencers are worthy of ridicule, sure, but they’re more worthy of thoughtful, diligent scrutiny, because they’d be guiding forces of what might pass for principles in a second Trump administration."
Kamala Harris shouldn’t ignore immigration. She should run on it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 4, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-defend-immigration-become-president-rcna164423,"As Democrats have coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, Republicans have, in turn, coalesced around their main issue to attack: immigration. President Joe Biden had struggled to respond to immigration criticism. Harris can do better, and she should start by doing the one thing that Biden failed to do: defending immigrants.  Biden’s strategy was simply to ignore immigration. When pressed, he’d say, “They should all be going back.” During his debate with former President Donald Trump, he touted his recent “total ban” on asylum. It’s no surprise that with both parties’ nominees arguing in favor of restriction, more voters are shifting to the Trump position.  But elevating the Trump position hurt Biden and will hurt Harris. If voters want Trump policies, they will elect Trump. At this point, it’s worse than wasted breath to talk about how Biden’s team tried to deport as many people as it could. Defending immigrants would be the most unexpected way to turn the tide in her favor.  The only speech Trump knows how to give is: “Immigrants are coming over the border to kill you.” But the facts about crime are devastating to Trump: When he was president, homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, and as immigrants have come in under the Biden administration, the violent crime and homicide rates have fallen by historic amounts.  Do immigrants deserve any credit? Probably! Immigrants commit fewer serious crimes that put them in prison, including fewer criminal homicides, than U.S.-born Americans. At the same time, by buying vacant homes and starting businesses at higher rates, they revitalize distressed neighborhoods hollowed out by pandemic-induced population loss. This indirectly lowers the crime rate.  Harris should ask Trump directly: So why do you want less safe, shrinking communities with higher crime rates?  Trump would no doubt also say, as he did during his convention speech, that the Biden immigration surge has brought “poverty” and “destruction to communities all across our land.” Harris should be ready.  Destruction? The Congressional Budget Office finds that the surge will boost the economy by $7 trillion and reduce the federal debt by nearly $1 trillion by 2034.  With America’s aging population, the country is millions of workers short of what Social Security needs for revenues to meet expenses by 2034, and the Social Security trustees say immigration will help close the gap. The Federal Reserve chair believes that new immigrants most likely helped stave off a recession by increasing economic growth.  Again, Harris should ask Trump: Why do you want a smaller economy with more debt? Why do you want to undermine Social Security? Do you want a recession? Trump hates to talk about immigration as an economic phenomenon partly because, as a business owner who has hired undocumented workers, he knows that it is beneficial. Instead, he would deflect to something else, like fentanyl trafficking.  Once again, Harris has the facts: U.S. citizens are 89% of fentanyl traffickers, and when did fentanyl overdoses spike? In 2020, under Trump, when the border was supposedly closed. According to recent academic research, immigration is associated with fewer overdose deaths. This is most likely because immigrants are much less likely to be consumers of dangerous drugs, so they overdose much less than other people. Trump’s efforts to demonize immigrants work when his opponents don’t bother countering his attacks. Harris doesn’t have to lead with immigration. But she can’t simply let Trump spew lies about immigrants for hours and expect it not to hurt her chances.  This confrontational approach may seem too risky politically, but it’s worth remembering that Joe Biden campaigned in 2020 against Trump’s harsh policies, and he won. In the general election debate, he criticized Trump for deporting asylum-seekers to “squalor.” His reversal hasn’t helped him. It has only validated Trump’s criticisms. Democrats’ instincts are right in one respect: Americans really don’t like chaos. Harris shouldn’t defend lawlessness. Instead, she should tout how the administration is quietly rebuilding the legal immigration system devastated by four years of President Trump and creating new legal ways for people to come, reducing illegal immigration.  Much more work must be done to fix the system, but Harris can credibly say she wants people to come lawfully. How exactly does Trump think people should come? Well, Trump’s record shows that he only slashed legal immigration. He didn’t reduce illegal immigration. That’s the only answer that matters. Harris needs to see that Biden’s defensiveness about immigration failed badly. She must start from a position of strength. Immigrants — legal and illegal — are helping America solve its biggest challenges. Force Trump to explain why that’s bad. He can’t, but so far, he has never had to. Now is Harris’ chance to change that."

Alfred crossed the finish line in 10.72 seconds to win Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal. Richardson came in behind her at 10.87 seconds and Jefferson at 10.92 seconds. It is both Richardson’s and Jefferson’s first-ever Olympic medal as well. Although the U.S. had high hopes for a gold from Richardson, who was the reigning 100-meter world champion coming into the race, her second-place win Saturday was nevertheless a triumphant Olympic comeback. Three years ago, the 24-year-old was suspended from the sport for a month after testing positive for THC, which prevented her from participating in the Tokyo Olympics (THC is not a performance-enhancing drug, but it is a prohibited substance in the Games). Richardson won her opening-round heat on Friday. She came in second in the 100-meter semifinal earlier on Saturday, also behind Alfred."
"Jimmy Carter, 99, is holding out to vote for Kamala Harris, his grandson says",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 1:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jimmy-carter-vote-kamala-harris-rcna165019,"Former President Jimmy Carter, who is in hospice care and is less than two months away from his 100th birthday, is holding out to vote for Kamala Harris for president, his grandson Jason Carter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His son Chip Carter had asked if he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday, according to Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator. The nonagenarian then told his son, “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” his grandson said. Carter entered hospice care at his Georgia home in February 2023. He is the oldest living and longest-lived former president in U.S. history. He will turn 100 years old on Oct. 1, and early voting in Georgia begins on Oct. 15. Carter has had less frosty relations with Donald Trump relative to his fellow former Democratic presidents. He has criticized some of Trump’s behaviors while also defending him from the media in the past. However, in 2019, he suggested that the Republican was an illegitimate president, saying, “Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.” Meanwhile, Trump has made references to the 99-year-old in his attacks on President Joe Biden. During a campaign speech in January, Trump brought up former first lady Rosalynn Carter’s funeral (which his wife attended but he did not) saying, “It was beautiful. Jimmy Carter was there. I thought to myself, ‘Jimmy Carter is happy now, because he will go down as a brilliant president by comparison to Joe Biden.’”"
Elizabeth Taylor turned a scandal into a playbook for modern fame,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hbos-elizabeth-taylor-doc-chronicles-birth-modern-celebrity-rcna164997,"Two years after igniting a global scandal of such seismic proportions it was said to have knocked NASA’s first orbit of the Earth off the front pages, 32-year-old Elizabeth Taylor sat down with Life magazine’s Richard Meryman to tell her side of the story. The 40 hours of audio recordings from these interviews constitute the bulk of HBO Max’s new documentary “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes,” which brings the late actress’s story to life in her own words. The documentary humanizes the two-time Oscar winner, exhibiting her personality, humor and the obstacles she faced both personally and professionally as she scaled the behemoth of midcentury Hollywood misogyny. In doing so, the film paints a three-dimensional picture of the complex woman behind the eight marriages, bewitching eyes and incessant gossip headlines that later dominated the Elizabeth Taylor mystique. For many years, this half-mythical caricature of Taylor distracted from the transformative impact she had on society and culture. Only recently, for example, has she been given credit — including by the likes of Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian — for inventing the prototype of the modern celebrity. In the podcast series “Elizabeth the First,” Perry labels Taylor the “first true influencer” for pioneering the concept of a public figure as their own brand long before it was fashionable. Taylor debuts this shrewd understanding of her “public” versus “private” self throughout the tapes, creating distance from what she calls “Elizabeth Taylor, the commodity.” Refusing to apologize or justify herself, she instead muses over her so-called “immoral” reputation with stone-cold detachment. “There is a private Elizabeth,” she tells Meryman. “The other Elizabeth, the famous one, really has no depth or meaning to me. It is a commodity that makes money.” Her cynicism is understandable. As the tapes reveal, Taylor’s public image was artificially imposed on her for years by the Hollywood studio system, which manufactured her into a “sex symbol” as young as 16, while also confining her to low-paying, often low-quality pictures. “I was forced to do things that I hated,” she tells Meryman. “I was given such s---- that you should choke on.” But over time, “a kind of rebellion started within me,” Taylor recalls. After her seven-year contract ended, the then-30-year-old was free to choose her own films and set her price tag. “I was quite the businesswoman,” she laughs, recounting how she became the first actress to negotiate a $1 million salary ($10 million today) for what she called the “ridiculous” idea of casting her as Cleopatra. Taylor shows a sense of humor, and at times outright contempt, for the production, which overthrew two dynasties of Fox leadership, gutted directors’ careers, ended two marriages, nearly bankrupted Twentieth Century Fox (at a staggering $450 million in today’s dollars), launched an FBI investigation and even damaged U.S. foreign relations abroad, according to damning remarks immortalized in the U.S. Congressional Record. At the same time, the tumultuous production marked a transformative moment in Taylor’s career, when she began to use her fame and notoriety as a weapon against the patriarchal culture that had long dictated and profited off her image. After years of genuflecting before patronizing executives, producers and directors — whom she bitterly recalls dismissing her as a “movie star, not an actress” — the then-four-times-married mother of three discovered she could beat them at their own game. By leaving what she reveals to be an unhappy and at times abusive marriage to Eddie Fisher and having a very public affair — and worse still, refusing to apologize for it — Taylor took a gamble with the public that paid off. Whether by accident or design, Taylor’s “breaking of conventions,” as she described her and Richard Burton’s affair, coincided with a slow-rolling spirit of rebellion taking place across America in the 1960s. She not only rose from the ashes of moral indignation unscathed, but also saw her notoriety skyrocket to levels never seen before, and possibly since. During and after the film, Taylor’s private life garnered such ferocious public interest that an entire industry — the paparazzi — stepped in to satisfy the demand. While Taylor resents their intrusive presence in the tapes, they also, inadvertently, helped further liberate her from the overbearing grip of the studio, inviting the public in to make their own decisions about her. By tearing down the barrier between the star and the public, Taylor’s act of “rebellion” not only weakened one of the few levers of power the studio regime still wielded, but also allowed her to engineer a new playbook for modern stardom entirely from scratch. In it, she portrayed a version of herself to the public that didn’t conceal her flaws, but embraced them. It could be argued that there are two Hollywoods: one before Elizabeth Taylor and one after. Today, fans want and expect truth, vulnerability and controversy from celebrities. Scandals are no longer liabilities, but assets. From Taylor Swift to Kim Kardashian, there is no such thing as either a “perfect” star or a “private” one. In giving celebrities the power to be themselves, Taylor’s model transformed the public into consumers of their public lives, rather than just observers, in a way that forever altered what it means to be famous. While it’s arguable whether this new model has been good or bad, the documentary is a fascinating reminder of where the debate over the private lives of public figures first began. Taylor’s greatest legacy was bringing honesty and candor to stardom in a way that forever transformed the relationship between celebrities and the public — and freed Hollywood stars to be, for better or worse, themselves. By using her fame to push boundaries, Taylor chipped away at the oppressive outerwear of an antiquated, patriarchal system, exposing its vulnerabilities and at the same time bringing contentious issues to the forefront of public awareness throughout her career. By giving new context to a woman who was, in many ways, too modern for her time, the film cements Taylor’s legacy not as a sex symbol, but as the trailblazing actress, feminist, philanthropist, entrepreneur and activist who played a central role in shaping the world of fame as we know it today."
"Judge tees up dismissal of Giuliani bankruptcy, opening door for creditors to collect",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 12:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-freeman-moss-rcna165001,"A judge approved a deal to dismiss Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy on Friday, which will bring an end to a case that has for months frustrated his creditors and, at times, even the judge. The dismissal of Giuliani’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy will mean his creditors can soon begin to go after his assets to recover some of the money they’re owed. That includes Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, two Georgia election workers whom Giuliani defamed over the 2020 election and to whom he owes nearly $150 million in a civil judgment. A former lawyer for Donald Trump, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December 2023 after being handed the verdict in Freeman and Moss’ defamation case. His seeking bankruptcy protections meant that the Georgia women could not begin to collect on the judgment, and it froze proceedings in the other civil lawsuits against him (he has denied any wrongdoing in those cases). But the disgraced lawyer’s bankruptcy bogged down in what his creditors characterized as his stonewalling and lack of cooperation. Giuliani’s lawyers eventually requested that his bankruptcy be converted to Chapter 7 so that his assets could be liquidated, then later proposed the case be dismissed entirely. New York Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane agreed in mid-July to dismiss Giuliani’s bankruptcy, but afterward threatened to reverse that decision because of Giuliani’s failure to pay roughly $400,000 in administrative expenses — which Giuliani claimed he did not have the ability to pay. On Wednesday, Giuliani came to an agreement with his creditors to pay $100,000 of that sum now, and then settle the remainder of those expenses when he sells his penthouse apartment in New York or his Florida condo. The $100,000 is due one business day after the Friday ruling, after which his bankruptcy case will officially be dismissed, NBC News reported. Giuliani’s spokesperson, Ted Goodman, did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Attorneys for Freeman and Moss also did not respond."
The U.S.-Puerto Rico basketball clash is more than a game,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 3, 2024, 10:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-puerto-rico-basketball-statehood-rcna164491,"UPDATE (August 3, 2024, 1:20 p.m. ET): On Saturday, the U.S. men's basketball team held off Puerto Rico, winning 104-83. For the first time since 2004, the Puerto Rico men’s basketball team is playing in the Olympics. It hasn’t been a smooth ride: The team lost its first two games against South Sudan and Serbia. But on Saturday, the team has a chance to repeat what it did 20 years ago to the day: upset a United States team stacked with NBA superstars. That historic 92-73 win in Athens, powered by a career game from guard Carlos Arroyo, is forever etched in Puerto Rico’s national history and cultural identity. On paper, a Paris repeat may seem impossible. This year’s U.S. team has more former NBA MVPs than any team in the Games’ history. The Americans are playing like defending Olympic champions and the U.S. is otherwise undefeated against Puerto Rico in all-time Olympic competition. “It’s never impossible,” Arroyo, now the team’s general manager, told CBS News last month about a repeat upset. “It’s just never impossible.” If the impossible indeed becomes possible on Saturday, it will remind the world that even though Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, sports sovereignty and pride might be the reasons why the U.S. colony might never become a state. “The basketball is the weapon,” Flor Meléndez, the legendary assistant coach of that 2004 team, told me in Spanish for a podcast episode I reported in 2021. “We Puerto Ricans don’t have an army, but for us, that was the weapon we used to represent our country. The basketball jersey was our uniform. That is how I felt.” Not an Olympics goes by without people asking why Puerto Rico has Olympic teams and athletes in the first place. The history is a complicated one, and every time a Puerto Rican experiences Olympic success, debates about identity and who gets to call themselves Puerto Rican follow. It is the constant tug and pull that affects an estimated 3.2 million Puerto Ricans living on the island and another 5.8 million who reside in the 50 states. That complexity extends Puerto Rico’s strong men’s basketball tradition, which wouldn’t have reached a golden age were it not for Puerto Ricans born and raised in cities like New York. These conflicting impulses are particularly difficult to reconcile for the island’s most ardent supporters of statehood. Current Gov. Pedro Pierluisi and other statehood advocates hail Puerto Rico’s Olympic team even as they advocate for a political status that would essentially end the island’s proud sports sovereignty. Statehood supporters argue the island can have both. It’s true that official Olympic representation is governed by the International Olympic Committee, which has considered Puerto Rico an official member since 1948. Edwin Jusino, a Puerto Rican historian who focuses on sports and supports statehood for Puerto Rico, pointed out that governments are not the arbiters of national teams. That falls on national olympic committees (NOCs) and their sporting federations. “These NOCs are supposed to be autonomous from each country and operate without direct government interference,” Jusino said, noting that the world’s top surfer, John John Florence, surfs for Hawaii in a professional league. But Florence just competed in the 2024 Paris Games for — you guessed it — Team USA. If Puerto Rico were to become a state, there’s no reason to expect there would still be a Team Puerto Rico. In addition, in the specific case of international basketball, FIBA’s own 2021 statutes say that a national federation applying for membership must be “the controlling body of basketball in a country that is an independent state, recognized by the international community.” Puerto Rico became a FIBA member in 1957, but if it were to apply today, it wouldn’t be part of FIBA, and it would not be a member if statehood ever became a reality. (When I asked the IOC if it would still recognize Puerto Rico if it became a state, a spokesperson replied via email, “We cannot comment on speculations.”) Still, that won’t stop statehood supporters from trying to twist the logic, as if the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) would oblige. There is also the issue of American culture itself. At this moment in American politics, the rallying cry of “united we stand” has taken on xenophobic tones. It’s hard to believe that the United States, which has literally owned Puerto Rico since 1898, would be so magnanimous as to let Puerto Rico become a state and then keep sports sovereignty. The current Republican platform doesn’t even address Puerto Rico’s political status after years of supporting statehood. Democrats are still being criticized by Puerto Rico diaspora groups for not fully embracing the status question. In the end, once again Puerto Rico is being ignored and misunderstood. Another nonbinding status plebiscite is scheduled for November, and statehood advocates should at least be honest with their fellow Puerto Ricans that statehood will be the end of sports sovereignty and national pride. But Saturday in Paris, Puerto Ricans can briefly put those questions on hold. As I said at the end of my 2021 report about that upset in Athens 20 years ago: The impossible has happened before. Why not again?"
Harris campaign says Trump is ‘running scared’ after he floats Fox News debate with new rules,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 9:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-debate-kamala-harris-audience-fox-news-rcna164990,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is insisting that Donald Trump honor his commitment to the ABC News debate on Sept. 10, rather than schedule an entirely different debate with new terms and a new date. “Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” the Harris campaign said in a statement on Saturday. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept. 10.” After refusing for several weeks to commit to debating Harris, the former president wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday that he had “agreed” to a Fox News debate against her on Sept. 4 with a “FULL ARENA AUDIENCE,” reneging on previously agreed-upon debate rules that he had set with President Joe Biden’s campaign. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment sent by NBC News early Saturday. Not having a live audience at the debate had been one of the Biden campaign’s key demands, especially against an opponent who is more prone to lying and delivering sound bites than to engaging in substantive policy discussion. Trump has waffled on his participation in the Sept. 10 debate since Biden dropped out of the race. Harris has repeatedly challenged Trump to meet her on the debate stage, and Democrats have taunted the former president as being “afraid” to go up against Harris, a former prosecutor. In his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the ABC News debate had been “terminated” because Biden had stepped aside, and he cited his ongoing litigation against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos as a “conflict of interest” (while using a disparaging distortion of Stephanopoulos’ name). Trump’s defamation lawsuit against Stephanopoulos and ABC News had already been underway when his campaign agreed to the Sept. 10 debate with the network. The Harris campaign said Saturday that it would be “happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to.” The de facto Democratic nominee will still appear at the ABC News event whether or not Trump participates, her campaign said."
There's a simple reason Simone Biles seems unbeatable at the Paris Olympics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 3, 2024, 8:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/simone-biles-paris-olympics-gymnastics-vault-difficulty-score-rcna164948,"UPDATE (August 3, 2024, 11:20 a.m. ET): On Saturday, Simone Biles won gold in the women's vault, bringing her total of Paris Olympic gold medals to three, with two more events to go. The allure of gymnastics has always been in the jaw-dropping leaps and flips and twists. The sport has evolved considerably over the decades, with those flips and twists becoming even more difficult — and more impressive. We are living through a truly historic era of innovation. And no surprise: Simone Biles, the GOAT, the most decorated Olympic gymnast, and perhaps athlete, of all time, is at the helm. On Saturday, after leading Team USA to a gold medal in the women’s team final and earning a second gold in the individual all-around competition, Biles looks to add to her Paris haul on the vault. On Thursday, Biles helped secure her all-around gold with a Yurchenko double pike, which has become known as the Biles II. She is the only woman who has ever completed that skill in a world competition. It truly feels magical to watch her complete the Biles II with such power and grace. And therein lies one of the secrets to Biles’ immense success. Because besides the numerous titles and sustained dominance in the sport for over a decade, Biles is set apart by the degree to which she surpasses the competition. She does not win by tenths or even a single point but by multiple points. At the U.S. Olympic trials, she won by over 5 points, the rough equivalent of nearly six falls. Theoretically, this means Biles could have fallen half a dozen times and still beat the 2020 Olympic champion, Sunisa Lee. Biles is truly in a league of her own. But how is this possible? The answer is simple. Biles performs some of the hardest skills in the world and continues to complete increasingly harder ones, including some that no one else can do. Biles’ difficulty puts on her on a completely differently level; a new starting point means a new end point. And, under the current scoring system, she’s rewarded for it. A major 2006 change to the gymnastics scoring system has allowed for and encouraged athletes to push for difficulty. Under the current code of points, the execution score (E-score) of 10.0 remains in place, but the difficulty score (D-score) has no cap. What this means is gymnasts no longer have equal scoring potential. It’s like making the 3-point shot into a 4-point shot if it’s made from the top of the key; Caitlin Clark would have a higher scoring potential than her competitors because she can execute a more difficult shot. But here again, Biles highlights what makes her so incredibly special. The 27-year-old is not simply doing the hardest tricks, she does them with exquisite execution, which allows her to be incredibly consistent. Her technique, power and precision are together essential to her ability to do what no one else can do, but it also means that her timing is nearly perfect, and her execution scores are consistently strong. When you add that together — the unmatched levels of difficulty, striking execution and rock-solid consistency — you have a gymnast who is for all intents and purposes unbeatable. And that’s what we have in Simone Biles. Don’t get me wrong — there are event specialists who can top Biles on a single apparatus. For example, Kaylia Nemour, who is competing for Algeria, boasts a 7-point start value on the uneven bars (compared to Biles’ 6.4) and Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade is perhaps the closest rival to Biles on the vault and floor events. In fact, during the all-around final this week, Biles made a crucial error on the uneven bars that opened the door (however lightly) for Andrade. In the end, Biles’ stellar beam and floor routines landed her on top, with Andrade taking silver. But it was a reminder that even GOATs are human. Now, we will get to see more of that head-to-head competition in the individual event finals over the next few days, starting with vault on Saturday and ending with the balance beam and floor exercise on Monday.

The real reason Team Trump keeps trying to call Kamala Harris a ‘DEI hire’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/team-trump-calls-kamala-harris-dei-hire-rcna164117,"Despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ education, her years as a prosecutor, her having served as California attorney general and a U.S. senator, Republicans such as Reps. Harriet Hageman, of Wyoming, and Tim Burchett, of Tennessee, are among many who have referred to her as a “DEI hire.” Hageman said: “I think she’s one of the weakest candidates I’ve ever seen in the history of our country. I mean intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel. ... I think that she was a DEI hire.” Burchett referred to her as “our DEI vice president.” They could have attacked Harris’ record without referring to DEI, but instead they chose to say “DEI hire” and “DEI vice president” to perpetuate a narrative that people of color and women can only be in positions of power or authority because of quotas, preferential treatment and unfair advantage given to them based on their social identities. That is: not because of their education, qualifications, training or experience. These false racist and sexist attacks seek to reinforce beliefs that the best, and potentially only, people qualified to lead America are white men. Attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion are attempts to maintain the status quo.    Attacking the credibility of people of color, women, people with disabilities and others from historically marginalized groups is nothing new in America. The only thing new is the collective misrepresentation of the term diversity, equity, and inclusion to do it. The acronym DEI has been weaponized by people who feel threatened by the racial diversification of America and its leadership; the success of women in corporate and public sector jobs; the mere presence of people with disabilities in the workplace and in society; as well as the increased visibility of LGBTQ+ people and their families. They perceive that reality as an existential crisis. In addition to elected officials, there have been numerous recent examples of highly visible powerbrokers and pundits denigrating people of color, specifically Black people, claiming they are unqualified for the positions they hold, and that they were hired based on their race, not merit. In January, not long after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in flight, Elon Musk took to his social media platform X to criticize efforts by United Airlines and Boeing to diversify their pilots and factory workers. “It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE,” he wrote, misspelling the acronym.  He was responding to an X user who speculated about the IQs of pilots who attended historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. The next day, Musk said, “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening.” His lie that the airline’s DEI policies had endangered the public was shared with millions of X users. Again, this is not new. First, powerful opponents of progress sought to discredit and gut affirmative action policies. Now they have their sights set on anything they choose to label DEI. This strategy to characterize Black people as unqualified, framed within the context of “DEI hires,” is a targeted effort to attack policies and practices that have created pathways to leadership and power for people of color, women, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, and others. Because while “DEI hire” has been most frequently used to discredit women and people of color, it is also used to devalue the contributions of people with disabilities and other marginalized and oppressed identities. The weaponization of the term DEI cuts across sectors and disciplines, including in health care and medicine, where I have had health care executives tell me that DEI efforts in hospitals or medical schools lower standards and thereby jeopardize the quality of care provided to patients. One health care executive went so far as to say that “a diverse hire,” another way to say DEI hire, would underperform because they trained at an HBCU. Although factually inaccurate, these beliefs about DEI have taken hold in our national narrative.  So, what is DEI really? Diversity, equity and inclusion supports full participation of all people; promotes fair treatment through the intentional use of power, policies and practices; and values individuals within the context of their identities, not in spite of them. It is a response to glaring inequities throughout society, particularly those in education and employment. Recent reversals of public and institutional policies that advance DEI are most often the result of orchestrated resistance by people who believe that DEI will disenfranchise and disempower white people, especially white men. Frankly, the data does not support those claims. After decades of policies and practices to support DEI, inequities in opportunities and pay continue to plague women and people of color. A 2021 study by Judd Kessler and Corinne Low found that “firms hiring in STEM fields rated minority and female candidates significantly lower than white males. Among STEM majors, to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75 GPA, a minority or female candidate needed a 4.0.” Even with DEI policies in place, Black women make 66 cents on the dollar compared with their white male counterparts, when doing the same jobs with comparable qualifications. These statistics and examples indicate the necessity of DEI. They also point to how dangerous the misappropriation and weaponization of DEI is to decades of slow and fragile social progress and policy change.  The truth about DEI is that it promotes American values that are necessary for a healthy, functional and thriving democracy. It is consistent with ideals such as liberty and justice for all people. That is not a zero-sum game where one group’s gain is another’s loss. Instead, it is America making good on its promise to create a society where everyone can flourish and contribute their talents and skills to the collective good while having a fair chance to succeed. These ideals are woven into the complex fabric of who we are as a nation, and we cannot afford to regress to darker times.

Why Project 2025 is still a threat,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/project-2025-still-threat-rcna164949,"After the director of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 stepped down on Tuesday, the Trump campaign once again attempted to distance itself, writing it “welcomed” reports of the project’s “demise.” This statement is nothing new. On our show, we’ve extensively covered the absurdity of former President Donald Trump’s selective amnesia around Project 2025. In short, Trump has claimed numerous times to “know nothing” about Project 2025, even though the plan was developed by his former and (likely) future staff. Furthermore, in newly surfaced audio, Heritage President Kevin Roberts is heard acknowledging that Trump’s claims of ignorance about Project 2025 are a “political tactical decision.” If you need any more proof that Trump’s denial is misleading, on Thursday it was reported that Sen. JD Vance wrote the foreword to Roberts’ new book, in which Vance called Roberts’ ideas “an essential weapon.” Roberts has confirmed that Project 2025 “completed exactly what it set out to do” and will continue its efforts to “build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels — federal, state, and local.” As New York Times reporter Jonathan Swan noted, Project 2025 already finished its comprehensive list of policy recommendations. The work is already done. On Thursday, President Joe Biden announced the successful negotiation of a prisoner exchange leading to the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran Paul Whelan, and journalists Vladimir Kara-Murza and Alsu Kurmasheva, marking a major diplomatic achievement. This swap is one of the largest and most complex prisoner exchanges in U.S. history, involving seven countries and the release of 24 individuals from around the world. And it is a major victory for Biden’s administration. There are not many joyful days in diplomacy, but the impact of the successful exchange, likely months in the making, was evident as national security adviser Jake Sullivan became visibly emotional while discussing the return of these hostages. It’s also important to remember that this is just the beginning for those who have been released. As Jason and Yeganeh Rezaian discussed on our show in July marking the 10th anniversary of their wrongful imprisonment in Iran, a safe release marks the start of a long journey of recovery. In the spirit of the Olympic Games, our spotlight this week is on Monica Tranel, a former Olympian and current candidate for Montana’s 1st Congressional District. Tranel represented the United States in rowing at the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics. After her athletic career, she became an attorney and staunch advocate for clean energy and environmental protections. She has worked to defend the interests of small businesses and local ranchers and continues to prioritize the preservation of Montana’s public lands in her political campaigns. Tranel came within just 3 points of winning in 2022. In June, the Cook Political Report considered the seat “likely Republican,” but it remains an interesting race to watch. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shot onto many peoples’ radars in the last few weeks following his outspoken criticism of the Republican Party’s “weird” agenda. Whether it’s Trump’s incoherent ramblings about Hannibal Lecter or the GOP’s desire to ban books and dictate what can happen in your exam room, Walz isn’t holding back. Walz is also on the short list of contenders for Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential pick, and his bold perspectives are a key reason why. In a recent appearance on our show, Walz blasted Republicans and Project 2025 for their efforts to eliminate VA benefits, and he also broke down why the “weird” label sticks to Trump and Vance. What show are you bingeing right now?  Nothing right now, but I just finished “3 Body Problem” and “Shogun.” What’s the last book you read? “Command and Control” by Eric Schlosser. What time do you wake up on the weekends? At around 6 a.m. I wake up, go for a run, and usually head out to the dog park with our dog, Scout.   How do you take your coffee?

Biden's historic prisoner exchange was a feat Trump could never have achieved,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 3:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-biden-prisoner-exchange-russia-rcna164944,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" On Thursday, basketball star Brittney Griner helped lead the U.S. women’s basketball team to victory against Belgium at the 2024 Paris Olympics.  The reason that victory was possible — the reason Griner was able to represent the U.S. in these Olympic games — was because of a feat of diplomacy by President Joe Biden. In February 2022, Griner was detained in Russia on trumped-up charges related to cannabis products found in her luggage. By August, she had been sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. But just a few months later, in December of that year, Biden announced that he had negotiated a historic prisoner swap — securing Griner’s safe release.  That’s why Brittney Griner was able to play for Team U.S.A. in the Paris Olympics. But Griner was not the only American prisoner being held in Russia, and the Biden White House sought to use the momentum from her release to continue negotiations for other hostages.  There was Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested on espionage charges in Russia back in 2018, charges that the U.S. and Whelan have both denied. And Vladimir Kara-Murza, an American green-card holder and longtime free press advocate in Russia. His arrest appeared to be an attempt by Vladimir Putin to silence one of his biggest critics.  Putin would go on to take even more prisoners. People like Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist working for The Wall Street Journal — who was also arrested on trumped-up espionage charges. And Alsu Kurmasheva, another American journalist who was arrested in August 2023 for failing to register as a foreign agent. All of them were being held as prisoners of the Russian government …until Thursday. On Thursday, in another historic series of negotiations, Biden secured the release of all four of those prisoners as part of a remarkably high-stakes, multilateral negotiation. In total, 24 people were released: 16 held captive by Russia and eight by the U.S. and our European allies. It was the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the Cold War. That on its own is extraordinary — but the details of how this deal came together are really something.  For years, families, friends, and employers of these American prisoners have been advocating for their release. In particular, the staff of The Wall Street Journal have been pushing relentlessly and publicly for the return of their colleague. The plight of Gershkovich even became an issue in the presidential election as former President Donald Trump boasted that Gershkovich would only be free once he was elected president: “Vladimir Putin, president of Russia will do that for me,"" said Trump, ""and I don’t believe he’ll do it for anyone else.” Trump thought he alone could secure Gershkovich’s release. But many people felt otherwise — including Gershkovich’s own mother. According to The Wall Street Journal, “In April of last year, she had rushed up to President Biden at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and grabbed his hands before imploring him: ‘You are the only one who can bring my boy home.’” She was right. Not only did Biden secure the release of Gershkovich and the other hostages, he did so using a careful and skillful strategy that Trump — and probably a lot of other politicians — simply could never pull off. For starters, Putin’s price for the release of these hostages, the key bargaining chip, was Vadim Krasikov. In 2019, Krasikov was arrested for assassinating a Chechen dissident in Berlin on behalf of Russia’s intelligence agency. Krasikov was a Kremlin-linked assassin serving a life sentence in Germany. He is someone so close to Putin that Western intelligence officials reportedly speculate may have even been the Russian president’s own personal bodyguard. To secure the release of these prisoners, Biden needed to get Germany to agree to release a very high-profile criminal back into Russian custody. That’s not something the German government was eager to do. But Biden made strengthening American bonds with NATO allies, like Germany, a cornerstone of his foreign policy — a stark reversal from the Trump-era policy of alienating Western democracies in favor of autocrats and dictators. And so, when the time came for Germany to play its part and release that Russian assassin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly told President Biden, “For you, I will do this.” President Biden first started working to secure support from our allies in the summer of 2023. By early 2024, it looked like a deal was coming together. But then, the whole thing nearly fell apart. One of the prisoners who the U.S. and Europe were hoping to get released as part of the deal was Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. But just a week after Biden secured Germany’s support, Navalny mysteriously died in a Russian prison, prompting global outrage. Biden then dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to help ensure the arrangement with Germany and other allies would hold. According to NBC News, at a February meeting between Harris and Scholz, the pair discussed the prisoner swap the U.S. was working toward. According to the official, Harris raised something Biden had recently discussed with the chancellor — that Germany’s release of Vadim Krasikov was a critical component of getting a prisoner swap with Russia.  A White House official said, “She moved the ball forward significantly in that meeting.” The official also said Harris’ meeting in Munich with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob was arranged specifically to try to help bring Slovenia on board with the multicountry prisoner swap. These meetings continued for months. Then, on July 17, the Biden administration got the news that the deal had finally come together.  That date is significant: It was the day Biden was diagnosed with Covid. Four days later, on Sunday, July 21, at 12:45 p.m., Biden was on the phone with the Prime Minister of Slovenia, hammering out the final details of the deal.  That date is also significant: just one hour later, Biden released a statement announcing his exit from the presidential race. Imagine, for a second, the kind of focus and fortitude it takes to be working on these kinds of high-stakes negotiations — at the same time that you’re making the most difficult decision of your political career ... and also recovering from Covid. Imagine, for a moment, what would have happened if it was Donald Trump in that situation. A man who has made a political career out of maligning America’s geopolitical alliances and who has been criminally charged for his efforts to stay in power.  Thursday’s act of delicate diplomacy was possible only because Joe Biden is the president.

"JD Vance, father of three biracial kids, defends Trump’s attack on Kamala Harris’ biracial identity",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 3:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-trump-harris-biracial-attack-totally-reasonable-rcna164893,"JD Vance, who has spoken of how his three biracial children have been targeted by racist attacks, is defending Donald Trump’s attack on Kamala Harris’ biracial identity as “totally reasonable.” The GOP vice presidential nominee told CNN on Thursday that Trump was merely portraying Harris as a “chameleon” when he falsely said Wednesday that the de facto Democratic presidential nominee “happened to turn Black” after initially identifying as Indian American. When asked whether Trump’s comments — which were roundly condemned as racist and even alarmed some Republicans — gave him pause, the Ohio senator said they did not. Vance added: This wasn’t the first time that Vance — who himself has had the authenticity of his Appalachian ties called into question — has used the line of attack on the vice president. At a campaign rally earlier this week, he said that Harris had used “a fake Southern accent” during an event in Atlanta and suggested that she was more Canadian than American. (Harris lived in Canada for about six years as a teenager.) The ease with which Vance endorsed Trump’s attack on Harris should put past comments of his own under scrutiny. While running for the Senate in 2022, Vance pushed back on his Democratic opponent’s charge that he was promoting the “great replacement” theory — even though he manifestly did — and pointed to his children, who are white and Indian, as proof that he had not engaged in racism. “What happens is that my own children, my biracial children, get attacked by scumbags online and in person because you are so desperate for political power that you’ll accuse me, the father of three beautiful biracial babies, of engaging in racism,” Vance said at the time. That Vance has decried racist attacks on his children and yet is now endorsing an attack on his political opponent’s biracial identity is worth noting. In his comments to CNN, Vance appeared to equate Harris’ leaning into her different racial identities at different times as part of a broader pattern of her flip-flopping on issues. But there’s a difference between changing one’s stance on a topic — as Vance himself has done — and the immutable fact of Harris’ biracial identity. Vance, as the father of biracial children himself, should know that."
July's weak jobs report sets up political dilemma for Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 2:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/july-jobs-report-economy-fed-trump-rcna164934,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 2 episode of ""Morning Joe."" It’s the first Friday of the month, which means the Bureau of Labor Statistics has released its jobs report. And there’s good news and bad news. First, the bad news. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July and employers added just 114,000 jobs. The number of jobs added is definitely lower than we expected. We’re also seeing wage growth slow (though it is still more than inflation). Both could be a problem for the economy. July’s weaker-than-expected report will only add to concerns that the Federal Reserve has waited too long to start cutting interest rates. However, let’s think about what the Fed needs to do here, because they have to balance two jobs: One, keep inflation under control. For nearly three years, all we’ve been talking about is inflation, inflation, inflation. It’s why the Fed hasn’t cut rates yet — with rates being higher, the goal is to try to slow the economy and cool inflation. Their other job is to focus on employment. To bring down inflation, they want to make sure the economy isn’t growing too fast, but they also need to make sure it’s not slowing down so much that employers stop expanding and hiring.  This is where Friday’s report could be good news. With numbers like what we saw, it’s now more likely the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates come September. It’s possible it might be even bigger than we’ve been expecting, though a lot can happen between now and then. It’s also tricky for the Fed. September is only two months before the election and a rate cut could thrust the Fed into the political spotlight.  Donald Trump and Project 2025 have been clear about where the Republican Party stands on this. They’re interested in having more say in what the Fed does. In the end, all of this is a dilemma for both the Fed and for Democrats. By September, we might see unemployment rising too fast and more people out of work. The Fed will likely feel they have no choice but to cut. But at that point, it’s possible voters will be worrying about their jobs more than (still) high prices — or both. So when and if we see the Fed cut interest rates, prepare yourself for a lot of political noise in the final weeks before November’s election.

Biden has a good idea for fixing the Supreme Court. This is an even better one.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 2:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-supreme-court-term-limit-proposal-better-rcna164608,"President Joe Biden’s announcement Monday that a Supreme Court justice’s lifetime tenure needs to end is absolutely justified, but his suggestion to institute 18-year term limits for the justices is not the best solution. Rather, requiring Supreme Court justices to return to the Senate every decade for votes — to determine whether they are retained for another 10 years or are dismissed — would promote much-needed accountability while allowing able justices to continue to serve. This concept is a hybrid variation of a well-established procedure in many states. As of last year, 23 states required judges on their highest courts to be candidates in elections in which voters decide whether they should continue in office or not.    Letting voters decide makes sense in state judiciaries. In 24 states, judges in the states’ highest courts take office only after winning in partisan or nonpartisan elections. In other states, the judges are appointed. Candidates to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, in contrast, are confirmed by majority vote in the U.S. Senate after having been nominated by the president.  Conferring on the Senate, which confirmed justices originally, the duty to decide whether justices merit retention comports with the Constitution’s original allocation of authority. Requiring a sitting justice, after a decade on the bench, to return to the Senate for a retention vote would vastly promote accountability.  And accountability is badly needed now to rein in the current court’s aggressive agenda to overturn existing rights and cast long-standing precedents aside to satisfy the political agenda of its conservative majority. Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck described how, in the last term, the Supreme Court massively increased the power of the presidency and the ability of judges to overturn decisions made by federal regulators. If, in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a nominee conceals (or even misleads) senators about judicial philosophy to gain confirmation, there are no consequences once the justice takes office. In his confirmation hearing, Brett Kavanaugh testified that Roe v. Wade, recognizing the constitutional right to abortion, was settled law. “It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis,” Kavanaugh said. The legal principle “stare decisis” refers to a court’s applying prior decisions when ruling on a similar issue — a foundational rule, which the current Supreme Court has flouted in key decisions. Another nominee of former President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch, testified similarly in his confirmation hearing. “I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed,” he said. “A good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.” Kavanaugh and Gorsuch in 2022, joined by three other conservative justices, overruled Roe v. Wade. At least two senators who voted to confirm both men, Republican Susan Collins, of Maine, and Democrat-turned-independent Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, indicated they had been misled. The retention process promotes accountability for such behavior. Justices would be required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain how their subsequent rulings conformed to sworn testimony given during their confirmation processes. If a majority of the Senate is dissatisfied with their explanations about the differences between their testimony and their subsequent actions, the Senate could refuse to retain them. Another option for the Senate would be to decide not to retain a justice for any other reason, including ethical breaches, incompetence, failing mental acuity, political agendas or other relevant behavior.  Biden’s term limits proposal fails to promote accountability. If every justice is removed after 18 years, the sitting justices have the same degree of freedom from accountability that they possess today. They never are called to account for false statements in the confirmation process or ethical breaches or gross application of the Constitution, as in the court’s recent immunity decision allowing a president to act as a criminal without consequences. The threat of opprobrium resulting if a justice were discharged by a Senate vote of non-retention alone could be a major deterrent against misconduct by a sitting Supreme Court justice. Moreover, term limits throw out good justices and bad justices alike. The retention process allows judgments to be made by the Senate, which can retain in office those who are worthy of another decade on the bench. Some may object that a retention vote would inject too much political consideration — for example, by failing to retain a justice initially nominated by the political party then in the minority.  But the initial confirmation is highly political already. In its role in confirming nominees, the majority party in the Senate regularly has the deciding say. In recognition of this reality, the makeup of the current court is a campaign issue now. Eighteen years is a long time. Having an opportunity to assess the service of justices at 10-year intervals would allow for earlier retirements for those justices not worthy of staying in office. Both Biden’s proposal and this one would require a constitutional amendment. Given that arduous path, a remedy that ensures judicial accountability should be preferred.

Trump's federal election interference case is back with Judge Chutkan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 1:26 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-federal-election-case-chutkan-immunity-rcna164930,"The federal election interference prosecution against Donald Trump is finally back in the trial court. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan can now apply the Supreme Court’s ruling bestowing broad criminal immunity on former presidents to Trump’s case, to see what’s left of it after the high court imposed a new and murky immunity test. It’s unclear what precise form that complex project will take — whether with written briefs, hearings or a combination of the two. What’s clear is that a trial won’t happen before November’s presidential election and that if Trump wins that election then his federal cases are good as gone (special counsel Jack Smith is appealing Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the other federal case, regarding classified documents and obstruction). In the July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States, Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion said the court is sending the case back to Chutkan to decide “in the first instance” how the immunity test applies to Trump’s case. Recall that the ruling said former presidents are entitled to at least presumptive immunity for all “official acts.” It’s now on the lower court to figure out whether some of his alleged conduct in trying to subvert the 2020 election was official or unofficial, and whether prosecutors can rebut the presumption of immunity for certain official acts. As an example of what Chutkan must decide, Roberts noted that she needs to examine, “with appropriate input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Whatever Chutkan decides may be appealed again to the justices before any trial can happen, further making any pre-election trial impracticable. The bigger question now is, if Trump loses in November, what will remain of the indictment after it’s fully litigated through the courts, which could take months at least. The case, which was previously set for a March trial, had been on hold while Trump pressed his immunity appeal. Adding another variable, the immunity opinion also noted the Supreme Court’s ruling this past term in Fischer v. United States that narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants. As Trump is charged with obstruction-related counts, among others, Roberts’ ruling said in a footnote, referencing the obstruction statute: “If necessary, the District Court should determine in the first instance whether the Section 1512(c)(2) charges may proceed in light of our decision in Fischer.” We’ll likely know the next steps in the case through Chutkan’s docket, where she may issue an order telling the parties how she’ll proceed.

Judge suspends Justin Timberlake's driver's license after singer declined sobriety test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 1:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/justin-timberlake-driver-license-suspended-arrest-dwi-rcna164909,"A judge has suspended pop singer Justin Timberlake's New York driver's license because he declined to take a breathalyzer test after he was pulled over and arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated in June. Sag Harbor Justice Carl Irace on Friday ordered the suspension of the singer's license in a virtual court hearing, in accordance with New York state law. Timberlake’s lawyer, Ed Burke, told NBC News that the suspension is in place for the duration of the court case. Timberlake called into the hearing from Antwerp, Belgium, where he is scheduled to perform this weekend as part of his ""Forget Tomorrow World Tour."" The 43-year-old pop star has pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor. Irace also reprimanded Burke for comments he made last week and threatened him with a gag order. Burke had told reporters outside of court that Sag Harbor Police had made “very significant errors” in the case and that he expected charges to be dismissed. “It comes off as an attempt to poison the case before it even begins,” Irace told the lawyer. Timberlake was arrested in the village of Sag Harbor, New York, on June 18. According to the criminal complaint, Timberlake told a police officer that he'd only had one martini and was following some friends home. Timberlake also declined to take a chemical test to determine his level of sobriety, which NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos explained ""can be introduced at trial to establish conscious evidence of guilt."" The officer noted in the complaint a slew of other behaviors from Timberlake that suggested an inebriated state, including being ""unable to divide attention,"" slowed speech, unsteady footing, ""bloodshot and glassy"" eyes and breath that smelled of alcohol."
I was elected my town’s first Black mayor. Then they changed the locks on the town hall.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 12:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/alabama-towns-first-black-mayor-speaks-rcna164416,"For almost 60 years, the positions of mayor and Town Council member in my small town of Newbern, Alabama, were “handed down” by white residents to other residents. Newbern is a small and majority-Black town, yet Black residents could not remember a single election for those positions. Almost four years ago, I ran for office. I was excited to become the town’s mayor-elect and appoint a representative Town Council to govern our community. But as the first Black person elected mayor of Newbern, I immediately ran into obstacles. The locks were changed on the town hall, and officials refused to give me access to the town’s finances. Soon after I was elected, the outgoing Town Council claimed that it held a special election to fill vacant seats and that only white people had won. But I did not know about this election and had not had an opportunity to participate in it. Nor had any of the other people who filed a lawsuit with me. Last week, my dreams and the dreams of many other residents of Newbern became a reality. After a hard-fought court battle challenging the town’s practice of not holding elections for decades, a federal judge signed off on a settlement between Black Newbern residents, including me, and the town. Newbern will finally have a democratic process. After a dispute about the town’s leadership that lasted four years, I will serve as the first Black mayor of Newbern. As a lifelong resident of Newbern and a descendant of those who had no access to the ballot, I firmly believe in exercising and protecting my fundamental right to vote. Voting is an opportunity and responsibility in helping to shape the direction, priorities and vision of our communities. Voting should not be a privilege for some; it should be a right afforded to all. This outcome is a victory for the town of Newbern, and it speaks to the dedication of Newbern residents to make their voices heard. But our battle was bigger than our town. It speaks to the importance of upholding democracy across the nation. It also reveals that in many places across the country, we have not progressed far enough and Black folks are still being denied true equality. We must stay civically engaged, work to dismantle the obvious and not-so-obvious forms of voter suppression, and recognize the power that comes with just one of us demanding a change to the status quo. Newbern is my home. And I, along with other fellow residents, refused to give in to the discrimination that prevented us, for decades, from being civically engaged in our community. That discrimination meant we were rarely a part of decisions that affected our everyday lives — from how our streets were cleaned to whether we had access to public spaces such as the town hall. There exists a long and painful history of voter suppression across the nation. Pervasive voter suppression tactics, such as literacy tests, poll taxes and intimidation, were used to keep Black Americans and other marginalized communities from engaging in the civic process. For generations, Black people have had to fight for their fundamental right to vote and participate in democracy. We have met these challenges with clarity of what is just and ready to surmount the darkest of circumstances. We have shown up to the polls, demanding to have a say in the country we have had a significant role in building and shaping. Landmark legislation like the federal Voting Rights Act has been essential in ensuring that all people, regardless of race or background, are heard. Today, contemporary challenges to voting access continue to make this an ongoing fight. As we witness the unprecedented attacks on voting rights across Alabama, the South and the nation, we must take a stand and continue to make our voices heard. A new day has dawned for Newbern. I am as excited now as I was almost four years ago when I ran. I intend to work with the residents of Newbern to make sure that every single person in our town is invested in, listened to and supported. As a part of the agreement between the parties, I submitted names to the governor of both Black and white residents to fill the open Town Council positions. As a mayor and a citizen, I vow to work with the new Town Council to ensure that justice and equality for all are upheld and achieved. We must fight for voting rights until everyone everywhere is able to exercise their fundamental right and have a say in their own communities. By supporting state and federal voting rights legislation, exercising our right to vote and staying engaged with our local representatives, we can make a difference. Every single one of us is entitled to be a part of creating the future and legacy of the country, state and town we call home."
The well-intentioned Kids Online Safety Act is ripe for MAGA exploitation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 12:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kids-online-safety-act-ron-wyden-rcna164576,"Protecting kids online shouldn’t mean making some kids safer while putting others in harm’s way. That’s why earlier this week I voted against the Kids Online Safety Act, a well-intentioned bill that unfortunately pairs important privacy and design protections with new censorship powers. I fear that these authorities could be abused by a MAGA administration to target our most vulnerable children and the technologies, like encryption, that keep them safe.  Unfortunately, KOSA and another bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, together passed the Senate on an overwhelming vote. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle congratulated themselves on standing up to Big Tech, even though many of the biggest technology and social media companies, including Microsoft, Snap and X, endorsed the bill. Together, the package contained three elements: one, a laudable children’s privacy bill by my friend Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., which I had co-sponsored; two, a similarly important proposal creating new regulations against the use of unsafe and addictive designs by social media companies; and three, the creation of a “duty of care” for companies that could allow the Federal Trade Commission to sue businesses that recommend content that could harm children’s mental health.  The first two elements help all children minimize the potential for collateral harm and are largely uncontroversial. But the “duty of care” has earned opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union, Fight For the Future, Advocates for Youth and dozens of other advocates for free speech and LGBTQ+ rights.  These groups fear that the duty of care could be used to pressure social media companies to censor information the administration in power doesn’t like, including LGBTQ+ content, reproductive health information, or other topics that regulators could decide harm kids’ mental health. That is of special concern in light of former President Donald Trump’s efforts to make it easier to purge federal employees and replace them with political operatives. While the bill’s authors have attempted to limit abuse by linking causes of action to mental health disorders, I fear that will not be sufficient to constrain culture warriors on the far right. For example, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has suggested that not having children is linked to mental illness and has repeatedly claimed that “childless cat ladies” and single adults may be less mentally fit and worthy citizens than other Americans.  “You know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable,” Vance said in 2020. “And of course, you talk about going on Twitter — final point I’ll make is you go on Twitter and almost always the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don’t have kids at home.” Someone like that has no business deciding what information Americans can or cannot see on the internet. The Heritage Foundation, architects of the dangerous and bizarre Project 2025 plan for a future Republican president, last year argued that KOSA should be used to keep trans content away from kids in the name of protecting their mental health. It is no stretch to see these crusaders for medieval values using this legislation to censor reproductive health information and discussions by and about LGBTQ+ people.  It is unfortunate that once again, Congress is faced with a well-intentioned, yet flawed, tech legislation. The last major tech bill Congress passed was SESTA-FOSTA, enacted in 2018 with the stated goal of stopping sex trafficking online by creating new liability for tech companies. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and I were the only members to vote against that bill.  I warned at the time that bill would do little to catch predators or help victims, and would only drive sex work to darker corners of the web, or the streets. Unfortunately, I’ve been proved right. After SESTA-FOSTA, violence against sex workers increased dramatically. The Government Accountability Office found that SESTA-FOSTA did virtually nothing to stop sex trafficking. Instead, it caused all kinds of information that had nothing to do with sex trafficking to be censored from the internet. Instead of passing flawed legislation like SESTA and KOSA, Congress should take on Big Tech for real, and pass legislation that will deliver for children’s safety. I’ve proposed legislation to ban all surveillance advertising and outlaw the toxic business model fueling the worst behavior online. I’ve also proposed bipartisan legislation to spend $5 billion to help protect kids from becoming victims of trafficking, and to find and prosecute the criminals who prey on children.  This is undoubtedly a deeply personal issue to many Americans. I am deeply thankful to everyone who has weighed in on KOSA, from advocates to parents to young people, both for and against the bill. And I am thankful that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-WA, worked with me and advocates to improve the bill, including reducing the powers MAGA attorneys general would have under this legislation. The result was a meaningfully better bill. But it was not enough.  Now KOSA goes to the House for its consideration. It is not too late to prevent MAGA politicians from exploiting KOSA to help wage a dangerous and retrograde culture war. It’s not too late to bolster platforms’ protections for responsible use of technologies like encryption and anonymous accounts. It is not too late for Congress to work together to pass better legislation that makes all kids safer online. "
Latest fentanyl seizure doesn’t do GOP talking points any favors,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 11:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/latest-fentanyl-seizure-doesnt-gop-talking-points-favors-rcna164910,"In his latest Fox Business interview, Donald Trump was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris’ potential running mates. “I don’t care,” the Republican responded. “Let them do whatever; they still want to have open borders.” The “open borders” line was obviously gratuitous and unnecessary. It was also, of course, factually wrong. While we're at it, let's not forget that it's also rather ironic given Trump's direct role in killing a bipartisan compromise deal that would've imposed the conservative border policies the GOP claims to want. (As one Senate Republican conceded in January, the bipartisan deal, which was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, ""would have had almost unanimous Republican support if it weren’t for Donald Trump.”) But it was also poorly timed, as evidenced by the latest Arizona Republic report. A CPB press release, issued yesterday, this seizure resulted from an American citizen who crossed the border, obtained the fentanyl, and allegedly tried to smuggle them into the United States by packing them to the frame of a sport recreational vehicle. “While conducting a thorough inspection of the pick-up truck, trailer, and sport utility vehicle, CBP officers noticed anomalies throughout the frame of the trailer,” the statement added. “With the assistance of a CBP canine team, officers discovered 234 packages of drugs concealed within the frame of a trailer. The packages contained approximately 4 million blue fentanyl pills, which is the largest fentanyl seizure in CBP history.” This roughly coincided with CBP officials also seizing 270 pounds of meth that suspected smugglers were trying to bring onto American soil. It also coincided with fresh good news about the efficacy of the Biden administration's border policies. As The New Republic’s Greg Sargent reported: I realize that for the former president and his party, the repetition of the “open borders” phrase is habitual to the point of being mindless. For all intents and purposes, Republicans no longer know or care if the claim is true — or was ever true. It’s simply what the party has decided voters are supposed to believe. But as the latest evidence makes clear, the GOP’s talking points are overdue for a rewrite."
Why a panel said Jeff Clark should be barred from law practice for two years,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 9:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jeff-clark-barred-law-license-dc-rcna164835,"A disciplinary counsel in Washington, D.C., argued that Donald Trump ally Jeffrey Clark should lose his law license. Clark argued that he shouldn’t be disciplined at all. Rejecting both contentions, the committee panel that heard evidence on the matter recommended Thursday that Clark should be suspended from practicing law for two years. With such strikingly different positions on each side, how did the panel reach that conclusion? While rejecting Clark’s claim that he essentially did nothing wrong, the panel said that, based on the evidence presented in the proceeding, his conduct wasn’t as egregious as that of Rudy Giuliani or John Eastman, whose respective disbarments were recommended in other proceedings for their 2020 election-related actions. Specifically, the panel explained in a lengthy report that the disciplinary counsel proved “by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Clark attempted dishonesty and did so with truly extraordinary recklessness.” It recounted that Clark, an environmental and civil litigator during the Trump administration, had no criminal or election experience and yet: Distinguishing Clark’s matter from Giuliani’s, the panel wrote that Giuliani “abused his license to practice law and breached his core ethical duties” in the context of representing a client in court, while Clark’s misconduct “did not involve the courts” but rather “occurred in the context of high-level discussion and debate within the Executive Branch regarding the integrity of the 2020 election, and did not involve an attempt to mislead others within the Justice Department.” Similarly, regarding Eastman, the panel noted that the California bar “found that, in connection with efforts to challenge the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, Dr. Eastman failed to support the Constitution and laws of the United States, and engaged in pervasive dishonesty, including knowingly false and misleading statements in court filings.” The recommendation doesn’t mean that Clark necessarily will be suspended for two years. Politico reported that it “will now come before the D.C. Bar’s Board of Professional Responsibility, which will make its own recommendation to the D.C. Court of Appeals. The full process could take another year to reach its conclusion.” Clark also faces related criminal charges in Georgia, alongside Trump and others in a state indictment alleging 2020 election interference. Both Clark and Trump have pleaded not guilty in the case, which is currently tied up on a pretrial appeal seeking to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. If Trump wins the presidential election in November, he wouldn’t be able to pardon state charges. And rather than attempt a legally untested self-pardon for his federal cases if he retakes the White House, Trump might instead have his newly installed attorney general — possibly Clark himself — dismiss them.

"Eyeing another Trump term, Vance leaves ACA repeal on the table",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 9:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-aca-repeal-affordable-care-act-obamacare-election-2024-rcna164892,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign announced this week that it’s investing $50 million in support of a new television ad called “Fearless.” It’s a good 30-second spot, with a fairly straightforward message. Viewers are told (a) about the Democrat’s background as a prosecutor; (b) Donald Trump’s plan to give more tax breaks to the rich; and (c) Republican plans to end the Affordable Care Act. The commercial wraps up with Harris declaring, “We are not going back.” The fact that the ad specifically referenced the ACA might’ve surprised some viewers. After all, when we think about the hot-button issues that are dominating the public discourse this year, health care isn’t widely seen as one of them. But Democrats clearly hope to change that, and the candidates on the Republican Party’s presidential ticket occasionally lend a hand. Sen. JD Vance, for example, spoke with NOTUS this week, and the report noted, the Ohio Republican “suggested repealing Obamacare would still be a priority” if voters return Trump to power. The report added that Vance went on to say in the same interview that the Trump-era “repeal and replace efforts” were “fundamentally focused around the idea of fixing what was broken, not about stripping people’s health care away. So yeah, I think you’re certainly gonna see efforts to reform the system. Obviously, what that looks like will depend a little bit on Congress because Congress has to have a role to play.” As a substantive matter, Vance’s assessment didn’t make a lot of sense. His condemnation of the ACA — which he’s too inexperienced to have voted on — not only misdiagnoses the existing challenges surrounding the Affordable Care Act, it also badly misstates what transpired during Trump’s first term. But looking ahead, what arguably matters most about Vance’s comments was the fact that he left little doubt in a Trump second term, Americans should “certainly” expect a prospective Republican White House to “reform” the nation’s health care system. “Donald Trump and JD Vance are the greatest threat to Americans’ health care today,” Harris for President spokesperson James Singer said in a statement, responding to the NOTUS interview. “Terminating the Affordable Care Act has been Trump’s goal for years, which will make America sicker, rip away preexisting condition protections from more than 100 million Americans, and increase health care costs. ... The stakes this November couldn’t be higher for the American people.” The problem, of course, goes well beyond Vance and his latest comments. Indeed, Trump largely ignored the ACA after leaving the White House, but as regular readers know, the former president had targeted Obamacare in increasingly explicit terms over the past year, and as recently as December, the Republican posted a video to his social media platform attacking the late Sen. John McCain for not helping him “terminate” the ACA in 2017. Trump soon after vowed to tear down the nation’s existing health care system and replace it with something he said would be “better” — though his assurances didn’t include any details. What’s more, as we’ve discussed, some of his congressional allies have added their voices to this debate. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told Axios in late November, “I think Obamacare has been one of the biggest deceptions on the American people. I mean just look at your health care premiums.” (Premium costs, in reality, have gone down, not up.) The same report added that Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, who’d likely chair the Senate Finance Committee if the GOP retakes control of the chamber, also said he’s open to repeal-and-replace plans. Remember, the Republicans’ 2017 effort to tear down the ACA was a disaster for the party, which Democrats exploited to help take back the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats would love little more than to have this fight again in 2024 — a recent national survey from NBC News found the party with a 23-point advantage over the GOP on health care — which made Vance’s comments this week all the more significant. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
