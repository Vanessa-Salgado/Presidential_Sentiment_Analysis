Jon Stewart’s DNC special showed exactly where his loyalty is,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-daily-show-dnc-episode-rcna167981,"Jon Stewart, who hosted “The Daily Show’s” wrap-up of the Democratic National Convention, had his work cut out for him Thursday night. To start, he had to follow the strong comedic acts that preceded him.   “I guess Donald Trump will finally know,” quipped a repentant D.L. Hughley during his address, “what it’s like when you get left for a younger woman.” That was pretty good! Not necessarily a “third-degree Ginsburn,” but a burn nonetheless.  Having Kerry Washington use two adorable small children (Vice President Kamala Harris’ grandnieces) to teach somewhat less adorable large Republican adults how to pronounce “Kamala” (i.e., Comma + La) was a masterstroke.  Stewart was also competing with the dextrous comedy duo of “Obama and Obama” that appeared the night before. The former president delivered a quip about “crowd sizes” accompanied by the type of deft physical gesture that stand-ups spend years learning how to execute. But when Michele Obama suggested Donald Trump might not even be aware that he’s actually applying for a “Black job,” well, my friends, that was a roast.  Stewart also had to deal with the technical unpredictability of covering a major live event. The production was less upended by circumstances than it was in July at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. As you might recall, the assassination attempt on Trump resulted in an extended security perimeter around the RNC, which in turn scuttled “The Daily Show’s” original on-site broadcasting plan.  Forced to abandon his Milwaukee theater at the last minute, Stewart ended up dialoguing with conservative firebrand Bill O’Reilly in New York. That disconcertingly amiable conversation led me to wonder if the host and his team had really thought through the complicated ethics of performing political comedy in dangerous times. Platforming people with anti-democratic ideas certainly has its risks, does it not?  Back to Thursday’s episode: What was Stewart, a liberal, supposed to make of the DNC’s glitzy, amped-up, eyeball-lacerating, celebrity-studded showcase? Because, let there be no doubt, that showcase was celebrating liberal values, not conservative ones and certainly not those of the far left.  There was plenty to lampoon, and it raises the question of how liberal comedians should best ply their craft. Are they partisans whose jokes must be pressed into the service of political ideology? Or, are they independent artists whose foremost responsibility is to make people laugh, ideology be damned?  This dilemma, I stress, is neither easily resolved nor even as black or white as I have framed it. In 2024 Stewart has been fairly consistent in going for the laugh at the expense of ideological conformity. That decision has, at points, incensed his critics. They argue — puritanically but not necessarily in error — that the present moment is too fraught for equal opportunity skewering. Train your fire, they exhort, on “them” not “us.”   On Thursday night, Stewart would have none of that. Still, he was measured in the way he placed his comedy in the service of jokes, not the party. That didn’t stop him, of course, from having some fun with the contradictions and erasures of today’s Democrats.  Billionaires, Stewart noted, were excoriated by Bernie Sanders. And then Chicago Gov. JB Pritzker rocked the mic (“our billionaire,” snarked Stewart).  Those who matriculate at elitist Yale University got called out by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Stewart, though, was quick to round up a raft (or heavyweight shell?) of Yalies who addressed the delegates. The Dems celebrated people who prosecuted sexual predators, and then Bill Clinton mounted the stage. Stewart wasn’t done. Palestinian Americans were nowhere to be seen or heard, but everyone else was. And, yes, there was so much pro-military chest thumping at the DNC that it was a wonder Democrats didn’t attempt a Blue Angel flyover within the United Center in Chicago. Stewart was mocking the party’s Liberal/Neo-Liberal divide, all the while suggesting it had thrown its leftist flank under the campaign bus. Half of Stewart’s liberal audience loved it. Half wished he’d shut his yapper. Half probably didn’t notice. And all were so hopped up on “joy” that they didn’t care either way. After all, what’s the alternative to Kamala? As an opening comic act, Obama and Obama served the party and comedy both. “The Daily Show,” on the other hand,  served comedy more than it served the party and the besieged liberalism it represents. In an age in which politicians act like comedians, and comedians act like journalists, Stewart’s choice seems reasonable to me. "
"As RFK Jr. ends his 2024 presidential campaign, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rfk-jr-ends-2024-presidential-campaign-happens-now-rcna168007,"For those wondering what to expect from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign, the writing has been on the wall for a while. The independent conspiracy theorist had already effectively stopped holding public events and raising money when his running mate signaled that the end of his candidacy was near. Nicole Shanahan said this week that their campaign faced a choice between continuing with its ill-fated effort — which would “risk” helping Vice President Kamala Harris, she said — or dropping out to “join forces” with Trump. The candid comments, made on a podcast, left little doubt that the Kennedy candidacy was intended to undermine the Democratic ticket. It also made clear that those expecting to see Kennedy’s 2024 candidacy persevere in the coming weeks and months needed to lower their expectations. Three days after Shanahan raised the prospect of pulling the plug on the doomed third-party campaign, the conspiracy theorist agreed to stand down. NBC News reported: Looking ahead, the obvious question is about the possible consequences. Kennedy obviously wasn’t going to win the presidential race or any electoral votes, but the anti-vaccine activist cultivated a modest following. As he exits the stage and throws his support behind Donald Trump, what happens now? On the surface, the Republican nominee has reason to be pleased. Even if Kennedy’s support had dwindled to a few percentage points, in a highly competitive race, a few percentage points is likely to make the difference between winning and losing. If recent polling puts Harris’ lead at around two points, Kennedy’s supporters could turn Trump’s deficit into an advantage. At least, that is, on the surface. Just below the surface it’s a bit more complicated. For one thing, some of Kennedy’s supporters might yet support the Democratic ticket, his Trump endorsement notwithstanding. For another, Kennedy’s base doesn’t appear to be made up of traditional voters. As a New York Times report, published before Kennedy’s announcement, explained, the independent’s backers “are less likely than others to have voted in 2020, and are also less likely to say they will vote come November.” In other words, with Kennedy out, his base is likely to splinter, and some of his fans will simply stay home in the fall. Complicating matters is that Democrats are going out of their way to tell the electorate that they’re the normal, responsible, and grown-up party in 2024, and voters should reject the fringe and the radical. It’s against that backdrop that Trump is picking up support from a fringe figure whose weird ideas made it impossible for his campaign to capitalize on months of voter dissatisfaction with Trump and President Joe Biden. Given recent events, the GOP nominee will celebrate good news where he can find it, and Trump is not in the habit of turning down endorsements from anyone. But if the former president and his allies are counting on a major boost as a result of Kennedy’s exit, they’re likely to be disappointed."
RFK Jr.'s journey from Democrat to Republican shows how Covid scrambled politics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-jr-drops-out-endorses-trump-president-election-2024-rcna167790,"Robert Kennedy Jr. announced on Friday that he has suspended his independent presidential campaign and will be endorsing former President Donald Trump. His move adds yet another twist in a presidential race filled with unexpected developments. It remains unclear how Kennedy’s withdrawal could affect the outcome of the election, and how much the move could reduce the number of voters who may have cast a ballot for him instead of Trump. More broadly, Kennedy’s maneuver is also a fascinating reflection of this ideologically topsy-turvy political era, when the Covid pandemic has scrambled American politics in unpredictable ways and turbocharged an epidemic of mistrust. Kennedy launched his campaign last year as a Democrat. On one level, that made perfect sense. Kennedy had been a lifelong member of the party, where his family remains political royalty. He worked for many years as a prominent environmental lawyer. And his presidential policy platform included some conventionally progressive ideas, such as support for unions. But on another level, it was an odd fit. Well before Covid derailed the world, Kennedy’s reputation as an environmental lawyer had been outstripped by his activism against vaccines. During the pandemic, the reach of that activism expanded dramatically. He became a superspreader of Covid-related misinformation online and his following grew specifically around that issue. Among other conspiracy theories, he claimed that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, were promoting vaccines for financial profit. Notoriously, he also argued that vaccine policies across the West were worse than Nazism. (He later sort of apologized.) Vaccine skeptics and opponents span the political spectrum, but they tend to skew conservative. It should be no surprise to hear, then, that Kennedy’s critiques of vaccine programs as totalitarian and Fauci as a tyrant resonated with plenty of people on the right. Even before he announced his campaign, his Covid-related activism influenced top Republicans’ views and messaging on vaccines. After Kennedy entered the presidential race, he was invited constantly onto high-profile right wing media platforms, even though he was running as a Democrat. And some libertarian tech moguls, skeptical of government regulation, took a liking to him. As I wrote at the time, this phenomenon could not be explained purely by a right-wing effort to boost a potential thorn in Biden’s side in the Democratic presidential primaries. It reflected that they and Kennedy were ideologically in line on issues ranging from public health to Ukraine policy to a general proclivity for conspiracy theories (including some racist ones): After failing to gain ground in the polls, Kennedy dropped out of the Democratic primaries in October. As he exited, Kennedy argued that the Democratic Party wasn’t giving him a fair shake and allowing him to debate Biden. But he also likely calculated that he could have a bigger effect on the race by entering the general election. After Kennedy went independent, polling on three-way matchups (Trump, Biden and Kennedy) initially indicated that he took a small bite out of the vote share for both candidates, and it was unclear who he’d hurt more. But over time, particularly after Biden stepped aside and Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as his successor, polling made it clear that Kennedy’s presence was a greater threat to Trump than the Democrats. That development indicates that, before Harris became the Democratic nominee, Kennedy had benefited from Biden’s weakness as a candidate. But the durability of Trump-friendly Kennedy voters also suggests that Kennedy has become a more substantive ideological competitor to Trump due to their overlapping worldviews. It makes sense, then, that Trump got into private deal-making talks with Kennedy and signaled that he’d welcome an endorsement. Kennedy’s political transformation illustrates how Covid and the government’s response to it really shook up some people’s worldview and served as a portal to new forms of political consciousness. Kennedy channeled that energy, first on the Democratic side of the aisle, and then as a free-floating independent, and now he’s using it to funnel people to the right. Kennedy’s views are deeply idiosyncratic and many of his perspectives aren’t an organic match for the MAGA right. But his most spirited — and salient — views now revolve around distrust in the medical establishment and government. Given what seems to matter to him most now, his new home makes more sense than the old one. "
Democrats' 'joyful' convention this week made a huge misstep by sidelining pro-Palestinian voices,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 12:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/dnc-gaza-kamala-harris-palestinian-uncommitted-rcna167950,"As Kamala Harris closed her acceptance speech on Thursday night to roaring applause and Beyoncé's ""Freedom"" blaring from the speakers and balloons falling from the ceiling, the elation on the arena floor could not be separated from the ways the Democratic Party engaged with its pro-Palestinian factions this week. The party had gone to lengths to silence and sideline those who spoke up about the administration's unconditional military aid to Israel and its hollow warnings about protecting civilian lives in the Gaza Strip. Delegates who unfurled a banner that said ""Stop Arming Israel"" were drowned out by chants of ""We love Joe"" and booted from the floor, The Associated Press reported. Other than a single panel on Palestinian human rights on Monday afternoon, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza received little attention. There was scant mention of the issue in speeches during the main programming, and when it came up, the horrors in Gaza were described in passive terms, as if Israel's military conduct and America's material support for it were unrelated. Harris herself spoke about the “heartbreaking” suffering in Gaza without mentioning who was responsible for the deliberate starvation of civilians, the bombings of refugee camps and schools and mosques, the fatal sniper shots to children’s heads and chests attested to by multiple doctors. The party also refused to grant the Uncommitted delegates' request for a Palestinian American to deliver remarks onstage, despite pressure from Democratic lawmakers and other outside groups. Members of the Uncommitted movement — a group within the party that aims to pressure Harris to endorse an arms embargo against Israel and a permanent cease-fire in Gaza — staged a sit-in from Wednesday evening, hoping until the eleventh hour that party leaders would change their minds. They did not. The exclusion of a Palestinian speaker from the main stage was not only a glaring political misstep, but also a moral one, and made it appear that Democrats hoped that sweeping the humanitarian crisis in Gaza under the rug would avoid putting a damper on their celebrations. (One immediate consequence was the announcement that the group Muslim Women for Harris was rescinding its support and disbanding.) This convention was an opportunity for Harris to walk the talk about Democrats as the party of inclusion and decency. It was also a chance for the party to show that supporters of Palestinian rights belonged under its big tent. In her speech on Thursday, Harris vowed to be a president “who leads and listens.” But when her party's pro-Palestinian bloc said loud and clear that they wanted a platform this week, Democrats failed them."
Why Bill Clinton’s amazing statistic about jobs and Democrats matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bill-clintons-amazing-statistic-jobs-democrats-matters-rcna167977,"When Bill Clinton spoke at the Democratic National Convention this week, he shared an economic claim that seemed implausible: In other words, over the last 35 years, employers have added roughly 51 million jobs in the United States, and 50 million of them — 98% — have been created during Democratic administrations. Is that true? Actually, yes. The claim comes with caveats (the former president didn’t have to start the clock in 1989, for example), but according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 51.5 million jobs have been added since January 1989 and roughly 1.3 million of them were created while a Republican president sat in the White House. How can that be? Well, there have been four recessions in the United States over the last 35 years: The first began in early 1990, during George H.W. Bush’s Republican administration; the second began in the spring of 2001, during George W. Bush’s Republican administration; the third (and most severe) began in late 2007, also during George W. Bush’s Republican administration; and the fourth began in the spring of 2020, during Donald Trump’s Republican administration. During that same time period, there have also been periods of rapid American job growth amid economic recoveries: Clinton’s second term, Barack Obama’s second term and Joe Biden’s first term. Given all of this and the dramatic job losses associated with the 2007 and 2020 recessions, it’s not too surprising that the Democrats-vs.-Republicans competition is lopsided. But why stop at the last 35 years? The Washington Post’s Philip Bump published a good analysis in the wake of Clinton’s convention speech and found: Longtime readers might recall that this has long been a point of curiosity for me. Marketwatch, for example, published a piece on the subject in 2015, noting that in the previous seven decades, economic growth, job growth and stock market performance have all been better under Democratic presidents. The Atlantic had a related report in 2017, adding that over the last 70 years, “the U.S. economy has been better, across many metrics, when a Democrat has been the president.” Writing for Slate way back in 2008, Michael Kinsley did some similar research. In case this isn’t obvious, since those reports were published, the results have become more favorable to Democrats, not less. It’s no wonder Clinton took the opportunity to brag. I am mindful of polls showing that many voters tend to see the Republican Party as more credible on the economy. I'm also aware of the evidence from recent history that shreds these misplaced assumptions."

Kamala Harris' DNC acceptance speech didn't overlook the Supreme Court's significance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 8:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kamala-harris-dnc-acceptance-speech-supreme-court-rcna167929,"Even if she only mentioned it a couple of times, the Supreme Court loomed large in Kamala Harris’ speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago on Thursday night. After all, she addressed two of the biggest rulings in recent years, both of which involve the Republican presidential nominee: the court’s broad grant of criminal immunity for presidents and its stripping of abortion rights.  On immunity, Harris cast the decision in Trump v. United States as the foundation for an even more dangerous second Trump term if he wins in November: “Consider the power he will have, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States.”  Harris’ general description of the ruling — “that he would be immune from criminal prosecution” — triggered some fact-checkers, who noted that the high court’s ruling is technically more complex than her summary. But while adding context about the ruling is theoretically helpful — that he’s absolutely immune for “core” constitutional acts, presumptively immune for all official acts but not immune for unofficial ones — the reality is that the extent of Trump’s immunity is yet to be determined.  The federal election interference case is now back in the trial court, where U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan will attempt to apply the new immunity test to Trump’s Washington, D.C., indictment in the first instance, after which the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority may have the last word on what its vague ruling means in practice. That is, unless Trump wins in November — in which case the prosecution is good as gone and we may never know how criminally immune the Roberts Court believes Trump to be. At any rate, Harris’ statement about Trump lacking guardrails thanks to the immunity ruling may turn out to be prescient if he’s re-elected. However vague the court’s ruling, it could provide Trump more of a roadmap for how to use the awesome power of the presidency to his personal advantage while minimizing criminal exposure. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in Trump v. United States didn’t meaningfully address Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s warning in dissent that presidents can now, for example, order Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival or organize a military coup to hold onto power with impunity.    The Democratic nominee also highlighted the high court’s wreckage on abortion: “But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear about how we got here: Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.” Indeed, Trump appointed three of the five justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022’s Dobbs decision.  Harris’ highlighting of both crucial rulings reminds us that the court is also on the ballot in November.

Former Trump spokesperson shares insight into how and why he lies,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 8:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-trump-spokesperson-shares-insight-lies-rcna167953,"In April 2020, Stephanie Grisham stepped down as Donald Trump’s White House press secretary. In August 2024, Grisham not only disavowed her former boss, she also spoke at the Democratic National Convention, telling attendees that the Republican nominee has “no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth.” But there was another part of her remarks that stood out for me. “[Trump] used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’ But it does matter — what you say matters, and what you don’t say matters.” At face value, the fact that Grisham was on the stage at all was extraordinary. Not only is Trump’s former vice president withholding his support for the Republican’s 2024 candidacy, and not only is Trump’s former White House chief of staff condemning his former boss, but Trump’s former White House press secretary and communications director appeared at the Democratic convention and explained how and why the Republican lies. But there was something familiar about what Grisham said during her remarks. As I noted in my new book, as Trump’s first year in the White House neared an end, Billy Bush wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times. Bush was not an especially notable public figure at the time, but in the infamous “Access Hollywood” record, he was the one Trump bragged to about assaulting women. (“When you’re a star, they let you do it,” the future president told Bush. “You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the p---y.”) In his 2017 op-ed, Bush reflected on what he’d learned about the then-president and shared an anecdote about a conversation he’d had with Trump about inflating the ratings of his reality-television program. Bush wrote that Trump had told him privately, “People will just believe you. You just tell them, and they believe you.” Seven years later, Grisham said something eerily similar: “[Trump] used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’” In other words, what Trump privately told Billy Bush about his willingness to lie is effectively identical to what Trump privately told his former White House press secretary about his willingness to lie. It’s a philosophy, for lack of a better word, rooted in the idea that fiction can simply overpower fact through relentless and shameless repetition. Why does the former president repeat transparent nonsense, over and over again? People close to him have already told us the answer."
Trump-owned club to host fundraiser for Jan. 6 rioters (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-owned-club-host-fundraiser-jan-6-rioters-rcna167937,"Discussion of the Jan. 6 attack did not dominate the Democratic National Convention this week, but the party certainly made an effort to remind the public about the assault on the U.S. Capitol and Donald Trump’s responsibility for the insurrectionist violence. In fact, on the third night of the DNC, attendees and viewers saw a four-minute video devoted specifically to Jan. 6. A day later, as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination, she declared, “[C]onsider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the U.S. Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite — he fanned the flames.” It was against this backdrop that The New York Times reported that a group supporting Jan. 6 criminals and defendants will soon hold a fundraising event for rioters at Trump’s golf club in New Jersey. I’m reasonably certain this news was first reported by the MeidasTouch Network. To be sure, the former president is listed on the announcement for the event as an “invited guest speaker,” though the Times’ report added that the GOP nominee does not plan to attend. The article nevertheless added, “Regardless of whether Mr. Trump will be present, it is an unusual — and potentially risky — move to permit a soiree supporting those who stormed the Capitol to be held at one of his most recognizable properties just as his presidential campaign goes full speed for its final few months.” That’s true, though it’s also worth emphasizing the familiarity of the circumstances. NBC News reported in June 2023, for example, that Trump spoke at a fundraiser on behalf of Jan. 6 criminals and defendants, held at his private golf club in Bedminster. “I’m going to make a contribution,” the former president said at the time. Two months later, NBC News ran a separate report, noting that Trump participated in a different fundraiser for Jan. 6 defendants, which was also held at his Bedminster golf club. These latest developments, in other words, are part of a pattern. The news also comes roughly three weeks after the Republican reiterated his intentions to issue pardons to convicted Jan. 6 felons — including those who assaulted police officers during the assault on the Capitol. The Associated Press reported in March that the former president has positioned “the violent siege and its failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House.” This coincided with a related Semafor report on the degree to which the Republican has put Jan. 6 rioters “at the heart of his campaign.” That was true then, and it appears to still be true now."
Trump suffers unintentionally funny meltdown on DNC’s final night,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 6:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-suffers-unintentionally-funny-meltdown-dncs-final-night-rcna167928,"If members of Donald Trump’s team had greater control of their boss, they probably should’ve tried to keep the former president distracted during the Democratic National Convention. The more the Republican’s attention could be diverted from television screens, the less likely he’d be to throw tantrums. But if that was the plan, it didn’t work. Before the final night of the DNC got underway, the former president announced that he’d offer online rebuttals to the convention by way of his social media platform. He certainly tried to do that, starting with a weird “WHERE’S HUNTER?” missive, as if Trump had briefly forgotten that there’s no longer any point in going after President Joe Biden’s son. As a New York Times report noted, the online tirades — totaling roughly 50 items — ultimately proved insufficient, prompting the GOP candidate to make a phone call. I can appreciate why the network worked quickly to get the Republican candidate on the air, albeit by telephone. Trump is, after all, the GOP nominee, and it stood to reason that he’d have something notable to say in response to his Democratic rival’s remarks.What Fox might not have realized, however, is that Harris’ convention speech had apparently caused a meltdown. Trump appeared on the air for about 10 minutes, during which time he not only raged incoherently, he also accidentally pushed random buttons on his phone. The interview — I’m using the word loosely — might’ve gone on longer, but Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum effectively cut off the former president mid-rant so that the network could move on to other programming. And while it was certainly amusing to see Fox effectively tell Trump they no longer wanted to hear him whine uncontrollably, it was even funnier when the Republican hung up with one conservative media network, only to call another.In fact, almost immediately after Trump ranted on Fox, he called Newsmax to keep the meltdown going a while longer. In a normal political party, such a meltdown would probably be seen as disqualifying. In the contemporary Republican Party, it was a tragically routine Thursday night."
"In convention speech, Kamala Harris succeeded where Trump failed",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 5:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/convention-speech-kamala-harris-succeeded-trump-failed-rcna167918,"On July 18, Donald Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention, where the former president was expected to deliver one of the most important speeches of his political career. He failed spectacularly: The GOP candidate spoke for more than an hour and a half, reminding voters of all the things they don’t like about him and failing to take advantage of a unique opportunity. Trump meandered aimlessly. He ad-libbed unnecessarily. He lied excessively. He was in equal measures divisive, bitter, juvenile, conspiratorial and alienating. The Republican nominee effectively presented a case study in how not to deliver an acceptance speech at a major party convention. Exactly six weeks later, Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Her remarks were not just a triumph on their own terms, they also succeeded where her Republican rival failed. NBC News reported: Why did her convention speech work? Harris presented herself as the change candidate: That’s not an easy thing for an incumbent vice president to pull off, but the Democrat’s “new way forward” rhetoric resonated in part because she’s running against a failed GOP candidate who’s led his party’s ticket in every election since 2016. Worse, Trump is explicitly running on a platform of taking the nation backwards, while Harris repeatedly used the word ""forward"" in her remarks. Harris reached out to a broad electorate: Six weeks after Trump’s needlessly divisive remarks, the Democratic nominee declared, “I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self.” In the same remarks, she added, “Our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past — a chance to chart a new way forward — not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” Harris was optimistic and patriotic: “[O]ur opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is,” the vice president said. “Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: Freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities. We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.” Harris sounded like a normal human being: While Trump raged on his social media platform, the Democratic nominee assured voters, “I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense.” Harris was disciplined — and didn’t go on and on: Trump’s 90-minute rant in Milwaukee sent some of his loyalists heading for the exits before it was over. The vice president’s remarks, in contrast, were half as long. The former abandoned his script to share strange thoughts that popped into his mind; the latter recognized the importance of being a disciplined candidate for the nation’s highest office. I won’t pretend to know what’s going to happen on Election Day 2024, but as the dust settles in Chicago, Harris has reason to feel good about her chances."
The GOP’s racist attacks on Kamala Harris reveal a painful paradox for people like me,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-black-indian-race-trump-rcna167777,"In her rousing Democratic National Convention address Thursday night, Vice President Kamala Harris paid homage to her mother's determination, “traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream.” I, like Harris, am a mixed-race South Asian. My father is Pakistani and my mother is Caucasian (mostly British, though born and raised in Southern Africa). And the tired racialized narratives about Harris’ identity are familiar, echoing narratives and projections about my own identity that I’ve navigated throughout my life. The untidiness of mixed-race identities and the discomfort that produces foregrounds our collective preoccupation with categorizing and ordering people, an often dehumanizing process — not to mention, a stubborn relic of the colonial episteme.  According to her detractors, Harris is either “too Black” or “too Indian” or not enough of either. In the words of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, she “is a fundamentally fake person.” “I believe that Kamala Harris is whatever she says she is,” Vance said in an interview with CNN earlier this month. “She pretends to be one thing in front of one audience. She pretends to be something different in front of another audience.” “Is Kamala a chameleon? Is she Indian?” cried former wrestling star and MAGA fanboy Hulk Hogan in a video obtained by TMZ. He followed this with a racist, so-called Native American greeting. (Hulk, are you OK?)  More than anything, these examples evince to me just how unstable racial categories are. Mixed-race folx are often reduced to a binaristic paradigm — they are either too much of one thing or not enough of either. Or, paradoxically, they are both at the same time.  Throughout my life, I have been told I am not white enough. I am not brown enough. Or I am too brown. Though, interestingly, never too white. The one-drop rule, a Jim Crow-era law which stipulated that even one drop of blood from a Black ancestor made someone Black (as though it is a contamination), seems alive and well in how we collectively define mixed-race people today — especially if you present as anything other than white. (Colorism is an entirely different dimension of this.) And these narratives insist we are “whole of nothing.” It’s important to note that Harris’ lived experience is different in a multitude of ways, not least because she is competing with being two different kinds of minorities, contending with the heavy burden of historical racism around Blackness in this country and the suspicion of being an Indian foreigner. Suffice it to say, conversations around mixed-race identity are infused with covert white supremacy. One way I encounter it, for example, is in the refusal to accept mixed-race people, who are partially white, as white.  I’ve been told by white people that I profit off of being brown (the “DEI accusation” levied by white people who feel that minorities can bypass meritocracy, which is itself a fallacy). It’s as though the world — built on tenuous, stratifying racial paradigms — cannot handle the embodiment of identities that destabilize these paradigms. We saw this discomfort play out a few weeks ago when Trump questioned whether Harris was “Black enough.”  “She was only promoting Indian heritage,” Trump said in an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “Is she Indian or is she Black?” That preposterous question perfectly captures the discomfort produced in many by the existence of mixed-race people, who embody experiences and/or identities that challenge our racial ordering.   My experience as a mixed-race person makes me reflect on racial formation theory, a framework introduced by sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant in the 1980s, which postulates “that ‘race’ is a social and political reality that remains unfixed, due to the role of institutions and groups in shaping its meaning,” sociologist Eileen O’Brien explains in “The Cambridge Handbook of Sociology.” Mixed-race people both highlight the instability of racial categories and further destabilize these ideologies. However, it’s worth noting that, like most things that emerged in the ‘80s, we should take this with a grain of salt. For example, detractors, such as sociologists Joe Feagin and Sean Elias, argue that the theory doesn’t do enough to decenter whiteness. “[R]acial formation theory inadequately explains: racial meanings and white racial framing; US society’s racial foundation; the US state and other sites of racial contestation; whites’ and white elites’ centrality in contemporary racism; challenges to a racially pluralistic democracy; and group resistance to racism, especially that of the black ‘radical’ intellectual tradition,” they write in “Rethinking Racial Formation Theory: A Systemic Racism Critique.” Nonetheless, Omi and Winant’s contributions were critical in exposing the instability and sophism of racial categories, which, of course, continue to haunt us to this day. I don’t find the current mainstream discourse around Harris (and other mixed-race folx) useful — applying racial litmus tests and debating to what extent she and others like her qualify for certain groups and identities. But I do find conversations about my identity as a mixed-race person useful when it’s self-reflexive and when they help situate me in terms of intersectionality. For example, I’m interested in discussing how being half-white provided me with the cultural capital that helped me be admitted into and navigate the elite institutions I’ve attended for my undergraduate and graduate studies, even as I’m read as brown. Being half-white has afforded me extraordinary privileges. But/and how much was my drive to attend such institutions born from a compensatory and perfectionist part, burdened by my own experiences with racism, that believes I am less-than because I am brown and that I must excel in order to be worthy?  My brother and I had many of the same socioeconomic privileges as my white cousins, for example, which my brown cousins have not had. Conversely, we were unable to visit South Africa, where my mother was primarily raised, and meet my family there until after 1994, because of apartheid and the enforced segregation. My white cousins were able to make that trip years before my brother and I were. The point is, it’s messy and complex and nuanced.  These are the kinds of mainstream conversations that I believe we should be having about Harris’ identity, through the prism of intersectionality — conversations that allow us to interrogate shifting power dynamics and the instability of racial categories. This, I believe, would serve us all well. But questioning whether Harris is Black enough or Indian enough is not in service of anything — except white supremacy."
This photo of Gus Walz was a teachable moment. Republicans missed it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-son-gus-dnc-crying-rcna167870,"This week’s Democratic National Convention has breathed life and hope into this current election cycle and taught lessons that have left so many of us newly energized for the months and years ahead. But no one could have imagined that a 17-year-old boy, with an unbridled display of pride for his father, would show the nation precisely what it looks like when a child has been raised with a healthy model of masculinity. As Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz highlighted his family’s struggles with infertility during his speech accepting the Democratic nomination for vice president, his son, Gus, stole the show. Gus, through tears and cheers, gave his father a standing ovation and pointed toward the stage while yelling, “That’s my dad!” Predictably, social media lapped it up. My own heart melted as I read those posts. However, there’s unfortunately another side to social media — another side to society overall. It’s the one that pathologizes boys and men who dare to express tender emotions. Indeed, people on this side came out in droves to belittle the special moment Gus publicly shared with his dad. Conservative media pundit Ann Coulter weighed in on the exchange in an ill-advised attempt to lob back a description that Democrats have effectively affixed to today’s Republicans. I’m sad for Coulter and others who’ve come out of the woodwork to mock Gus expressing love for his father. One is forced to assume that Coulter, and those like her who made remarks too awful to mention, are unfamiliar with the deep, unbridled love and joy that was on display between father and son. Jealousy, they say, breeds contempt. The exchange between Walz and his son is meaningful for reasons bigger than them and bigger than politics. When I was a public school teacher, I was surrounded by boys who were socially conditioned to use profanity and their fists to express emotion. I saw first-hand how the behavioral issues that emerged in my classroom and school were a product of boys who were not allowed to feel the full range of emotions available to human beings. They certainly were not allowed to feel tender, more vulnerable emotions publicly. Profanity and fists took precedence over tears, hugs and even kindness, almost every time. Remarkably, such belligerent displays also took precedence over joy. Every teacher probably has a story about seeing a boy who chose aggression to display happiness. I remember seeing a boy shove another boy into a wall when the principal announced a snowstorm was coming and school was closing early. To be clear, the boy doing the shoving was happy at the news. As a career educator, I continue to witness boys conditioned to display a toxic, aggressive version of masculinity. It’s the kind exemplified by the sort of brazen selfishness, cruelty and misogyny that was amplified during Donald Trump’s term as president.  The only appropriate response to adult men who know of no other way to be men is pity. Sadly, many boys today behave no differently from the way boys behaved when I was a child in the 1980s and '90s. Crying remains verboten, even if, we’re hearing the worst of the internet say, those tears accompany giving one’s own father a deeply emotional display of love and joy.   In a brief amount of time, Walz has offered us a clear alternative to the subpar, and I dare say pathetic, “masculine” identities that have historically been available to boys and men. Walz shows us that men can be hunters, fishermen and football coaches while also championing reproductive rights and advocating for the humanity of LGBTQ folks. A man can be a decorated veteran and legislate for free feminine products in schools. A man can fix a car and teach his son that there exists a joy and pride so deep that the only thing a boy can do is clap and cry. Walz and his wife, Gwen, raised a joyful son. The result of their raising him that way is a young man who knows that healthy boys aren’t afraid to cry and they’re not afraid to show love. There’s a lot at stake in this election — perhaps more at stake than any other election in American history. I might be naive, but I wonder if Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz, and the examples set by their families, have the power to change how we think about boys and men. I hope that their efforts create more joyful opportunities to usher in conversations about a new, healthier and sustainable masculinity."
The Democratic and Republican conventions told very different stories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democratic-republican-conventions-differences-rcna167651,"The Democratic and Republican national conventions this year may as well have been for different countries. Although the two parties typically have different messaging and contrasting overall vibes during their conventions, their dramatically different approaches this year laid bare the canyon-sized divide between them. The Democratic National Convention, which concluded Thursday night, exuded vitality, optimism and competence. The Republican National Convention in July leaned on fear, anger and falsehoods. “We have so much more in common than what separates us that none of us, none of us, has to fail for all of us to succeed,” declared official Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Her aspirational, 37-minute address was a strong contrast to Republican nominee Donald Trump's 93-minute acceptance speech, which was full of self-pity, meandering asides and references only his die-hard fans would understand. Another glaring gap was the energy in the room. On Tuesday, the Democrats turned the usually dull roll call into a chance to celebrate the diversity of each state and territory with handpicked songs and surprises like rapper Lil Jon representing Georgia, turning a mundane bit of housekeeping into a full-blown house party. Compare that to the Republican National Committee’s lugubrious roll call last month. It kicked off with House Speaker Mike Johnson reminding delegates to remain orderly, before the convention’s secretary proceeded to slog through over an hour of votes that made Trump’s nomination feel mundane to the point of somber, even bleak. The parade of mostly white men casting their delegates’ votes for Trump reflected the homogeneity of the MAGA party, and was at odds with the diversity that makes America strong. Then there’s the competence, and lack thereof, on display at the two events. I know from experience as a former Republican National Committee chairman that a convention needs to be tightly choreographed to project a party competent enough to lead America into the future. The Republican convention’s first night got off to a slow start when Johnson abruptly left the stage after a teleprompter malfunction heavily delayed the proceedings, leaving the cover band Sixwire to entertain the audience amid the technical difficulties. Meanwhile, showrunners of the Democratic convention were able to perfectly time the roll call’s conclusion to the moment Harris took the stage at a campaign rally in Milwaukee 80 miles away, allowing her to seamlessly address both audiences at once. But the differences ran deeper than that. Consider the vision each party presented of what a prosperous America looks like. The crowd at the Republican convention was punctuated by a sea of signs reading “MASS DEPORTATION NOW,” while Democratic signs praised American workers and unions. Republican convention speakers painted their Democratic neighbors as “a clear and present danger to America,” while the Democratic convention platformed Republicans like Ana Navarro and even a former Trump White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. These speakers highlighted how issues that affect one group affect us all. They presented an America befitting of its original national motto, e pluribus unum: “Out of many, one” — while the MAGA party continued to promote a false patriotism that paints neighbors as enemies and prosperity as a zero-sum game. But the most obvious difference is also the defining one: the difference between the two candidates each party has embraced as its nominee. While Harris presented the America her mother immigrated to with a dream of curing cancer, Trump expressed a longing to usher in “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.” Harris acknowledged the importance of putting country over party, while Donald stoked more division. Harris vowed that “between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs.” Trump promoted more lies about the 2020 election. Despite the pomp and circumstance of a party convention, it’s this difference that’s the most urgent, because it’s the choice the American people will face in November. It’s the election that will decide whether our better natures win over dangerous paranoia. It’s the choice that will determine whether the rally cry of “We’re not going back” defines America’s future or is just another catchy campaign slogan.

Kamala Harris wasn’t taking any chances in her DNC speech — but that’s why it worked,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 10:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-acceptance-speech-dnc-democratic-convention-rcna167674,"The 2024 Democratic National Convention is over, and despite fears of intraparty fighting and violent clashes between police and protesters outside the United Center — this was not a replay of 1968. In fact, Lil Jon’s roll call cameo notwithstanding, it was about as basic as political conventions get. And that’s probably the best Democrats could hope for.  The crowd in Chicago’s United Center roared as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for president. It’s a historic moment and one that clearly inspired a lot of emotion. The cameras found more than a few non-dry eyes in the house.  But like the convention itself, Harris’ speech was successful in large part because she played it kind of safe.  She wished her husband, “Dougie” Emhoff, a happy 10th anniversary. She told a compelling personal story about being a child of immigrants who traveled the world to work for the American dream — and succeeded. And she spoke about her distinguished career as a prosecutor who always showed up “for the people.” Then there was the Donald Trump part of the speech. Here, Harris hit the necessary notes — reminding voters that Trump “tried to throw away your votes” during his monthslong attempt to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. And, oh yeah, that he’s been convicted of felonies and found liable for sexual abuse. (I know we’re almost a decade into the Trump era, but it still blows my mind how these brief nuggets of his recent bio are seen as little more than campaign talking points by much of the American electorate.) Harris also highlighted arguably Trump’s most important political victory — getting three justices onto the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Harris spoke of the consequences of Trump’s legacy, including “women miscarrying in a parking lot, getting sepsis, losing their ability to ever have children again, all because doctors are afraid of going to jail for caring for their patients.” And, in a callback to one of the most affecting segments of the DNC, Harris spoke of “children who have survived sexual assault, potentially forced to carry the pregnancy to term. This is what is happening in our country. Because of Donald Trump.”  Harris’ rhetorical assaults on Trump were absolutely the high point of the speech. She articulated the verifiable threats Trump poses to democracy, the global order and the rights of everyday Americans in succinct, pugnacious fashion.  When it came to policy specifics, it didn’t sound like much of a departure from Joe Biden’s agenda. There was lots of talk about “the middle class” and Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires.  But Harris was completely vague about building what she called an “opportunity economy” that, under her leadership, would bring together “labor and workers, small-business owners and entrepreneurs, and American companies.” How she’d bring together these often competing forces — and what “bringing together” even means — remains unexplained.  And on an evening dubbed by some social media smart alecks as “normie night” — the one night when less partisan people would likely be tuned in — the program was stuffed with police officers, ex-Republicans, moderates and foreign policy tough talk.  In this vein, Harris assured the normies that, unlike Trump, she would not abandon NATO and that “as commander in chief I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Republicans have for decades portrayed Democrats as lacking the killer instinct to deal with the worst actors on the international stage. This was Harris’ moment to let the undecideds know that she understands the threats posed by Iran and China, while adding that she wouldn’t be reckless and impulsive with that power — like Trump. Then came the Gaza part of the speech. The lack of a Palestinian American speaker or any representative from the Uncommitted delegation was the elephant in the room, and after a staunch defense of Israel’s right to defend itself and a condemnation of the terrorist organization Hamas, Harris spoke of the civilian suffering in Gaza. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” Again, when getting specific, it didn’t appear that Harris’ policy is any different from Biden’s: “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity. Security. Freedom. And self-determination.”  Team Harris is most likely hoping that her stated commitments to work for a cease-fire and a Palestinian state — especially given the fact that her opponent openly uses the word “Palestinian” as an insult — will be enough to temporarily quell the dissatisfaction from the party’s progressive wing and get it out to vote in November. We will, fairly soon, find out. Over the course of four often long nights, Harris and Democrats made history this week. Along the way, America heard from Oprah, America’s new favorite high school football coach, Tim Walz, and the party’s rising stars, like Govs. Wes Moore and Josh Shapiro. But with Nov. 5 just 74 days away, there is very little room for error. And if the convention and Harris’ acceptance speech are indications, Democrats know full well they cannot afford to make any mistakes between now and the election."
Highlights and analysis of Kamala Harris’ speech on the final day of the 2024 DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 9:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/kamala-harris-speech-dnc-live-updates-rcna165595,"This was a DNC that actually felt worth watching, one that put some of the rising luminaries to the forefront and jazzed up even some of the most cynical people I know. It’s something that would have been hard to imagine just a month ago, but the energy and momentum is there. Now that we’re finally past both conventions, it’s up to the Harris campaign to continue working to capture this lightning and channel all that energy into getting voters to the ballot box in November. Jacob Soboroff speaking on MSNBC moments ago: This felt like a convention about neighbors, friends and family, whereas — and this is no secret, I’ve said it many times before — the Republican Convention was straight-up deeply disturbing.  There was one moment at that convention that made that crystal clear and that was thousands of people holding up signs that said ""mass deportations now."" The Republican Party’s platform literally consists of removing over 10 million people from the United States of America, many of whom are our neighbors, our friends and our families.  Both conventions talked about neighbors, friends and family. The Republicans said we want to remove millions of them from this country in a deportation effort with a magnitude bigger than the 1954 operation run by Dwight D. Eisenhower, with the name so racist and so offensive I don’t think it’s appropriate to say on television. The Republicans were proud of that. At the end of that convention, I remember standing in front of the stage with balloons bouncing off my head and it just felt bizarre, like we were in a bizarro world where they were having a party while we talked about kicking out people who are the fabric of the United States of America.  Here you looked at the stage and that looked like a family. That’s the fabric of the United States of America. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: This was joyful. It was full of love. People watching were like, where has that amazing person been for the last couple of years? That's a lot of what I’m getting in text messages from right now. But it's also the biggest moment to remind the American public that this is ultimately still an election where Kamala Harris is running against Donald Trump.  That’s part of why there's this big coalition of current Republicans, former Republicans, sheriffs, people who don’t normally come to these things because this election is not the norm. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. One line that stands out in re-reading the speech captures a key difference between Harris’ vision of America and Trump’s. Telling the story of how her single mother relied on neighbors and friends to help raise her and her sister, Harris said these aunts and uncles were “none of them, family by blood, and all of them, family by love.” Trump has also referenced “blood,” notably saying in December that undocumented immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” a line that uncomfortably echoed the “blood and soil” rhetoric of white supremacists. Harris has also represented her vision through her own family, which includes two stepchildren, and her calls for the protection of the rights of of LGBTQ families. Symone Sanders-Townsend speaking on MSNBC moments ago: For this current Republican party apparatus, the culture wars are not just a distraction: they are the playbook. Donald Trump and JD Vance would love nothing more than for Vice President Harris to stand on that stage and say, elect me because you will make history.  She’s not saying that. She’s saying elect me for all of these other reasons. Elect me because I’m decent, because I’ll fight for you, because I know what needs to be done and because I respect America. She’s essentially saying, elect me because I am a patriot and the other guy is not. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Ari Melber speaking on MSNBC moments ago: For years, we’ve known her as the vice president but tonight, America got to meet Harris for the role she’s played most of her career: representing the people.  It was a home run of a speech. What we heard was her give the opening statement: here’s who I am, here’s where I come from and these are my values. Then she made the case against Donald Trump and she made it more directly and more bluntly than we’ve heard throughout this inclusive and joyous convention. She needed to do that because that’s what candidates do.  So for all the joy, she hit him hard legally — she spoke about Jan. 6, democracy and fraud. She also made a point to say something that’s legally true, that Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse. That is something that fewer people have said from the main stage — that, again, is the Kamala Harris we know from being the tough prosecutor. Then third, we got the closing argument, broadening back out to the message: we can do this together, I'm proud to be American, we’re not going back. In each of those chapters, we got what you would get from her in the courtroom — and she’s good at it. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Harris demonstrated some elite storytelling ability tonight. It felt like the nation was becoming more acquainted with her as she told stories of her parents’ background and her upbringing. And when it comes to the sheer politics, she showed she’s very skilled at weaving her personal background into discussions about voter issues. Whether she was discussing her mom’s experience as a health professional, how her parents’ reverence for the civil rights movement prepped her for a legal career, or the pride her family and their neighbors had in homeownership, she told a relatable story about the positive role that the government has played in her family and the good things it can do for others. It’s a markedly different approach than Trump and the GOP are taking — and with much better delivery, too. Harris has gotten a lot better at giving speeches. As a former prosecutor, she was always good when cross-examining a witness in a Senate hearing, but her big set-piece speeches weren’t as good. Whether it’s practice from her time as vice president or having better speechwriters, she did a solid job at the podium tonight. The one thing that stuck out to me was the dissonance between the joyousness at the convention and the Democratic Party’s treatment of its pro-Palestinian factions. Party leaders snubbed the Uncommitted movement and the delegates who spoke up about their demand for an arms embargo against Israel were booted from the floor. How the party dealt with their own this week spoke volumes, and it certainly won’t go unnoticed among undecided voters for whom Gaza is a major issue. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Just to draw a contrast, tonight, what was Donald Trump doing? He was posting on media things like “where’s Hunter?” and “no, Tim Walz wasn’t coach, he was assistant coach.” And that’s funny, but it’s also not. It’s actually pretty devastating. So people will of course ask, was Harris' speech perfect? But look at what she’s running against. It's darkness and fear vs. optimism and light. And that’s what she offered tonight, not just optimism and light but real policy and a vision for the country. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We’ve talked a lot over the course last couple of days about how Democrats are trying to reclaim patriotism. I feel like it culminated in this night.  There are these gigantic flags. There’s The Chicks singing the Star Spangled Banner.  There’s the thesis that came into full flower tonight with Kamala Harris making the argument that the true strength, the true integrity, the true patriotism, lies in the Democratic Party. They have opened the flaps of the tent to encompass Republicans, to encompass doubters, to encompass people who felt culturally divorced from the party for decades and here we have one of the broadest, deepest, most diverse coalitions I have ever seen. All of them marching under the stars and stripes. It’s really something else. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Women were so present in this convention, in a way they were absent in the Republican National Convention because they were trying to avoid the whole abortion conversation.  But it isn’t just on reproductive rights, it was the idea of mom, of mommy, of motherliness that's been woven throughout this convention. Whether it was Michelle Obama talking about losing her mom or the many women talking about having the choice on how to create families. The way they’ve described family and mothers has been very unique and interesting. As well as the way they’ve defined manhood and masculinity. I still can’t get over Tim Walz's son, I think that is still sticking with so many people. It’s a really modern sort of conception of the family.  Between that moment and this night of hearing Kamala Harris and her sister Maya talk about their mom, I definitely feel like this was an embrace of motherhood by choice, whether it's a stepmom or a blended family. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump ran a one-man live blog tonight, firing off more than 40 posts (yes, I counted) on Truth Social, starting from the moment she walked onstage. He criticized her on immigration, on reproductive rights — “I TRUST WOMEN, ALSO, AND I WILL KEEP WOMEN SAFE!“ — on the economy, and much more. “IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” he asked at one point. Well, yes. After the balloon drop, the convention ended with a benediction from two speakers who hit on the Harris campaign theme of freedom. Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt of Washington D.C.’s Adas Israel Congregation, began with a reference to the book of Exodus, saying “God brought us out of the narrow place of oppression to freedom.” Lawrence O'Donnell speaking on MSNBC moments ago: My experience listening to Kamala Harris began when tonight’s host of the convention, Kerry Washington, asked me “Would you like to meet the female Obama?” This was in 2009, in the first months of the Obama presidency. And so we went along with Reggie Hudlin, who coincidentally produced some of the films in this convention, to listen to the San Francisco district attorney. And it’s one of those moments that’s clearly once in a lifetime. I was sitting there realizing I am seeing the first Black woman president, no question about it. ""Star power"" is a Hollywood phrase, but it’s a real thing. Every once in a while there is someone who yes, has all the resume stuff, but then there’s this other thing. And it’s that star power. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Harris’ speech wrapped up after about 40 minutes, less than half the amount of time it took Trump to deliver his speech, which lasted more than 92 minutes and made for the longest convention acceptance speech in history. It may seem trivial, but I continue to believe that this difference between Trump — who has been known to deliver some exhaustingly long speeches — and Harris speaks to a respect that the Democrat has for her audience that Republican seems to lack. She delivers speeches that are fairly short and to the point, as if she and her supporters have places to be. Trump drones on with speeches — sometimes for hours at a time — like he knows his fans have an endless amount of time to give him, or like nobody has anything else better to do. Nicolle Wallace speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I think there was some incorrect analysis out there that Harris somehow had to pass the commander-in-chief test. But what she did tonight was disqualify Donald Trump from ever being the country’s commander-in-chief. She said, “Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important election in our lives, it’s the most important in the life of our nation.” You take her speech and you take some of these lines from former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, who said that every president since World War II, Republican and Democrat, shared the belief that America must protect democracy in the world. Every president has honored our veterans and their sacrifices. Every president but one. You add Adam Kinzinger and Congressman Ruben Gallego and their indictments of Trump’s disrespect and disregard for members of the military, especially those who have been injured or died in service to the country, they were scathing. Those indictments were elevated on the biggest stage in American politics and I think they closed the door in the minds of anyone watching on Donald Trump ever passing the commander-in-chief test again. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Voters who had hoped that Harris would strike a different tone on Gaza likely came away disappointed tonight. The vice president said she and Biden are “working around the clock” for a hostage deal and a ceasefire. She affirmed her support for Israel’s right to defend itself and said she will always ensure its ability to do so. She condemned Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks and the “unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people” at the Nova music festival. But on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Harris adopted more passive language. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating,” she said, declining to specifically call out Israel’s role in the suffering and death. “So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again.”  This portion of this speech will also not placate the “Uncommitted” movement, which had slammed Harris and the DNC more broadly for failing to feature any Palestinian American speakers this week. Harris’ failure to draw a meaningful distinction between her and Biden’s view on the issue tonight will certainly be noted. As you may have noticed, there was not a special appearance from Mrs. Beyonce Knowles-Carter tonight. Dozens of attendees who wore “Cowboy Kamala” fits tonight for nothing are likely devastated at the lack of an appearance from the superstar. This despite TMZ promising us that she would be performing, as did several dozen random people on social media who insisted that she was there in Chicago. Look, I don’t know who started this rumor. Maybe it was a bored convention staffer whose deadpan is a little too dry to have their sarcasm register. Maybe it was James Taylor in revenge for having his number cut on Night 1 of the DNC. Maybe it was some evil genius on the Harris team who figured out a way to get people to tune in who might not otherwise watch and stay until the balloons have dropped.  In the end, we are all the more deceived for tonight’s ruse. But, if you really think about it, what is a recording of Beyonce’s “Freedom,” the campaign’s anthem that played at the close of Harris’ speech, if not a “performance?” Given her accelerated campaign launch, Harris has not released as many detailed proposals on what she would do as president as normal. She also has benefited both from Trump’s similarly thin agenda and the conservative Project 2025 proposal, which goes into excessive detail on a number of proposals that poll terribly. So I listened intently to her acceptance speech for hints of what she might do as president. Here are the specific promises: • Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act • Pass the Freedom to Vote Act • Pass the bipartisan border security bill that was scuttled earlier this year • Pass a middle-class tax cut that would help more than 100 million Americans • Work for a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza Others were more like broad goals than proposals, including lowering the cost of “everyday needs”; providing access to capital for small-business owners; building a strong middle class; ending the housing shortage; stopping cuts to Social Security and Medicare; ensuring that America leads in space and artificial intelligence; and creating an “earned pathway to citizenship” for undocumented immigrants. While everyone wonders how in the world this Beyoncé performance rumor took hold so deeply, why not read these fun balloon drop facts? “With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act,” Harris said. Well, that’s true but it’s going to take another Democratic trifecta in Washington next year to do it. Moreover, it’s going to take her fully supporting the Senate reforming (or, better yet, killing) the filibuster to do so. Harris and other Democrats have hit Trump hard the last few nights over his decision to kill a bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate negotiated. “Here is my pledge to you: As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed. And I will sign it into law,” Harris said. “We can create an earned pathway to citizenship —  and secure our border.” Yeah, I’m sorry but … the immigration bill is bad. Like, I get that there was, and is, a real desire to stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum across the border. But the bill that was negotiated focused entirely on the “border security” side of the equation and dropped the citizenship side entirely. In doing so, it didn’t just continue the failed immigration politics of the last 20 years, it made them worse. Harris just went on an extended riff on one of her favorite campaign themes: freedom. Borrowing a bit of rhetoric long used by Republicans (remember “freedom fries”?), Harris has sought to recast Democratic priorities as issues of freedom, including gun control, LGBTQ rights, climate change and voting rights. In her speech, she said: I’ve written more about her use of “freedom” — including the Beyoncé campaign song — here. Harris drew a distinct contrast between Democrats and Republicans — read: Trump — on reproductive rights. She also vowed to sign legislation to restore reproductive freedom at the federal level.   “Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom and now he brags about it,” she said. “And one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don’t trust women? Well, we trust women.” The entire week has built to this moment. We have heard from so many people who have known Harris throughout her life, and their words and anecdotes have contextualized and added depth and humanity to her profile. However, nothing is more important than the vice president telling her own story in her own words. This is the largest audience Harris may have this election, and it was critical to start tonight talking about her family, where she is from and what shaped her. She did that. But she did more than that. The VP’s story has pieces that everyone can identify with — moving around a lot as a child, watching her parents split up when she and her sister were young, growing up in a middle class community, living as the daughter of immigrants. Lots of people can literally see themselves in the journey of her life. When she accepted the nomination on behalf of all of those various communities and individuals, she elevated the conversation. The start of her speech made something big very clear: tonight is about all of America. Biden would often refuse to give Trump the dignity of using his name when referring to him in speeches. “The other guy” or “the former guy” littered his speeches. Harris on the other hand is leaning into calling out Trump directly. She also called out the threat he would entail should he return to power, without taking the dark tone that her boss has used when making similar warnings. I loved that line Harris delivered connecting her parents’ reverence for civil rights figures with her choice to become a lawyer. ""My parents had met at a civil rights gathering, and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker-Motley — those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America.” Over on The ReidOut Blog, I’ve written over the past couple years about Donald Trump and the conservative movement’s attacks on Black lawyers — like Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Harris is on that list as well. And her reference to the esteemed Black lawyers who came before her is a reminder of the conservative movement’s assault on Black civic and civil participation.  It’s been nearly a decade since Trump rode his golden escalator into American political life, and Harris is betting that people are ready to move on. Even though she’s served in the current administration for the last four years, the first thing that Harris said after accepting the nomination was that she was ready to turn the page. “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward,” she said. “Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” That’s the kind of line that you give at the end of a two-term presidency from the opposing party, not from a sitting vice president. But Trump has never really left, and Harris thinks Americans are ready to be done with him. I wrote earlier tonight about how this DNC has been a celebration of being a Democrat. The convention then proceeded to give prime speaking slots to a Republican, a cop and former military officials who could tout Harris as the next commander-in-chief. I saw plenty of complaints about this online, but it does make sense to me when you consider who the audience has been over the course of the last week. It’s been the diehard nerds like me and you fine folks reading this live blog who’ve been watching since the first night. Contrast that with the people who are less tuned in, likely more moderate, and are considering whether to vote for Harris and only taking a look tonight. If the idea is to invite those who are still considering voting for Trump, or might stay home if Harris is too liberal for them, to back Harris, then I get why they wanted to load up tonight with the most moderate to conservative elements backing her. Do I agree with this strategy? It’s hard to say. I get the logic, but I think there’s something to be said for pushing hard on the ways that Democrats are the party that will help them out the most on the night that the most eyeballs are watching live. This race is going to come down to turnout, getting people to show up to the polls or fill out their mail ballots. Trump has given up on that concept in favor of warning about nonexistent mass electoral fraud. Democrats are banking on convincing some of those who consider themselves independents, who are honestly more likely conservative, who are disillusioned with Trump to come out and support Harris instead. I’d prefer, though, if that didn’t come with frustrating those who spent the last several nights feeling a sense of pride in being a Democrat that had been lacking not just a few months ago, but over the last few decades. The bio section of the speech more than checked the box. It was a skillful effort of telling her own individual story while also making it about others and allowing people to connect with her personally. Harris stood in front of thousands and thousands of Democrats and delivered the lines they had all been waiting for this week: “On behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be President of The United States of America.” Harris told the story of her friend Wanda Kagan, who confided in Harris that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather in high school. “And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us. And she did,” Harris said. “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor — to protect people like Wanda.” A Montreal native, Kagan met Harris when the vice president lived in Canada during her teenage years. Kagan told Fox 5 recently about how Harris and her mother helped her when she was going through an abusive situation at home. The two lost touch after high school, but Kagan said she reached out after seeing Harris on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" years later, and they “picked up like time stood still.” “I know she impacted my life, that I may not be where I am today had it not been for her intervention back then, but to hear that I impacted her life too, was really, really special,” Kagan added. Harris began her speech by taking the torch from Biden, who did, in the end, pass it, but not without some drama along the way. “To our president, Joe Biden, when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude,” she said. “Your record is extraordinary as history will show, and your character is inspiring and Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both.” The shoutout only highlighted the fact that Biden, who spoke on Monday, was not at the convention Thursday. Earlier in the evening, Biden tweeted a photo of him and Jill watching the convention on TV. Harris walked out on stage to loud cheers that went on for what felt like a while — so much so that after several minutes and multiple “thank yous,” Harris tried to quiet the applause by saying: “Let’s get to business.” Harris thanked her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, at the top of her speech. It's a special day not only because she's making history as the first Black woman and first Asian American to be nominated for president but also because it's her 10th wedding anniversary. She wished a teary ""Dougie"" a happy anniversary and he blew her a kiss back as his daughter, Ella, pat his shoulder. It is prime time on the final night of the DNC and one of the main speakers is … a Republican. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., has stood alongside Democrats against Trump since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and served as one of two Republicans on the House committee investigating the attack. He spent his speech calling out his own party for abandoning conservatism in favor of Trumpism. And he invited fellow Republicans to vote for Harris for the values that they share with her over those they don’t with Trump: Adam Kinzinger’s speech tonight was just another reminder that, unlike the Republican convention in Milwaukee, this convention is about reaching out to a broader base of people in the country. It was about speaking to all people and not just one narrow wing of one party. And a consistent theme of reclaiming freedom.  As Kinzinger said, “The Democrats are as patriotic as us. They love this country just as much as we do.” The convention has been full of Republican speakers, sheriffs, former Republicans and people who still identify as Republicans. It's about inviting people to be a part of a movement and including them, which is not just the right feel-good thing to do, it's a smart political strategy. Actor and Democratic National Convention stalwart Eva Longoria used English, Spanish and Spanglish to tout Harris in her speech tonight. As with other convention speakers who know Spanish, Longoria threw in some Spanish as she was speaking, noting at one point that Americans are one big family, adding “somos familia” afterward. But then she went further and used Spanglish, that cringey American amalgam of both languages familiar from high-school Spanish classes, chain Mexican restaurant advertisements and awkward conversations. “In the Latino community, in our community, we have a saying ‘si se puede,’ which means ‘yes, we can,’” she said, citing the Obama-era slogan. “But tonight, I’m hear to tell you, ‘Yes, she can,’ so we’re going to say ‘she, se puede.’” That was a pretty powerful moment from Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Marine veteran, who capped off a series of Arizona-based speakers with a speech focused on the valor of military service and the importance of providing aid for veterans.  Gallego invited veterans onstage who have gone into politics — people he said come from city halls and state capitols, as well as the U.S House and Senate. Democrats like Rep. Ted Lieu of California, Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Illinois and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona all joined Gallego as he denounced Trump for disrespecting veterans. I have been to a lot of conventions, including the 2008 Obama convention in Denver (and that one was pretty great). But this one feels the most joyful, the most authentic, and the most connected to the big, diverse country we all live in. Part of it is removing some of the formality, bringing in more fun, changing up the programming, and making sure there are surprises. “Big Gretch” was the jolt that this night needed after a few low energy segments. The Michigan governor was charming, effusive, and hit Trump hard again and again in her speech. When it became clear that Biden might actually have to drop out of the race earlier this summer, Whitmer’s name was one of those floated to replace him as the nominee. She ultimately declined to challenge Harris once he stepped aside. But if this speech is any indication, Whitmer is going to be a strong potential contender eight years from now. Leon Panetta is a guy who has done pretty much every job in Washington. He took the stage to bolster Harris’ foreign policy cred as a former Defense secretary and CIA director. (He was also a congressman from California and chief of staff to Bill Clinton.)  Harris “understands what our military is for. The role of our military is to defend us from foreign enemies. It is not to threaten Americans, and as sure as hell, isn’t to put immigrants in camps.” This is in reference to Trump’s plans to use the military on American soil to conduct his promised “largest deportation program in history” and break up peaceful protests. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia took the stage alongside shooting survivors and victims’ family members as each of them spoke about how gun violence has affected them: Abbey Clements, a teacher who survived the Sandy Hook shooting; Kimberly Mata-Rubio, a mother whose daughter was killed in the Uvalde school shooting; Melody McFadden, who as a child witnessed her mother’s fatal shooting by an abusive partner and whose niece was killed by a stray bullet on Myrtle Beach in 2014; and Edgar Vilchez, a college sophomore who saw his classmate get killed in a drive-by shooting in 2022.  Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, a gun control activist, also gave a spirited speech. Giffords resigned from Congress in 2012 after being shot in the head during a mass shooting and assassination attempt. “I learned to walk again one step at a time. I learned to talk again one word at a time,” she said. “My friend Kamala will be a great president. She is tough. She has grit,” Giffords added. “Kamala can beat the gun lobby. She can fight gun trafficking.” Democrats wondering whether Harris made the right choice in her running mate had a good chance to check out one of the top contenders on Thursday. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly was the Washington insiders’ pick for most likely running mate due to his compelling personal biography and status as a swing-state senator. But his speech Thursday was workmanlike at best. He had a nice line about having to follow his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and singer Pink, but he didn’t sell it particularly well. The rest of the speech wasn’t particularly exciting. He spoke about the importance of teamwork and cited his experience as a U.S. Navy combat pilot and an astronaut.  If anyone was wondering if Harris should have picked Kelly instead, he didn’t give them any new reason in this speech. Mark Kelly shows why he wasn’t chosen to be the vice president nominee. He has honorably served the country, but he lacks any of the charisma or wow factor that is necessary in politics today. His dry performance tonight, in contrast to the raucous Walz speech last night, really makes you appreciate how big a whiff that would have been. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who took himself out of the search for a running mate, also gave a workmanlike speech that didn’t change anyone’s mind about Harris’ ultimate pick. Alecia Beth Hart Moore, better known as the modern icon Pink (or, P!nk), has been recording bangers for the last quarter decade. Yes, that is not a typo. But Pink’s longevity is only one part of her impressive legacy. More than the tens of millions of albums sold and world tours completed, it’s Pink’s pioneering brand of popp-y, punk-y empowerment that has always made her stand out. Years before it was common, or cool, Pink was penning anthems that reassured young women and girls everywhere that they mattered; that they were enough.  She pushed back, hard, on unrealistic beauty standards, George W. Bush and misogyny. She refused to apologize for her sexuality, her politics, her hair or her attitude. She spawned a generation of fans — myself included — who revered her authenticity, her passion and her talent. And that’s to say nothing of her live performances. Find me another pop star in her 30s who performs a Cirque du Soleil show while belting. I’ll wait. Tonight, she performed her rallying cry single “What About Us” with her daughter Willow Sage. And it was pretty “f----- perfect.” I’ll admit, even though my family still lives in Flint, Michigan, I hadn’t heard about Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson until tonight. He recounted the time in 2020 when, at the height of the George Floyd protests, he had his officers put down their riot gear to march with protesters in Flint Township. (Flint Township, I’ll note for accuracy’s sake, is a suburb of Flint itself.) It’s good to see that Swanson has kept that same energy four years later, as he compared that act with Trump’s actions on Jan. 6. He further added that Harris “has served America by keeping us safer, and I can testify firsthand that where I come from, crime is down.” Those are the kind of stats that Trump didn’t bother mentioning when he was in Michigan earlier this week, an hour away in Howell, to lie about crime. Comedian D.L. Hughley just took the stage and torched Trump as only a comedian could. The key headline from Hughley’s speech was his apology for having previously spread falsehoods about Harris’s prosecutorial record. But first he made sure to get a few shots in.  “If [Trump] keeps sliding in the polls the way he is, the only way he can keep Kamala out of the White House is if he buys it and refuses to rent it to her,” Hughley said, referencing Trump’s history with discriminatory housing accuations. Hughley also got in a dig about the “Republicans for Kamala” group. “I guess Donald Trump will finally know what it’s like when you get left for a younger woman,” he said. Earlier this week, I wrote about how Democrats made the second night of the DNC feel like “Def Comedy Jam” with all of the biting Trump jokes. In Hughley, Dems platformed an actual star from the hit series. The president is rooting Harris on from 2,000 miles away in California. Harris’ niece Meena Harris took the stage along with the vice president’s stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, and her goddaughter Helena Hudlin. Emhoff (whose dress, by the way, was phenomenal) said that when Harris came into her life at the age of 14, “she was patient, caring and always took me seriously.” Hudlin told the crowd that Harris’ “advice means everything, whether it’s pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn’t feel so hopeful.” It was a major contrast with the character witnesses that Trump brought to the stage last month at the RNC, that’s for sure. Unlike then, none of the speakers tonight are Harris’ employees. In what may be one of the cuter moments ever staged at a political convention, Harris’ great-nieces Amara and Leela Ajagu joined actress Kerry Washington on stage to teach the audience “how to say our auntie’s’ name.” “First you say ‘comma’ like a comma in a sentence,” said Amara.  “Then you say ‘la,’ like la-la-la-la-la,” added Leela. The girls then led the crowd in saying “comma” and “la.” The moment was cute, but there was a serious subtext. Trump and GOP allies such as Rep. Nancy Mace have repeatedly mispronounced Harris’ first name. While possibly understandable a few years ago, this sign of disrespect is pretty obviously intentional today. Country trio The Chicks just took the stage to sing the national anthem. The country music industry has been in the spotlight throughout the week, with performances from Mickey Guyton and Maren Morris, as well. I can’t help but think of The Chicks invitation as a bit of a thumb in Republicans’ eyes. After all, The Chicks are true victims of the “cancel culture” conservative types often complain about. The group faced backlash and was effectively blackballed by many in the country music industry in 2003 after they publicly denounced George Bush for launching the Iraq War. Democrats have been having a hell of a party this week. A big question that one important group watching Harris tonight wants to know is whether they can feel welcome joining the fun. There is a bloc of voters that lean right but can’t get down with Donald Trump, and they will be looking for some assurance that Harris is running to represent all Americans, not just the progressive left. No one is expecting her to promote conservative ideas, but a speech that speaks to the mainstream, projects a strong America on the world stage, and promises basic competence in governance could go a long way to broaden her coalition. Newly minted Olympic gold medalist Steph Curry just made an appearance to endorse Harris via video. Curry said his experience winning gold with the USA men’s basketball team in France helped inspire him to back Harris.  “That unity on and off the court reminded us all that together we can do all things and continue to inspire the world,"" Curry said. ""That’s why I believe that Kamala as president could bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward. This is about preserving hope and belief in our country, and making sure families can be taken care of during their most precious times.” Curry’s coach Steve Kerr endorsed Harris on the first night of the DNC and performed Curry’s “night night” three-point celebration to mock Trump. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: It’s important to remember to step back. A month ago, Harris was writing an entirely different speech. Normally, you work on these speeches for months. You have polling, you have focus groups, and you have meetings with senior advisors. This is a shorter runway. This is also about tomorrow. It’s not just about tonight. What she needs to do is not a policy speech but an inspiring speech — a vision. Tonight, she needs to ask people to go out there and get active. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. We just finished a stretch of speakers focused on climate change and Democrats’ efforts to mitigate its effects. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland struck out at Trump’s claim that climate change is a hoax and how he “made it easier for big companies to poison our air and water.” Content creator John Russell took the stage after a video he produced highlighted Trump’s faux support for labor and the clean energy jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act. And Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., the first Gen Z member of Congress, reminded the crowd that “the climate crisis isn’t some far-off threat — it is here.” What a difference this is from DNCs past. “Climate was not a campaign issue eight or 12 years ago,” Manish Bapna, president of the NRDC Action Fund, told NPR ahead of the convention. “It was extremely difficult to get climate into one of the major debates, it was seen as a peripheral and not a central issue.” Fast-forward to today, and it’s a crucial part of the case that Democrats are making for Harris. Frost, who was an organizer before being elected as the first Gen Z member of Congress, delivered a short, punchy speech focused on the chief concern among younger generations. “Fighting the climate crisis is patriotic. And unlike Donald Trump, our patriotism is more than some slogan on a hat. It’s about actually giving a damn about the people who live in this country,” Frost said. “Because when you love someone, you want them to have clean air. When you love someone, you want them to have safe drinking water. And when you love someone, you want them to have a dignified job.” There’s been a parade of prosecutors, current and former, onstage tonight to speak to Harris’ background. That includes Amy Resner, who worked alongside Harris in California early in her career, and Tristan Snell, who prosecuted the case against Trump University. “I can’t wait to see her prosecute the case against Donald Trump on the debate stage in September,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a fellow former state attorney general, told the crowd. “We face a stark choice in this election, a felon and con man, or a dedicated prosecutor.” The moment highlighting Harris’s prosecutorial accomplishments featured Nathan Horns, a student victimized by Corinthian Schools’ predatory lending practices and false assurances to students. As attorney general, Harris filed a lawsuit that ultimately helped secure billions of dollars in student loan forgiveness for students who borrowed to attend Corinthian. Naturally, this provided an opening to discuss Trump’s infamous, multimillion-dollar settlement with defrauded students enrolled in the now-defunct Trump University.  Tristan Snell, a lawyer who prosecuted Trump University before the settlement, said, “Donald Trump ripped off his biggest fans and made $5 million in profit.” He adds, “Kamala Harris fought scammers like him” and will fight for the people as president. Trump’s rally in Arizona tomorrow will include a special guest, his campaign says. The rally will take place just hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running in the presidential race as an independent candidate, holds a news conference in Phoenix (a 30-minute drive from Glendale), during which he is reportedly expected to announce an end to his presidential bid and endorse Trump. New York City Councilman Yusuf Salaam, one of the exonerated “Central Park Five,” said it plainly: “He wanted us dead.”  The brutal rape and attempted murder of a female jogger in Central Park in the spring of 1989 represented the apotheosis of fears over crime in 1980s New York City. But before due process could run its course, a Manhattan real estate developer named Donald Trump infamously paid for a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of the teenagers accused of the crime. The teens were convicted and served prison time, but they were exonerated. They didn’t do it. And Trump has never acknowledged his error. In fact, he’s expressed support for extrajudicial killings in other countries as a crime-preventive measure.  Watching Salaam and his fellow exonerees speak to the nation three-and-a-half decades removed from their wrongful arrests and convictions is a striking moment — and also a prescient warning of what Trump would do on his retribution tour if we were to win another term. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Daily today, Walz's speech delivered a ""communal patriotism"" that was in ""striking contrast"" to Donald Trump. But it the vice presidential nominee's personal story about his family infertility struggles — and his children's reaction to it — that stole the show. ""You are my entire world and I love you,"" Walz said to his daughter, Hope, and his son, Gus. Hope made a heart symbol with her hands as her brother stood up beside her, teared up and shouted, ""That's my dad!"" The Rev. Al Sharpton leaned into his background at the pulpit with his speech, riffing hard on Harris’ unofficial campaign slogan “We won’t go back” to get the crowd on their feet. And he brought it home hard while paraphrasing the Bible: Rachel Maddow speaking on MSNBC moments ago: As Kamala Harris gets ready to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president of the United States, it has been 152 years since Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to ever run for president in this country — long before women even had the right to vote. It has been 52 years since Shirley Chisholm became the first Black candidate for president. It has been eight years since Hillary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.  Tonight, Kamala Harris will accept the nomination of her party as the culminating event of what has been a supercharged, energetic, profoundly enthusiastic convention. Television ratings, to the extent that they matter in the world, so far show the Democrats have pretty widely outpaced the Republican convention in terms of how many Americans have been watching this thing each night thus far. But it’s really only the beginning. Tonight’s finale from the Democratic Convention in Chicago will start a 75-day sprint to election night. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Taking back the idea of “patriotism” from Republicans has been a major theme this week, and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., was a great choice to continue that trend. Slotkin, who is running for the U.S. Senate, denounced Trump’s desire to withdraw from the world, and she told listeners to “proudly claim your patriotism. You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag but spit in the face of freedom. It represents you.” Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I can just tell you that when Senator Warren was announced and started to walk on that stage, this entire arena erupted. That sustained applause was on a similar level to the way that Tim Walz was received. It was on a similar level to the way Bill Clinton was received. It was loud, it was sustained and you could see her get emotional.  I think it’s poignant because it really speaks to where the Democratic Party has moved. This is a party that is unashamed of being progressive and unashamed of its progressive values.  Warren used to be a Republican back in the day. She then shifted and became a Democrat. She's sort of defined and maligned on the right as some socialist but she’s not. She’s just an academic who became a politician to try to stop rich people and corporations from cheating people. That’s a basic value. It's now a mainstream Democratic Party progressive value. I think that’s why she’s feeling that love. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Near the end of her speech, Sen. Elizabeth Warren cracked that she wouldn’t trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to move her couch. Get it? Of course you do. The ubiquitous joke built on an obviously fake premise drove Republicans batty for weeks. It was effective at highlighting their hypocrisy of abiding by nine years of defamatory falsehoods by Trump.  But it’s over. The joke is beat. Remember when the first ""Borat"" movie came out and it was the funniest thing in years and everyone was doing Sacha Baron Cohen’s ridiculous accent? Remember how annoying it was six months later?  That’s where the couch joke is now. And if Warren’s crack wasn’t contrived enough, the next speaker, Rep. Jason Crow, took another jab with a reference to a “couch commando.” Dems, it’s over. There’s comedy to be mined out there. Find another joke. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey echoed Harris’ attacks on price gouging, arguing that Americans are being “ripped off” by big corporations. He started by citing the price of diapers, which has skyrocketed recently. This increase isn’t due to inflation, Casey argued. “The corporations say your prices are up only because their costs are up,” he said. “They’re selling you a lie.” As with Harris, Casey said that while most companies are playing by the rules, diaper prices were up because of “food conglomerates” who are “extorting” consumers, comparing them to people who hoarded toilet paper during the pandemic. The Biden administration has struggled to find a response to inflation, but Harris took a new line on the issue earlier this month when she began talking about targeting price-gouging. Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado took the baton from ""SNL"" cast member Kenan Thompson to lead tonight’s Project 2025 takedown. As I mentioned earlier, quick, plain-spoken and easily digestible segments like these speak to Democrats’ focus on social media-friendly content at this year’s convention — content that can be shared long after the DNC ends. A standing ovation for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as she takes the podium. The crowd cheered for so long that the senator began to tear up, and tried to get the crowd to settle down. It’s worth remembering how popular she was among the base during her own run for president in 2020. Warren’s speech was heavy on boosting Harris’ support over how she has taken on corporations and big banks in favor of the little guy in America. It was the core of Warren’s own message when running for president in 2020, one that has since then become a centerpiece of Democratic messaging writ large. These days it’s hard to imagine a Democrat who would stand in front of a crowd this big and try to defend price gouging from corporations or billionaires who don’t pay their fair share in taxes. Harris will officially accept the Democratic nomination tonight, but she also celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary with second gentleman Doug Emhoff today. They both posted tributes to each other on social media, with Harris calling Emhoff “the best partner I could ask for.” The convention voted earlier this week to approve the official Democratic platform. Funnily enough, the text itself was approved by the committee that drafted it before Biden dropped out, leaving references to his re-election scattered throughout. Harris’ name is mentioned only as a part of the Biden-Harris administration and when talking about some of the initiatives she has spearheaded as vice president. As such, it stands to reason that there may be parts of the platform that she doesn’t fully agree with. For example, we don’t know if she is OK that this year’s plank deleted any reference to abolishing the death penalty. We also don’t know whether any of her own policy proposals might contradict those within the platform. It’s not binding on anyone running — but it would be nice to get some clarity about what she might do that would be different from a second Biden term. I, for one, would not have guessed ahead of this week that the DNC would have its own in-house hypeman: DJ Metro, on the ones and twos. He’s been pumping out jams since the convention gaveled in tonight and the people in the audience are loving it. So do the camera operators who have been loving snagging footage of the attendees dancing. I’m not trying to harsh anyone’s buzz, but I can’t help but think it’s going to be very funny to look back on these moments 30 years from now. As evidence, I submit to you this video from the 1996 DNC of attendees dancing to “The Macarena” without any further comment: After Republicans invited folks like Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock to give their convention a celebrity presence, Democrats raised the bar with a convention featuring celebs like Oprah, John Legend and Mindy Kaling. But some of the star power has had more of an impact behind the scenes. The biopic that is set to play before Harris’ speech tonight was directed by Reginald Hudlin, the famed director and producer behind classic films like “Boomerang” and “House Party.” Some more recent Hudlin films that have garnered critical acclaim include “Marshall,” which starred Chadwick Boseman, and “The Black Godfather,” a star-studded Netflix documentary about music executive Clarence Avant. Hudlin met Harris years ago through his wife, Chrisette, and the Hudlins’ son Alexander is the VP’s godson. Alexander spoke alongside Harris’ niece and nephew at the DNC last night. Jacob Soboroff speaking on MSNBC moments ago: The RNC kicked off in the wake of the horrific assassination attempt of Trump. And there was a lot of conversation about how it was going to feature a unifying message — which turned out to be anything but. Instead there was a deeply divisive message, obviously. And remember what was happening on those convention signs? They said “mass deportation now.” It was literally a message of kicking millions of people out of the country, many of whom, especially from a place like California, are our neighbors, are our colleagues, and people we know very well. Obviously that’s not the tone or the tenor of the DNC at all. And it’s so easy to feel the difference standing down on the floor. Those folks at the Republican convention, they were enthusiastic, and they were happy to be there. But this is an entirely different thing.  These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Affordable housing is deeply lacking across the country, a crisis that the federal government has only just begun to address. It makes sense then that several of the early speakers tonight have chosen to focus on it. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge told the audience that Harris “knows housing is a human right and a pathway to the middle class.” Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., told the audience about her work as California attorney general to deal with predatory loans during the Great Recession and her dedication to affordable housing. Accordingly, one of the first policy proposals that Harris has put forward since ascending to the top of the ticket is to provide $25,000 in aid to first-time homebuyers for a down payment. Interestingly enough, neither Fudge nor Lieu directly mentioned Harris’ proposal in their speeches. Sen. Alex Padilla, who succeeded Harris as a U.S. senator from California when she became vice president, noted in his brief remarks that she’s good with his kids. “Whenever she sees Roman, Alejandro and Diego, she greets them with kindness and respect,” he said. “Literally meeting them on their level to speak to them and to listen.” Padilla’s remarks serve as a major contrast with Trump, who once flubbed a simple Christmas Eve call with a 7-year-old. Rep. Ted Lieu of California kicked off his speech with a jab at Trump for his ridiculous claim that the Harris campaign was using artificial intelligence to fabricate crowds in photos.  “As a computer science major, I am so impressed with how large this AI-generated crowd looks tonight,"" Lieu said. Lieu has never missed an opportunity to make a mockery of Trump. Michael Steele speaking on MSNBC moments ago: There are three pieces that will go into Harris’ speech tonight: the bio, the acknowledgment of the work she’s done with Joe Biden and then, of course, where she wants to go. What does President Harris look like and sound like? We should hopefully get a first taste of that this evening. There are a bunch of gnarly issues out there that are waiting for her that will have to be addressed almost immediately upon taking the oath of office. I think the American people would like to get some sense of what that feels like and looks like for them. It’s not just the economy, it’s global affairs, it’s reproductive health, it’s educating their children or it’s starting their small business.      I remember well from when I was in school that teachers are adept at tagging-teaming. So it was with Rebecca Pringle, head of the National Education Association, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Walz’s background as a former public school teacher has been featured heavily this week, so it seems fitting that Pringle leaned into it in her speech. She also took on the job of being the cheerleader for Coach Walz and Harris, while Weingarten hit harder at Trump and Vance in her speech Democrats have a well-deserved reputation for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. And yet they have been almost aggressively “in array” for the past month. There’s no secret sauce to reveal. A historically unpopular incumbent president — already facing slim odds at re-election — gave a debate performance so catastrophic it will make historians forget about Richard Nixon’s flop-sweat in 1960 and George H.W. Bush impatiently looking at his watch in 1992. But Joe Biden then dropped out of the race. His replacement, Kamala Harris, benefits from a surge of non-negativity left in the wake of his exit. After his retirement party on opening night, Biden has been an afterthought at this convention. But try to imagine tonight as the capper of a weeklong hype party to re-elect Biden. To get there, Biden would have withstood a seven-week-long rebellion by the leadership of his party, top donors and activist groups. He’d have to continue to insist the polls were wrong, that Donald Trump and the right’s relentless attacks on his cognitive decline weren’t leaving a mark on his approval ratings, and that his choice to stay in the race was actually a selfless act and destined to succeed. He’d have had to make the case to the American people that he’s the present and the future of the party. It’s hard to imagine Nancy Pelosi in the crowd chanting “We love Joe!” in that scenario, although she’d probably still have dutifully shown up. But that’s another universe entirely. Harris has been a top voice in the Biden administration in condemning the rising death toll in Gaza and the deep suffering of Palestinian civilians in the enclave. Since she launched her presidential bid in July, her campaign has also held meetings with the Uncommitted movement, which aims to push the party on a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. But whether or not she would make a significant policy shift on the issue if she’s elected is a big unknown. In her speech tonight, Harris may denounce the killings of civilians in Gaza — as she has in the past — which is an arguably safe position to take, politically speaking. But the vice president, who still has not released detailed policy plans so far and has been described as risk-averse, is unlikely to even subtly criticize Israel’s military conduct in Gaza. Never one to cede the spotlight, Trump attempted a little counterprogramming by visiting the U.S.-Mexico border today. Standing at a podium in Cochise County, Arizona, the former president read short but graphic descriptions of sexual assaults, robberies and murders committed by immigrants. “With your vote, we will seal the border, stop the invasion and launch the largest deportation effort in American history,” he said. The campaign stop was meant to highlight the issue of immigration, but Trump’s grim and graphic remarks also provided a stark contrast with the optimistic tone of the Democratic National Convention all week. On Friday, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, will hold a rally in Glendale outside Phoenix. Ari Melber, speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I’m reminded of the song Public Service Announcement by Jay-Z where he says, “Allow me to reintroduce myself.” That’s something that people do even when they’re well known. Tonight is Vice President Kamala Harris’ reintroduction on the grand stage. In that song, Jay-Z says, “My homie Strict told me, ‘Dude finish your breakfast’...Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this. Shoot at you actors like movie directors.” That’s not only a double entendre, he’s calling out his opponents, his foes as actors, as inauthentic, while he’s the real deal.  I’m looking for Harris to build on what Gov. Tim Walz did last night. She’s at the top of the ticket. I’m expecting her to speak on these actors, these phonies, these fakes. That’s not just Donald Trump but the part of the MAGA movement that has tried to steal and fake what they represent — “real America” or family values or football or freedom.  All three days have been leading up to this moment. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Following in the grand tradition of the Oscars and other televised events, this year’s DNC has consistently run behind schedule. But that may be a calculated risk.  While it’s true that running late pushes some of the big speeches out of prime time, that isn’t really the disaster that it might have been a few years ago. Most viewers who willingly tune into four nights of convention programming are probably already on board with the Harris campaign. With so many streaming platforms, cable TV channels, and video games out there to fill your night, less plugged-in voters are not forced to watch conventions anymore. But they’ll still run across them, when they turn to social media, where the highlight reels of the big speeches will be playing on repeat in the coming days. Democratic leaders have refused to grant a speaking slot to a Palestinian American on the main stage, the Uncommitted movement said Wednesday. Members of the movement, which hopes to pressure Harris on an arms embargo to Israel and on a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, have been holding a sit-in outside the United Center since Wednesday evening. The group’s leader, Abbas Alawieh, has said that Harris’ campaign made an offer of a private meeting instead, which the group rejected. Now, party leaders are now facing increasing pressure from uncommitted delegates, Democratic lawmakers and outside groups, such as United Auto Workers and the Sunrise Movement, to allow a Palestinian American to address the convention on its final night. Earlier today, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in an interview with Zeteo: “If we are to say that we’re a party that is inclusive, that unity is our strength, we have to make room. There’s still time.”   As Harris takes the stage for the biggest speech of her political career, she may be leaning on some old lessons for public speaking. As a senator in 2019, she shared some of that advice with a young woman. The moment, which was caught on tape, was then posted on Harris’ social media channels. “I never miss a chance to speak with our future leaders, especially young women,” Harris wrote on Facebook. “One recently asked me how to become a better public speaker. My answer: ‘Remember, people need to know what you know!’” In the video, Harris tells the girl to imagine that she’s the only person on the Titanic who knows that the ship is going to sink and needs to tell everyone. “If you are on the Titanic and you know the ship is about to sink, and you’re the only one who knows, are you going to worry about how you look and how you sound? No, because the thing that’s most important is that everyone knows what you know.” The Harris campaign has received a lot of praise for its social media strategy. I’ve been following along with this week’s DNC programming with that in mind, while picking out portions of the convention that have seem tailor-made for social media. When the campaign announced that it would offer an online stream of the event that could play in vertical format, as well as invite popular influencers to attend in person, it showed they were prioritizing viewers who might be watching the convention online and accustomed to getting their information there. And this week, various segments in-between speakers have been produced in a style or written in the same punchy tone as political content you’ve likely seen go viral. That includes the “two lies and a lie” segment that aired on Monday, the Vox-style explainer video narrated by Harris about Trump’s tariffs plan that aired Tuesday, and the brief Project 2025 interludes we’ve seen throughout the week — in particular, the one starring “SNL” cast member Kenan Thompson. It has all felt like Democratic Party officials recognize that the Harris campaign has developed a lot of momentum on social media — and want to keep feeding the audience they’ve established there with familiar content. Democrats, thrilled by Harris’ “joyful” campaign, have really leaned into “politics as entertainment” at the convention this week. In between warnings about the dire stakes in this election, they’ve had huge musical acts (with Pink and The Chicks scheduled to perform later, and a big mystery guest who some pundits have speculated is Beyoncé), DJ-led dance breaks and Hollywood celebrities as keynote speakers. Most attendees certainly seem to be enjoying themselves, but whether you perceive it as unbridled enthusiasm for Harris or as a garish political spectacle may depend on how you feel about American politics in general. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: There are two colors you see a lot in the audience. One is blue, unsurprisingly, but overwhelmingly, the color is white. And the symbolism is not lost on me and it’s not lost on a lot of people. This is a moment women in this country have been waiting a long time for, which is the elevation of a woman to the top of the Democratic Party and I would say there’s even more than maybe there was in 2016 or renewed optimism in the wake of Donald Trump years and the defeat that Hillary Clinton suffered. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. The DNC just released some additional speakers for tonight.  As someone who lived through the Clinton and Obama years, this DNC feels like a major shift has occurred. Gone is the almost apologetic tone that Democrats adopted in the aftermath of blowout losses in 1980, when “Reagan Democrats” voted for the Republican nominee, and the “shellacking” of the 2010 midterms. Instead, what we’ve seen in speech after speech is a party that knows what it stands for and what it stands against. Within the past 15 years, the Democrats have gone from a party with a sizable conservative wing (either fiscally like the Blue Dogs, socially on abortion and gay rights, or both) to one that loudly champions workers over corporate greed, protections for LGBTQ Americans, and abortion rights for all. There’s still a lot of room for improvement on a number of issues, but the difference between then and now shouldn’t be taken for granted. Social media and media pundits are abuzz with speculation about whether music icons Beyoncé and Taylor Swift — arguably THE biggest names in music right now — will appear tonight at the DNC to support Harris. Pop singer Pink and country trio The Chicks (formerly known as the Dixie Chicks) are already slated to perform tonight. But fans can't help but wonder if Queen Bey and T-Swift will also show up. With Beyoncé's permission, Harris is using her song ""Freedom"" as her campaign anthem. It's been featured heavily during the convention, on the campaign trail, and in a new campaign ad. Some speculated that White House political director Emmy Ruiz's tweet this afternoon hinted at a Beyoncé performance (she tweeted a bee emoji, a possible reference to ""Bey."" She also tweeted after that ""my 6 year old took my phone."" Hmm. To this Taylor Swift fan, it seems improbable that she would make an appearance tonight for a couple of reasons: 1.) When she endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, it wasn't until a few weeks before the election, and 2.) In an Instagram post yesterday, she said the foiled terror plot that canceled Eras Tour shows in Vienna filled her with ""a new sense of fear."" It wouldn't seem surprising if she wanted to avoid making any political statements in light of that. But hey, we'll just have to wait and see. It’s kind of weird: Listen to just about any high-profile Democrat talk about Trump and the GOP presidential ticket these days, and odds are it won’t be long before you hear the word “weird.” As Ja’han Jones recently noted for The ReidOut Blog, “weird” might be far too mild for the likes of Trump, but there’s little doubt that the descriptor has rattled him — the former president insisted at a campaign event Monday that he and his running mate, JD Vance, are “extremely normal people.”  Ja’han also explained that the rhetorical strategy has etymological roots in California slang: “In Harris’ home state of California, for example, “weird” — for many young nonwhite people — doesn’t just mean quirky or unique, it’s used as an insult. That’s why there’s a genre of TikToks featuring young Californians talking about how being called “weird” — or its variant, “a weirdo” — is an offense that basically amounts to fighting words.” Read Ja’han’s full piece below. Check out these highlight reels from the first three nights of the convention to get caught up. In many ways, Harris’ speech tonight will be more like a campaign launch than a typical acceptance speech. Because of the truncated way in which she kicked off her run this year, the vice president did not have a big kickoff rally to introduce her big themes and set the stage for the campaign. Instead, she visited the already-running Biden campaign headquarters and then jumped into routine campaigning, with one big policy speech on economics.  That makes tonight the moment for Harris to lay out her vision for the presidency, make the case for her policy agenda, which remains a work in progress, and tell her personal story. It probably won’t be too different from the kickoff speech she had for her ill-fated 2020 run for the Democratic presidential nomination, in which she talked about how her parents met and how she viewed the role of prosecutor as helping fight for fairness. Harris, of course, is the keynote speaker tonight. Don't expect her to address the convention before 11 p.m. ET. Here's who is expected to speak before Harris tonight (in no particular order):"
DNC viewers just got Bey-fished,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 8:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-dnc-rumor-kamala-harris-rcna167895,"Despite the rumors, there was not a special appearance from Mrs. Beyoncé Knowles-Carter on Thursday, the fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention. Dozens of attendees who wore “Cowboy Kamala” fits tonight for nothing are likely devastated at the lack of a performance from the superstar. This despite TMZ promising us that she would be performing, as did several dozen random people on social media who insisted that she was there in Chicago. “Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there,"" a representative for Beyoncé told NBC News on Thursday as the DNC headed into final hours. “The report of a performance is untrue.” Look, I don’t know who started this rumor. Maybe it was a bored convention staffer whose deadpan is a little too dry to have their sarcasm register. Maybe it was James Taylor in revenge for having his number cut on Night 1 of the DNC. Maybe it was some evil genius on the Harris team who figured out a way to get people to tune in who might not otherwise watch and stay until the balloons have dropped.  In the end, we are all the more deceived for Thursday's ruse. But, if you really think about it, what is a recording of Beyonce’s “Freedom,” the campaign’s anthem that played at the close of Harris’ speech, if not a “performance?”"

Yes, that is not a typo. But Pink’s longevity is only one part of her impressive legacy. More than the tens of millions of albums sold and world tours completed, it’s Pink’s pioneering brand of popp-y, punk-y empowerment that has always made her stand out. Years before it was common, or cool, Pink was penning anthems that reassured young women and girls everywhere that they mattered; that they were enough.  She pushed back, hard, on unrealistic beauty standards, George W. Bush and misogyny. She refused to apologize for her sexuality, her politics, her hair or her attitude. She spawned a generation of fans — myself included — who revered her authenticity, her passion and her talent. And that’s to say nothing of her live performances. Find me another pop star in her 30s who performs a Cirque du Soleil show while belting. I’ll wait. Tonight, on the star-studded final night of the Democratic National Convention, she performed her rallying cry single “What About Us” with her daughter Willow Sage. And it was pretty “f----- perfect.”"

Why it matters that Kamala Harris has two white guys in her corner,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 1:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-white-guys-doug-emhoff-tim-walz-rcna166670,"“Historic,” the word most often used to describe Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential candidacy, is just shorthand for the fact that in nearly 250 years of this country’s existence, no one who looks like her has ever been at the top of a major party’s ticket.  That’s got nothing to do with ability. Racism and sexism are rigorous gatekeepers of America’s halls of power. Consequently, the mere presence of a biracial Black American woman of Indian descent in the race at this stage is a challenge to the status quo. But Harris’ run is also historic in another, less discussed way.  Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. On the campaign trail, Doug Emhoff and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Harris’ husband and vice presidential running mate, respectively — embody figures rarely before observed in American life: white men who know their place. That is to say, white men who know their supportive place and seem to occupy it without hesitation or resentment. This is the first time our national political stage has hosted two white men whose role is to passionately champion a Black woman all the way to the White House.  Obviously, it’s vitally important not to diminish Harris as the main character in this political story. But it’s still worth examining the optics presented by Walz and Emhoff, because those two white guys are defying and potentially redefining America’s vision of authority and leadership. Amid all the racist, sexist MAGA detritus that surrounds us, the Harris campaign is a necessary glimpse at what American power, equality and truly inclusive democracy could someday look like. That redefinition would be notable in any moment, but it’s particularly important in the dark timeline we find ourselves on. Former President Donald Trump’s frequent attacks on Black women journalists and insults toward Black women lawmakers have energized masses of racist misogynists. The corrosive spillage of MAGA identity politics — in addition to innumerable anti-woman and anti-anti-racist laws, policy proposals and civil rights rollbacks — has included the absurd notion that white masculinity is in crisis. Walz seems to have understood the assignment from the jump. During vetting interviews, Walz reportedly volunteered that he wasn’t “angling for anything else” and emphasized, “This is not about me.” Both quotes suggest Walz not only understood the level of deference and loyalty required, but also took pains to establish that he would have no issues offering both to a Black woman superior.  “Being strategically invisible or staying in the background will require a humility that many white men have never had to demonstrate,” Sheletta Brundidge, a Minnesota-based Black woman author, wrote in a Minnesota Star Tribune op-ed. “She’s going to be Gladys Knight; he will be a Pip.”  Since his selection, Walz has seemed joyful as second-in-command, radiating an ease in the role that most likely assuages the reflexive discomfort some voters — and particularly white voters — would feel seeing the boss is a Black woman.  The misogynist smears that might allow MAGA types to portray Walz as a “beta” for playing second banana to a Black woman are simply less effective because of his background as a football coach, hunter, gun owner and National Guard veteran. Misogynoir falsely pathologizes Black women as inherently anormal — but as an older, rural-coded Midwestern white man, Walz is regarded as almost aggressively normal — or as the headlines put it, “all-American” and an “everyman.”  The tendency to view Black women with suspicion and hostility — to interpret the mildest pleas for equitable change as inherently dangerous and threatening — remains. But the Harris campaign might succeed in moving the needle a bit on those perceptions.  The same reassurances are provided by Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman- turned-Harris campaign surrogate, whose demonstrations of supportive partnership earned his reputation as a “wife guy” as far back as 2019. Emhoff’s loving advocacy of his wife’s ascendance consistently suggests he feels he “married up” — a sentiment rarely extended to Black women in a system in which even their femininity is routinely questioned. (Right-wing memes questioning both Michelle Obama’s and Harris’ gender are par for the MAGA course.)  Emhoff ditched his career as a firm’s partner attorney to attend to his wife’s, breaking with all gender expectations, especially those attached to white men who have succeeded in corporate America. In positioning himself as the white man happily standing behind a great Black woman, Emhoff exemplifies a breed of white male masculinity in opposition to MAGA’s camp, women-hating, masculinity — one that emphasizes partnership and respect over insecure dominance and superiority. “I’m honored now to have my wife be at the top of the ticket,” Emhoff recently announced on a podcast. “I cannot tell you how proud I am of her.”  Emhoff’s words are a rejection of the idea that Black women’s goals should somehow be contained, that Black women are taking up too much space or vying for spots that somehow always rightfully belong to someone else. And it’s the opposite of the right’s fragile white masculinity model, which views gender equality as oppressive and racial justice as unbearable.  Several decades back, these folks would probably have called Emhoff and Walz “N-word lovers” and kept it moving, but now they use more euphemistic terms. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed Walz is “afraid of testosterone.” Rob Schmitt, a Newsmax anchor, described Walz as “the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people” — a gender and racial turncoat, if you will. Donald Trump Jr., the creative one in the family, predictably labeled the White Dudes for Harris fundraising call “Cucks for Kamala.” And Christopher Rufo, the right-wing architect of the phony “critical race theory” panic, was so apoplectic over the announcement of Walz’s appointment that he spent the whole day firing off social media copes. None of this is to suggest Walz and Emhoff should be lauded as American superheroes. White men are praised enough for doing the absolute barest of minimums on behalf of decency, and “white saviorism” is among our country’s most tired tropes. But the two are working against deeply ingrained, stubbornly persistent and highly damaging ideas about whiteness and maleness, modeling behavior that really shouldn’t be so expectation-defying at this point — and yet.  “How often in 100 days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in 100 days do you get to do something that’s going to impact generations to come?” Walz asked attendees on the White Dudes for Harris call. “And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his ass, sent him on the road?” It’s yet another idea that Harris herself couldn’t push too strongly, lest she set off alarm bells, handing MAGA something to scare white voters over. But the point stands, nonetheless."
The problem(s) with conspiracy theories about revised job data,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-conspiracy-theories-revised-job-data-rcna167837,"When it comes to the U.S. job market, there’s been some tension over the last year or so between the data and the expectations. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to deliberately cool the economy and lower inflation, which was expected to simultaneously reduce hiring. On the other hand, monthly job totals continued to look great. It was against this backdrop that Labor Department delivered some discouraging-but-unsurprising news. NBC News reported: In a statement, White House Chief Economic Adviser Jared Bernstein said the preliminary estimate “doesn’t change the fact that the jobs recovery has been and remains historically strong, delivering solid job and wage gains, strong consumer spending, and record small business creation.” This reaction has the benefit of being accurate. The downward revisions were obviously not good news, but (a) some economists projected an even harsher revision; and (b) by any fair measure, the post-pandemic job growth hasn’t just been impressive, it’s also exceeded even the most optimistic expectations from 2021. Republicans, evidently, don’t quite see it that way. House Speaker Mike Johnson, for example, who’s spent his tenure pretending not to notice American job growth, responded to the Labor Department’s report by saying that “Kamalanomics” — whatever the heck that means — is “crushing our economy.” This is an impossible argument to take seriously, given that the economy remains healthy. Indeed, the idea that the vice president’s economic vision is “crushing” the economy is belied by reality — our economy remains the envy of the world — as the Louisiana congressman really ought to know. But Johnson’s reaction was practically sensible compared to Donald Trump’s. “There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent,” Trump said in a speech this week. The former president added a day later that the White House was caught “manipulating job statistics,” adding, “They wanted it to come out after the election, but somehow it got leaked.” So, a few things. First, the idea that the original job numbers have been proven “fraudulent” is bonkers. These revisions are a standard part of the process: Officials went with the best information available, and that information has now been updated to be more accurate, which is exactly what's happened during every modern administration. Second, no one has been caught “manipulating” anything. Indeed, in 2019 — the third year of the Trump presidency — the Labor Department had a similar report that revised job totals down by roughly 500,000. By Trump’s reasoning, that means his own administration was responsible promoting “fraudulent” job numbers that had been “manipulated” by the Republican White House. Third, I don’t know who “they” are, but the idea that “they” wanted this information to come out after the election “but somehow it got leaked” is simply bananas. In fact, William Beach explained in an online statement, “For those who think the big revision to the BLS jobs numbers ‘leaked’ and was meant to come out after the election, remember that BLS always announces its draft revisions in August and announced this year’s date, August 21, many months ago. It is important to check your facts.” And who’s William Beach? He’s the man Trump appointed to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Voters concerned about the American job market should probably take note: Trump, even now, doesn’t understand the basics of job data."
Supreme Court partially grants GOP bid to enforce Arizona proof-of-citizenship voting law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 12:16 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-republican-rnc-arizona-voting-law-rcna167243,"A divided Supreme Court partially granted an emergency request from the Republican National Committee to enforce an Arizona law that requires documentary proof of citizenship to vote, specifically letting the state require such proof when registering to vote using a state form. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have fully granted the Republican application. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have fully denied it. The GOP went to the high court after a federal appeals court panel approved a district court injunction against the law. The emergency application, from the RNC and the Arizona state Senate president and House speaker, sought to pause (or “stay”) the injunction immediately, to the extent that it makes the state (1) accept voter registration applications via a state form without documentary proof of citizenship and (2) allow voters who have not provided documentary proof of citizenship to cast ballots for president or to vote by mail.  The Supreme Court’s order on Thursday rejected the Republican request when it comes to voting for president or voting by mail. Opposing the Republicans’ bid, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes told the justices that “a stay this close to an election will create chaos and confusion, and in turn undermine the credibility of our elections.” The federal government also opposed the stay, noting that “judicial intervention at this stage would undermine the orderly administration of the election, risking the disfranchisement of thousands of voters who have already registered to vote using the federal form.” The “federal form” refers to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states to “accept and use” a standard federal form to register voters for federal elections. That form requires voters to attest under penalty of perjury that they’re U.S. citizens but doesn’t make them to submit documentary proof. Yet the 2022 Arizona law at issue requires federal form users to submit documentary proof to vote for president or by mail, and makes voters submit such proof when they register using an alternative state form.

Kamala Harris needs to start talking about policing — for Sonya Massey’s sake,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-policy-police-sonya-massey-dnc-rcna166753,"Much of the focus at the Democratic National Convention this week will be on how Vice President Kamala Harris, who will accept her party’s presidential nomination, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, address policy issues. The momentum Harris has generated since she reached the top of the ticket has been sensational but largely based on rhetoric that has provided a jolt of hopefulness to voters seeking an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. While Harris seems to understand the priorities of voters and has released her economic plan, one major policy area that she cannot afford to overlook is the future of civil rights. Last month, after an Illinois sheriff’s deputy shot and killed Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black mother of two who had called police for help, Harris reached out to Massey’s family to offer her condolences. The vice president’s public comments echoed the widespread and noncontroversial sentiment that Massey deserved to be safe. Still, at no point did Harris couple her statements about Massey’s being killed with any real plans to address future police violence in America. It is unclear whether, in this pivotal moment, 10 years after a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, Harris and the Democratic Party are committed not only to protecting existing civil rights but also to expanding them. For those who are concerned with addressing civil rights and police violence, and criminal justice in particular, Harris’ identity as a Black, Asian woman will not be enough. As her campaign begins to roll out more substantive policies around other issues, she must also lay out a concrete agenda around civil rights. Harris’ past as a prosecutor — she was the self-proclaimed “top cop” in California — has generated some skepticism about what policing and criminal justice might look like in a Harris administration. Some of her critics’ concerns are based on a distortion of her record, if not downright misinformation. However, even for the most objective of people, Kamala Harris’ history with regard to criminal justice reform and civil rights can be described as complicated. While she is a Democrat, her policies and practices as a prosecutor would not rank anywhere near the more progressive end compared with those of many of her counterparts across the country. It would not be inaccurate to label her a centrist, at best, who at times acted more as a populist. In communities of color especially, there’s a tenuous understanding of the role prosecutors play in relation to overall public safety and community. I say that as a former prosecutor myself. Though Black people want and deserve to live in safe communities, there are legitimate questions as to what role — if any — law enforcement should and can play in bringing about that safety. We learned during President Barack Obama’s two terms in the Oval Office that a Black president, even when paired with a Black attorney general, does not mean the police will stop abusing and killing Black people. Whether it is a vigilante private citizen, as in the cases of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, or violence stemming directly from police, as in the cases of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Atiana Jefferson and countless others whose ultimately went free, that a Black man was in office did not matter.  So many Black people experienced violence at the hands of law enforcement during Obama’s presidency and Eric Holder’s time as the first Black U.S. attorney general, but they were generally powerless in terms of their ability to hold those offending police officers accountable. The easiest and lowest-hanging fruit for Harris on the issue of police violence is to commit to the abolition of qualified immunity. This is the legal doctrine that shields law enforcement from accountability for wrongdoing. If Harris were to prioritize getting rid of qualified immunity as the bedrock of her civil rights agenda, it would immediately quell much of the apprehension around her candidacy from a civil rights perspective. Likewise, this is the time for her to lean in, not only with her words but also with substantive policy measures, to her experience as a prosecutor in addressing real criminal justice reform, as well as reform around policing. It would also distinguish her from Trump, who has called for “absolute immunity” for police. Civil rights, fundamentally, is about access and the opening of doors. The blowback against DEI is, for example, at its core steeped in anti-Blackness but rooted in a pendulum swing away from civil rights. There are a host of issue areas in which Harris could seek to have influence under the banner of civil rights. A commitment to closing the achievement gap for Black boys is a civil rights issue in that a denial of equal access to quality educational opportunities is a violation of their federally protected civil rights. Likewise, access to the ballot is a civil right, and it is instructive that Harris has been vocal in this vein. Presidents are not lawmakers, but Harris ought to commit to using the insuperable power of the bully pulpit to apply pressure and influence policy. This is why an omission of substantive talking points around civil rights is glaring and unacceptable. While Harris can and should take a broad approach in setting forth an ambitious civil rights policy agenda, it’s imperative that she keep the main thing as the main thing and squarely address the issues of criminal justice reform, abolishing qualified immunity and eliminating police violence in America through substantive policy reform. This week she will be on the biggest stage with the brightest lights and the loudest microphone. For the sake of Sonya Massey and so many others, Harris, with so many watching and listening, must present a plan."

"Falling behind, Trump eyes personal attacks as a life-preserver",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 22, 2024, 10:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-personal-attacks-election-2024-rcna167805,"It’s not exactly a secret that Republican officials are practically begging Donald Trump to steer clear of personal attacks and focus on substantive issues. It’s also plainly true that the former president doesn’t care for the advice. The results have been predictable: The GOP candidate has gone after Vice President Kamala Harris’ intellect, gender, laugh, family, appearance and race and ethnicity, among other things. At a long and meandering press conference last week, Trump went so far as to say he felt “entitled“ to go after his Democratic rival in personal ways. There’s little evidence to suggest these attacks are working. The former president has even complained publicly that he hasn’t quite figured out how to apply a nickname to Harris that’s stuck. But as a New York Times report noted, Republicans waiting for Trump to abandon the personal attacks and run as a serious candidate should probably give up. In remarks that were ostensibly about national security, the former president went after President Joe Biden, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama and Harris in personal ways. In fact, Trump used the opportunity to tell his followers that he believes the Democratic nominee is both “stupid” and a “Marxist or a communist.” Apparently trying to rationalize his strategy, the Republican acknowledged the behind-the-scenes advice he’s received. “They always say, ‘Sir, please stick to policy. Don’t get personal,’” Trump said. “And yet they’re getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?” On cue, the crowd responded, “No.” At the same event, the candidate polled his audience, which agreed with their applause that Trump should “get personal” against his opponents. It was at that point when he joked, “My advisers are fired.” The point, of course, isn’t that Trump is going to fire his campaign team. Rather, the point is that his rhetoric was a big hint about what’s to come. In fact, given the larger context, it’s likely that the former president doesn’t just want to engage in personal attacks — this is, after all, his comfort zone — he also thinks he has to engage in personal attacks. Polling suggests he’s falling behind Harris; the Democratic convention has gone quite well for the party thus far; and the GOP nominee is increasingly looking for an electoral life-preserver. As The New Republic’s Greg Sargent summarized, Trump genuinely seems to think that Harris’ surge in the polls “is somehow the result of him being constrained from going full gutter MAGA on her.” All of which suggests the American electorate should expect to see the Republican take the presidential race in an even uglier direction over the next 10 or so weeks."
