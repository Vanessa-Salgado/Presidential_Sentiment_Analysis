"Friday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.2.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fridays-campaign-8224-rcna164883,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * We don’t yet know whom Vice President Kamala Harris will choose as her running mate, but the vetting process, led in part by former Attorney General Eric Holder, is over: The New York Times reported, “Covington & Burling, the Washington law firm tasked with the vetting, completed the job on Thursday afternoon and turned over its findings to Ms. Harris.” * On a related note, the Democratic National Committee’s virtual nominating process is now underway, which will formally make Harris the party’s 2024 nominee. * Donald Trump boasted by way of his social media platform, “There has never been anything like the MAGA Movement. We raised $139 Million Dollars in July alone.” Soon after, the Harris campaign said it had raised $310 million in July, more than double the Republican’s figure. * A recount in Virginia found that House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good really did narrowly lose his primary race, ending his congressional career, at least for now. The incumbent congressman is the only congressional Republican to lose in a primary in the 2024 cycle. * On a related note, Republican Rep. Andy Ogles, another House Freedom Caucus member, fended off a well-funded primary challenger in Tennessee on Thursday. * NBC News reported that Republican Voters Against Trump is rolling out its biggest ad campaign yet, putting $3.5 million behind video ads and billboards in key swing states. The push includes testimonials from voters who’ve switched from Trump to Harris. * The GOP still sees Sen. Sherrod Brown as a top target this year, but a new poll commissioned by AARP and conducted by the bipartisan team of Impact Research and Fabrizio Ward found the Ohio Democrat leading Republican nominee Bernie Moreno, 46% to 42%. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * While the Democratic presidential ticket has only carried North Carolina once in the last four decades, the Trump campaign is now buying ad time in the state, suggesting Team Trump’s internal polling sees a competitive race in North Carolina."
"Trump was late to NABJ interview because he didn't want to be fact-checked, group's president says",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 8:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-nabj-interview-fact-check-delay-rcna164845,"Donald Trump's appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday got off to such a late start because he did not want to be fact-checked live, NABJ President Ken Lemon told Axios. Trump's interview was delayed by more than an hour, and at the time he blamed audio issues for the holdup. ""The speaker equipment at the NABJ is not working properly. Don’t blame me for being late!"" he posted on Truth Social. The technical issues were apparent during the interview, but Lemon told Axios that they ""were resolved very quickly."" Yet, Trump still refused to go on stage if he was going to be fact-checked, Lemon said. “The bigger problem was his threat not to take the stage when he had agreed to go on,"" Lemon added. ""He did not want to be fact-checked, but we could not let him on the stage without fact-checking."" Lemon's comments square with previous reporting that the interview was delayed because Trump objected to the live fact-check shortly before the event began. Lemon told Axios he was preparing to announce that Trump would not appear because of the fact-checking dispute when the GOP nominee walked on stage. The Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, disputed Lemon's explanation for the delay to Axios, saying that Trump waited ""for close to 40 minutes while audio/technical issues were fixed by NABJ."" ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott attempted to push back on several of Trump's lies onstage, though he repeatedly talked over the interviewers. The interview's late start seemed to set the tone for Trump's antagonistic approach to what my colleague Ja’han Jones described as a “car crash of an event.” Trump — whose campaign has been trying to win over Black voters — repeatedly attacked Scott and ABC News. He lied exhaustively, and he ranted and deflected when asked straightforward questions. He also unveiled a confounding new line of attack on Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning her biracial identity and accusing her of not really being Black."
Prisoner deal undermines one of Trump’s attack lines against Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 8:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prisoner-deal-undermines-one-trumps-attack-lines-harris-rcna164870,"Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, and when the host started to ask how international leaders would respond to a Kamala Harris presidency, the Republican interrupted before she was even done with the question. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be like a play toy.” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” In context, the implicit racism and sexism in the on-air comments seemed obvious. The fact that Trump was an international laughingstock during his White House tenure didn’t help matters, either. But the idea that Harris wouldn’t be taken seriously on the international stage was also discredited by reality soon after Trump made his ugly remarks. The Wall Street Journal reported: The Journal’s report added that Harris had met Scholz previously on several occasions, and as an administration official put it, the vice president had a “good working relationship with him.” That’s “part of the reason why she was able to have a really good, frank conversation with him.” A White House official also confirmed with NBC News that when it came to the difficult international process, Harris “moved the ball forward significantly.” Note, Harris hadn’t met Slovenia’s Golob before this year’s Munich Security Conference, and as the Journal’s report noted, “Their meeting was the highest-level U.S. engagement at the time with the Slovenian government, which was holding two Russian nationals Moscow wanted released. That meeting was also restricted to just Harris, Golob and two aides.” Slovenia soon after agreed to participate in the international deal, which is what happens when foreign officials take U.S. officials seriously."
"Loving her 'Black job,' Simone Biles appears to throw shade at Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 7:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/loving-black-job-simone-biles-appears-throw-shade-trump-rcna164862,"As a rule, American politicians tend to root for American athletes at the Olympics. It’s a rule Donald Trump hasn’t always followed. Exactly three years ago this week, for example, the former president lashed out at the U.S. women’s soccer team after they “only” won Bronze medals. “If our soccer team, headed by a radical group of Leftist Maniacs, wasn’t woke, they would have won the Gold Medal instead of the Bronze,” the Republican declared in a written statement. “Woke means you lose, everything that is woke goes bad, and our soccer team certainly has.” Trump added that he wanted to see “Patriots” replace “the wokesters” in future games, suggesting Americans should root not for their country’s athletes, but rather, for conservatives and against liberals. But as it turns out, sometimes Trump sends barbed messages to Olympians, while other times Olympians send barbed messages to Trump. NBC News reported: “Simone Biles being the GOAT, winning Gold medals and dominating gymnastics is her black job,” Davila wrote. “I love my black job,” Biles responded, adding a black heart emoji. To be sure, the gold medalist did not specifically reference the GOP candidate online, but the ""black job” reference was hardly subtle. Trump is, after all, responsible for pushing the phrase into the political lexicon: The former president first used the line during a debate in late June, and he elaborated on this at a National Association of Black Journalists conference this week. It’s tempting to think Trump’s running mate might want to come to his rescue in this instance, but given his own rhetorical history, I think Sen. JD Vance probably ought to sit this one out. The New York Times reported: “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” Vance said at the time. If the Republicans’ 2024 ticket is smart, Trump and Vance will let Biles’ latest comments go without notice. If recent history is any guide, however, the former president seems likely to start another feud. Watch this space."
"Returning to his roots, Trump promotes Harris’ birth certificate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 7:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-promotes-kamala-harris-birth-certificate-election-2024-rcna164848,"The headline on a Punchbowl News report on Thursday stood out: “It’s 2016 all over again following Trump’s racist attacks on Harris.” A day earlier, a Fox News personality told viewers that there’s “2016 energy” around this year’s presidential race. A NOTUS report had a related message today: ""A woman atop the Democratic ticket. GOP lawmakers dodging the press. Trump. Birtherism. The 2024 election has a bit of everything that made 2016 memorable."" At first blush, the analysis seems compelling. In 2016, Donald Trump faced the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket; he targeted her with ugly and sexist attacks; and eight years later, the Republican is recycling many of the same words and phrases as he prepares to face the second woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket. All the while, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pretending to have no idea what Trump is saying, which is similarly reminiscent of what the political world saw during his 2016 candidacy. But to fully appreciate the scope of the former president’s ridiculous antics, perhaps it’s best to look back even further — not to 2016, but to 2010. Trump has spent much of the week questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial and ethnic identity, suggesting the nation’s first Black vice president might not be Black enough by his standards. But as a New York Times report noted, the Republican nominee went even further yesterday. Yes, the conspiracy theorist who helped pioneer the racist “birther” attacks against Barack Obama — several years before he came down the escalator and took over GOP politics — has decided, more than a decade later, to once again take an interest in another Black candidate’s birth certificate. As Off Message's Brian Beutler argued, this is less like 2016 and more like what voters would've heard ""if Trump had challenged Obama in 2012 as a birtherism dead-ender."" The Washington Post asked Loomer yesterday whether she's the one who brought this line of attack to Trump’s attention. “Probably,” the right-wing personality replied, noting that she’d shared the image with the former president. Common sense suggests Trump, given his ridiculous antics targeting Obama's background, should steer clear of even passing references to birth certificates, but evidently, he can’t seem to help himself."
The Best Defense is a Good Offense,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 6:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-best-defense-good-offense-rcna164849,"There is a lightness and an ease felt by Former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to flip the script on Trump’s most tired tactics. From demurring on setting a debate, to questioning Harris’ racial identity, the vice president’s responses have been pitch-perfect. And as we dip below the 100-day mark, access to reproductive healthcare is on the minds of many-- especially for women in states with near or total abortion bans. President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Alexis McGill Johnson, joins Claire to lay out what the 2024 reproductive map looks like, where state ballot initiatives to codify Roe are happening this fall, and the real threat Trump’s Project 2025 poses to restricting care nationwide.

Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, and welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Thursday afternoon on August 1st. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m here with my co-pilot, Claire McCaskill. Hi, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Hey, it’s so much more fun now. Isn’t it? Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, I just feel like there’s so much lightness in my voice and I know. Claire McCaskill: I mean, true confession, I would dread this moment in the week a few weeks ago, like, oh my God, I’ve got to talk about it and I’m so depressed. And now it’s like, man, spring in my step. We are hitting on all cylinders. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. I know. Claire McCaskill: I haven’t felt this good since, you know, the same time in 2008. Jennifer Palmieri: And it feels, it’s not just, oh, you feel good for the vice president. It’s like, you’re proud of President Biden -- Claire McCaskill: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: -- for making this possible. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: You feel good about the Democrats because our leader had a problem, and he dealt with it in like the most generous, courageous way possible. And it just all feels great, so. Claire McCaskill: Speaking of our leader, let’s give him some props right now for -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- an amazing development that happened today that is 100% Joe Biden. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, it’s that three Americans and one permanent U.S. resident were among those freed from Russian captivity today, and one of the biggest prisoner exchanges since the Cold War. “Wall Street Journal” reporter Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan are among the prisoners released. And it’s, yeah, it’s such great news. We send our best to them and their families, their loved ones. And Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, just briefed at the White House, and he talks about how even as Jake was briefing, President Biden was calling leaders of the countries that were part of the prisoner swap to thank them. And he said, it’s just vintage Biden just leveraging America’s allies in a way that, you know, only he can do and has really been a defining feature of his presidency. And I love even Jake got a little choked up, which he never does. So great. Claire McCaskill: And what is really notable is we learned in the coverage of the release today that an hour before President Biden did the selfless and patriotic thing and declared himself no longer running for president, an hour before that, he was on the phone with Slovenia doing what only the president of the United States can do. And that is leveraging our strong relationship and ties with countries to move the needle when it really matters to America. So all of you folks out there think isolationism is the way forward, that all of you who are buying what J.D. Vance is selling and to some extent even Donald Trump, that somehow America doesn’t need anybody else in the world, but America, pay attention here. We need others in the world for us to be safe and for American citizens to be safe as they travel around the world. So this is a really good moment for President Joe Biden. He’s had a lot lately, but this is certainly among one of the tops he’s had this year. Jennifer Palmieri: And before we get deep into the show today, we want to tell you about MSNBC Premium.

Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, and now on to today’s episode, the countdown is on. Oh, my God, there’s only 96 days left to the election. And the DNC virtual convention begins today with 99 percent of the delegates signing Vice President Kamala Harris’s nomination petition. Claire McCaskill: And as I referenced earlier, Kamala is making politics fun again. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We’re going to talk about the messaging that is emerging from her campaign and contrast it with the dark, ugly underbelly of Trump’s message, which has been made quite plain in the last 24 hours. I mean, I’m like watching that thing yesterday. This is when he appeared in front of the National Association of Black Journalists. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And like every answer he gave, I was like, are you kidding me? Is this guy serious? Does he really think this helps him get votes he doesn’t have now? It was really something. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. I mean, and then he posted some crazy stuff on Truth Social today. Some crazy photo as a little follow up as well. And later in this episode, Claire will spend some time with the head of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, for a deep dive on what reproductive freedom looks like in 2024. They’ll explain where abortion is most severely restricted, how Trump’s Project 2025 thinks about women’s basic health care decisions and what it’s like on the ground for women who need care in states with abortion bans, even in emergencies. But first to today’s strategy session, 96 days. Claire McCaskill: And you know, this is what we usually do if I were in the room. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, I just think it’s going to be really hard for us to do that segment this week because they’re doing everything right. I mean, what can we tell them at this point? Jennifer Palmieri: There’s no second guessing we can do now. Oh, it’s just plenty. Claire McCaskill: I mean, seriously. Listen, they were ready, and it shows she was ready, and it shows. I mean, it really is like stepping off the edge of a cliff when you go from the life she was leading day to day to the life she is leading now. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: As well as anybody. Jen, you have been at the side of a presidential candidate. You know what the pressure is like. Jennifer Palmieri: Particularly when you’re running against this guy. Claire McCaskill: Particularly running against this guy. But she’s got her pace. She seems happy and joyful and confident. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I even have noticed, this is something when you’re a practitioner, you notice these things. I don’t think people understand how hard it is when you are in front of a raucous crowd, how your timing is off, how you pause, how you let the crowd organically rise up and lift you. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: How you wait for that to happen. How you calm them down to try to get to the substantive things you want to say. She has been working her crowds like she is a symphony conductor. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It has really, really been good. And that is not an easy skill. Anybody who’s watched people do it badly know it feels like you’re riding in a bumper car. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know. Whereas this was just smooth and organic and natural. And man, it’s fun to watch. Jennifer Palmieri: And like all good performances, she makes it look easy, but it’s all happening at the right time. And she’s doing a great job prosecuting the case against Trump and the GOP is hitting her on immigration, calling her the border czar, something she never was. Trump’s first campaign ad against her called her and calling her the border czar and blaming her for the border crisis. And then her ad back, I was like, yes, you know, it’s just there’s a lightness to this campaign. You know, it’s joyful. And the notion of not getting bogged down, not getting overwhelmed or giving too much power to the Trump MAGA side by making them scary and fearful, you know, as opposed to just weird. I feel like that has sort of taken the temperature down. And then also to just dismiss out of hand as the Harris campaign ad on immigration does. You know, it’s like there’s a solution on the border, on the table, and you’re the one who killed it. You know, just like boom, right back at them. And that’s supposed to be their big thing, right? That was supposed to be their big issue against them. And she turns it on offense, as you should do, because they are completely full of it. Claire McCaskill: I mean, we could actually go back and pull audio from our early podcast when we were talking about how important it was for the Democrats to play offense on immigration. And this is the best defense is offense. And she is taking a page right out of the Trump marketing guide, which is go after your opponent on their perceived strengths. And that’s what he’s trying to do, but it is exactly what she should be doing with him. And she can do the same thing on energy. She can do the same thing on jobs. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: She can do the same thing on crime because the facts are on her side. And so I love this aggressive going after and every time he comes after her, she’s okay, let’s go. Let’s go. Jennifer Palmieri: And then the National Association of Black Journalists, which, you know, she noted with in the opening was just a bizarre performance from Trump. But the thing I think in the room that goes to their strategy that I want to talk about, it’s this banger from him saying that the vice president only recently turned black. (BEGIN VT) Donald Trump: She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black. And now she wants to be known as black. So I don’t know. Is she Indian or is she black? Unidentified Female: She is always identified as a black. Donald Trump: But you know what, I respect either one. I respect either one. But she obviously doesn’t because she was Indian all the way. And then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she became a black person. Unidentified Female: Just to be clear, sir. Do you believe that she is? (END VT) Jennifer Palmieri: So I had a reporter reach out to me to say just off the record, just wanted to know saying some people thought that this move was just Trump being Trump and just, you know, spewing stuff that comes to the top of his mind or was it a deliberate act to sort of poke at her race? And I think it was a deliberate act. This is what he does. You know, Maggie Haberman noted he only has a few plays, and he does them over and over again. He was hoping, I think, to provoke a larger fight about race to cynically reaffirm for people who are uncomfortable with race or a biracial woman. And the campaign did not engage in that way. Their smart response was, this is just a little snippet of all the kind of crazy MAGA stuff you hear him say at every single rally. The vice president, she was giving a speech last night before a black sorority. She said it was more disrespect, but not presenting it as something new. And what does that fit under the frame of? We’re not going back, right? This is what he does and we’re not going back. I think they were hoping to draw out a bigger fight about race. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. My theory is, first of all, he wasn’t going to get more votes where he needs to get them by doing it. So it doesn’t help him with those swing voters in battleground states. It really wasn’t going to convince more MAGA people to be more MAGA. And so my theory is he was doing it to try to get the conversation off Kamala Harris and back on Donald Trump. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: That he was trying to do something outrageous that would get us all talking about him because he is losing it because we’ve gone for a week and nobody’s paying any attention to him. So I think this was a desperate play to try to get him back on air as somebody who says things you’re never supposed to say. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. And that used to be his strength, right? Claire McCaskill: Yeah. That used to be his strength. And it worked, but in a limited fashion because of the way the campaign handled it. I think her continuing to attack him on him being afraid is so smart, too. I wanted to mention that because -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- we’ve talked many times on this podcast about if I were in the room, I would be trying to get them to emphasize strength because the only thing Donald Trump really has going for him is this perception that he’s, quote unquote, “strong.” It’s wrong. It’s an illusion. He’s not strong. And clearly, she’s got the example to show it now. He’s afraid to debate her. And it kind of wrapped up everything in my mind. What I referenced earlier, how well she’s doing with her crowds, how the messaging is strong and light and joyous. When she did the whole thing, when, you know, you have something to say to me and she smiled and she waited and you saw the crowd behind her shout, say it to my face before the words ever came out of her mouth. That shows she’s in the moment culturally. She understood that most people in that audience would know this is where you stay. Say it to my face. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And it’s one of the reasons why she’s dominating online. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I was talking to Nicolle Wallace yesterday and she was telling me her 12-year-old son, they were talking in the car, and she said, well, who’s winning the internet? He goes, oh, Kamala Harris is winning the internet right now. It’s not even close. It’s fascinating to me that culturally she can be of the moment, but still be so presidential in the way she’s handled that. And say it to my face is going to be a T-shirt if it isn’t already. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, yeah. It’s not already. Yeah, right. Like it used to be four years ago, it was I’m speaking. That was her T-shirt. Now, this is, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: This is a good evolution. Jennifer Palmieri: And then J.D. Vance, you know, he continues to have a tough time. Also, he told donors, he was in a fundraiser, I think he did not think his remarks were being recorded. But he said that the Harris change was a sucker punch for them, which is also such a weird thing to say because it was such an odds for what they were campaigning for, you know, what they had set up their campaign to be. Claire McCaskill: And he’s trying to run from the childless cat lady stuff. But it’s now surfaced three or four different ways. We have audio of him on a podcast in November 2020. We want to share. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) J.D. VANCE: Just these basic cadences of life that I think are really powerful and really, really valuable when you have kids in your life. And the fact that so many people, especially in America’s leadership class, just don’t have that in their lives. You know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less mentally stable. (END AUDIO CLIP) Claire McCaskill: So he went there. He basically called people who don’t have children, sociopaths. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And if people haven’t seen Trey Gowdy’s introduction of him on Fox News -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, it’s so good. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It was so good. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, when you have Trey Gowdy, I mean, a MAGA guy, basically take him to task by pointing out that he made friends with two nuns in an airport who had spent their life giving back and that somehow J.D. Vance didn’t understand that their value to our society is just as much, in fact, in many ways more than people who have children. So it’s what he believes. It’s what he believes. So he can’t really run from it. And obviously, Trump had a hard time explaining that yesterday when he was asked about it. I bet they’re regretting the J.D. Vance pick. If I were in the room, I’d say stay on J.D. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. And it’s interesting to me. You know that Trump is in trouble when the Fox anchors are trying to backpedal. You know, Trey Gowdy had that big windup to show that he wasn’t agreeing with J.D. Vance. And even when one of the female anchors at Fox was interviewing Trump and he was making fun of Harris’s laugh, and she was like, well, I mean, you know, people have, you know, it’s good for people to laugh. Even she’s trying to distance herself. But also, we’re not getting cocky friends because I have been here before. This feels very much like the moment in October of 2016 after the “Access Hollywood” tape and then the dozens of women that came out and accused Trump of sexual assault. And it sure looked like America would not elect that man president and they went ahead and did it anyway. And there is a large percentage in this country who will vote for him no matter what. So it’s like all great. What the Harris campaign has accomplished in about 10 days is getting her neck and neck with Trump in these battleground polls and the tough part is yet to come. Claire McCaskill: So we aren’t going to dig into all the polls this week. We’ll continue to watch them. But suffice it to say, they’re good. The swing is occurring. Battleground states, it’s still close. Like you said, there’s a lot of work to do. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: But she still has the convention, and she has the VP pick that could help even further those numbers. Let’s just guess. Let’s just guess. Who’s it going to be? Jennifer Palmieri: I think Shapiro. And if it’s not, there’s some problem. I mean, that just makes the most sense to me. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think it’s Shapiro, too. And if it’s not Shapiro, it’s one of the other governors. Jennifer Palmieri: Well -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I believe it’s one of the governors. So we’ll see. You know, we may look stupid next week, but we’ll know. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, heavens, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Well, that’ll be new. Whatever will we do? Oh, my Lord. I won’t be able to sleep at night. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, Andy Beshear. I was like, what’s the other governor? Yeah, Walz. And I just came from Kentucky. Just spent two days at a very cool farm down there. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: And this will happen soon. We’ll pause here. And when we’re back, Claire sits down with the head of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, for a detailed conversation about abortion rights and what’s at stake in this election. Trust me, you don’t want to miss this one. Back in a moment (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. While the news this week is largely focused on the seismic shift in the presidential campaign, there’s another battle that continues, and it is growing and metastasizing. This week, Iowa joined a growing list of states that bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy before many women. I might even argue most women even though they are pregnant. So we wanted to zero in on that continuing struggle for women to have the freedom to make their own health care decisions, to have access to health care and complete agency over their own bodies. To give us the sense of urgency of this fight, especially when it comes to winning November, Alexis McGill Johnson joins me now. She’s the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She’s been part of Planned Parenthood’s leadership for more than a decade and also co-founded and co-directed the Perception Institute. Welcome, Alexis. Great to have you. Alexis McGill Johnson: Thanks for having me, Claire. Good to be here. Claire McCaskill: My daughter worked for the National Office of Planned Parenthood for a number of years, and so I am always pleased to have the people who are on the front lines as part of our conversation. And by the way, I think this part of the conversation probably has more to do with the title of our podcast than maybe any other we’ve covered, and that’s “How to Win in 2024.” So especially thrilled to have you here. I know how busy you are. Let’s start with the Iowa abortion ban. Alexis McGill Johnson: Sure. Claire McCaskill: It went into effect on Monday. It joins a number of states, including my state, in banning most abortions. So let’s talk about what impact that’s going to have on the women of Iowa, because we talk about the ban, but we don’t many times look at it from a personal point of view. So what is different for a woman in Iowa who finds out she is pregnant today versus Monday? Alexis McGill Johnson: I mean, it’s devastating what happened in Iowa this week. And you’re right, it joins, you know, Florida, Texas, Missouri, and a number of states that essentially have said they don’t trust women. We are now at 22 states that have restrictions or total bans on abortion, which affects about 43% of all women, right? So just like the scale of what we are talking about right now two years after Dobbs. So what’s different is that now a woman finds out she’s pregnant, she doesn’t want to be, she has to go and try to get an appointment before six weeks. As you said, she may not know she’s pregnant at that point. She will have to seek an appointment out of state and make plans, right? She may have to make plans for travel, to take time off from work, to get up the resources, to get out of state. And that’s all if she is able to, right? You know, we have seen over the last couple of years, patients who’ve come through Planned Parenthood who are unable to get out of state. They are in relationships that are violent, they are underage, they may have an immigration status where they can’t travel. There are just so many different things that can affect just one’s movement. And now we’re asking people to go out of state to get access to care. It’s horrific. And I think what we have seen over the last couple of years is obviously abortion bans haven’t stopped people from seeking access to abortion, but we have seen abortion bans make pregnancy more dangerous. We are seeing the impact on patients who are miscarrying early. Now they have to also get access out of state. It’s really cruel and chaotic and confusing, both for the patients and for the providers. Claire McCaskill: So for the providers, let’s talk about the instance. I was traveling with my daughter, and she was 10 weeks pregnant, 11 weeks pregnant, and she suffered a miscarriage. We were in another state besides our home state, and I think about what we did and how we handled it and how she handled it and how traumatic it was, even being in a state where she was welcomed into an emergency room and got the care she needed. What is happening to women who miscarry in these states where there’s a complete ban, or where there is a limitation of, say, six weeks, like in Iowa? When they are in the process of miscarrying, are they being turned away from emergency rooms at this point? Is that what’s going on? Alexis McGill Johnson: You know, first of all, the providers are doing everything they can to try to help patients. And I think we really do have to center the experience of the patients, but also the providers who desperately want to provide the care that they need. So oftentimes they may send a patient to a parking lot to wait until, you know, essentially sepsis sets in so that they can justify under whatever exception rule or whatever medical board inside of the hospital that they can provide the care. But imagine what that means, right? Both you are sending a patient out to a parking lot for a life-threatening condition, and then you are asking a provider to call their lawyer or call the hospital administration to essentially get approval to take care of the patient. And so that’s what’s happening. We heard about it in Idaho as the U.S. government sued Idaho to enforce the EMTALA, the emergency medicine rule that abortions need to be provided in such instances. And in Idaho, they were airlifting patients out of state who were miscarrying because the providers were so worried about their own license. It’s just unspeakable. Claire McCaskill: It is unspeakable. And you know, I think about those hours where a child I love desperately was in agony for a whole lot of reasons. I mean, this was a pregnancy she really wanted, and she was traumatized. It was her first pregnancy. She was in pain. And I think about if we had been in the wrong state at that moment now after Dobbs, with these restrictions going in place, just the anger I feel that somebody would say to her to go sit in the parking lot. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And talk about violate the Hippocratic Oath, you’re supposed to do no harm. Alexis McGill Johnson: Exactly. Claire McCaskill: How does telling a woman in that situation to wait in a parking lot do no harm? Especially because it makes it feel like to the woman that somehow, she’s done something wrong. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes. Claire McCaskill: It is just infuriating. Where in the country now, so people know to be forewarned, where in the country now are the most draconian restrictions where a woman could really be in danger in terms of her health if she had a medical emergency around a pregnancy Well, I mean, you know, when you look at the map of abortion bans, right, what you see are essentially if you leave the northeast, you know, you stop in Virginia, that is the last entry point in the south where there is not a restriction. And you got to go all the way down and make a left to get to New Mexico before you can get access to care again, right. Think about the broad swath of the country, 22 states. We’re talking about Texas. We’re talking about Idaho. We’re talking about Oklahoma. We’re talking about Alabama. Florida now has a six-week ban. So the volume of patients that are having to travel, right, having to get on planes, travel upwards 18 hours by car just to get to a state where they can get access to care and all that has to go with it, right, all that has to go with it. Getting the appointment, spending the resources to find childcare, because most people who have abortions are already parents. So there’s a lot that they have to engage in just to get that access. I know there are resources that have grown since Dobbs to help women in these situations. Are there some easy places that you can point people to where they can learn about accessing some of the resources that people have generously donated? Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes. Claire McCaskill: To try to help women who are financially in a situation where travel is an impossibility for them? Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes. So we partnered with Power to Decide on abortionfinder.org, which is a kind of one-stop destination where you can find out both the state of play, right, because some of these states are being litigated and that’s the confusion of not knowing exactly what’s available in any given moment. And then also accessing abortion funds. There is a network of abortion funds that also provides care. Planned Parenthood, we have patient navigation in our affiliated network so that patients are able to call, and someone will stay with them on their journey from a banned state into a state where they can get access and help them kind of pull together the set of resources that they need. Claire McCaskill: I know a lot of states have taken things into their own hands. We saw it happen in Ohio. We saw it happen in Kansas, notably early in a state that no one, frankly, that was really the seismic shift that people began feeling that when Kansas voted the way it did to protect women and their health decisions. I know we have one on the ballot in Missouri. Missouri is not considered a battleground, unfortunately. But it’s still very important that people in Missouri know that we have an opportunity to take some freedom back that the Supreme Court snatched away. But where are the states where there are initiatives on the ballot that you believe can help? The down-ballot races, the presidential races, gubernatorial races, that people need to be aware of that these are initiatives that have, by and large, just been done by initiative petitions. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Women who are mad as hell, who have gone out and hit the bricks and gotten people to sign papers to say, we want to vote on this. It really is kind of cool. Alexis McGill Johnson: It’s been amazing to watch, right? I mean, we have everywhere where reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, we have won. And, you know, there are some key states that are going to be critical this cycle. So, first of all, Florida has a ballot initiative that also has a Senate race. We know that Florida becomes a critical access point for so many patients. And so that ballot initiative is critical. Arizona also has a Senate race and is a critical battleground state and has a ballot initiative to codify Roe. Nevada, just actually got back from Nevada this weekend. We have Senate races. We have frontline races. We have a presidential race. And we have Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, also a ballot initiative to codify Roe. We have one in Montana. Again, we have another great Senate race there. And, you know, and I don’t want to lose the fact that we had ballot initiatives in Ohio and a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin and a ballot initiative in Michigan over the last three years. So the infrastructure around fighting for reproductive freedom and connecting the dots to why it is so important to come out in ‘24 in those three states that we know are going to be critically important in the presidential. You know that infrastructure still exists, and I think the momentum that we have seen around just direct democracy, as you as you named, people who are just mad as hell, who are outraged, who cannot believe that after 49 years, a fundamental right was taken away and that our children literally are growing up with less rights than we have. And they are doing something about it. And so the energy has been really, really incredible. Claire McCaskill: Is there anything on the ballot in Texas? Alexis McGill Johnson: There is not. You know, Texas, there’s a challenge, right? At some point, we run out of states where we can engage in direct democracy, where we can engage in ballot initiatives, because they have gerrymandered their way to stay in power. And in order to get a ballot on in Texas, it has to pass threshold of 60 percent of the legislators in the statehouse. Claire McCaskill: Oh, wow. Alexis McGill Johnson: Right. So, you know, they’re finding ways. Claire McCaskill: So much for freedom. Alexis McGill Johnson: So much for freedom. Exactly. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so we’re going to talk about why the presidential race is so important to women in this country around the destruction of Roe v. Wade and the Dobbs decision. We’re going to do that right after a short break. We’re going to dig into the whole Project 2025 and the weirdness that is J.D. Vance and Donald Trump around this issue, and we’ll be right back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. I’ve been speaking with Alexis McGill Johnson, the head of Planned Parenthood. Alexis, before we let you go on your way with your life today, which I’m sure is very busy. I know you were trying to take care of your daughter before we got on the air. I want to get in here that you’re not one of those childless cat ladies that is our sociopathic enemy of the state, you know, because we know that’s something that we’re all worried about. I want to talk about Kamala Harris at the head of the ticket and I want to talk about Project 2025 and the stark contrast between those two realities. Kamala Harris has been out there on this issue, and I want to talk about her leadership on this issue and how strong she has been throughout. I think now everyone’s paying really close attention to Kamala Harris. But for those of us who care about this issue, she’s been out there leading the charge now for months on end. Alexis McGill Johnson: Oh, years. Are you kidding me? She’s not new to this. She’s true to this, as the kids say. I mean, we have been with her since before Dobbs, right? Since SB8 went into effect, you know, been on the trail with her kind of learning, kind of bringing her to our communities to meet with patients, to meet with providers, to meet with state lawmakers across the country. And she has been on a reproductive freedom tour, really a tear for the last couple of years, showing up as this administration’s kind of strongest spokesperson for what is important and possible. And, you know, as you know, being with her in the Senate, we saw her grill Justice Kavanaugh. We saw her introduce mom-to-bus legislation to protect maternal health. And she speaks now very clearly about her past prosecutorial life and all the things for which people would need access to broad sexual and reproductive health care. So she’s just an authentic advocate. She comes to it in a very real, personal way. And I feel like there is a, I don’t know, a radical realignment that’s happening that’s running right through reproductive freedom. And having her at the head of the ticket in this moment has just put a lot of energy and a lot of boost into the election, but also into this issue again. Claire McCaskill: In the contrast, we’re talking about the light. Now we’re going to talk about the dark, which I got to tell you, this is a brief story. When I was a young state representative, we were debating an abortion legislation. As you know, Missouri has been home to a number of challenges over the years, and some have made their way to the Supreme Court. And some of us were arguing for a rape and incest exception to laws that were going to clearly pass in Missouri. And one of my colleagues, a black state rep from St. Louis, got up on the floor, and I’ll never forget the speech he gave because he looked around the room and he said, you know, all of you are sanctimonious and you want to vote to deny women their rights. And that’s because the sun is shining. But I see you all at night. Oh, the night when you are with women you shouldn’t be with and when you are really worried about whether or not they get pregnant. I mean, he went there and all of the women, there were only like maybe 12 of us in the room, you know, we all our jaws just dropped and went, you go guy, you go guy. The night, oh, the night. So we’ve talked about the bright daylight, which is represented by Kamala Harris on this issue. But the night, the darkness is represented by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. And I know that Jessica Valenti does a Substack newsletter called Abortion Every Day. She’s done a deep dive on Project 2025. Let’s talk about what this document, which has been birthed by Trump associates for the purpose of informing what they want to do. It’s called 2025 for a reason. It’s not called 2032. It’s not called 2022. It’s called 2025. Talk about what’s in that document and how frightening it is to everybody who has sex in America. Alexis McGill Johnson: Project 2025, Trump’s Project 2025, as much as he wants to distance himself from it, is one of the most frightening things that I have read. And I have looked at all 990 pages of it because the audacity of putting out a playbook, right, putting out a playbook where they felt so confident to put into print they want a national abortion ban, that they want to criminalize mifepristone, medication abortion, that they want to reverse the FDA’s approval of Mifepristone, that they want to change the name of the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of Life, right, so that they can continue to drive draconian, more draconian measures from the national level. And to do it in ways, Claire, that are really, in many ways, through executive order, right, enforcing things like the Comstock Act, so that they don’t even have to engage with the Senate, right. They don’t have to engage with the House. They can actually just do these things through executive power. And, you know, when you have a former president who is perfectly fine saying, you’ll never have to vote again after four years if you just get me in, or I’ll only be dictator for one day, and the confidence with which they have put forth this playbook, it’s clear that the intent is to have a national abortion ban, to use the full power of the executive office to do that, and to ensure that he can get away with anything. Now that he has immunity, he can continue to get away with anything. That, I think, is the most frightening thing. And I think that’s also what is animating voters right now. Claire McCaskill: And I wish everyone, I wish we could make Project 2025 mandatory reading for everyone. I have taken the time to wade through as much of it as I could stomach. I was fascinated, as somebody who was a former prosecutor myself, and who, for a long time, I was the only woman in the office in Kansas City, and so therefore, I got assigned all the sexual assault cases. So I’ve handled literally hundreds of rape cases. And this idea that they’re going to rename the morning after pill to the week after pill, and the idea that they’re going to redefine emergency contraception as an abortifacient, as opposed to a preventative thing that a woman who’s been raped would get, at her option, obviously. It’s not mandatory, but it is offered that when she is reporting a rape and is undergoing a medical examination for a rape kit, the harassment this document would allow for women in trauma is just off the charts. What do you think, and do they actually think America is going to accept this kind of going back to the past? Talk about dark alleys. Alexis McGill Johnson: I mean, yeah, the enforcement of these laws would require women to have to report on their rapists. The level of surveillance, right? I mean, you know, J.D. Vance talking about, like, how are we going to understand that they are stopping people from crossing state lines? You know, like the amount of surveillance, right? And the amount of invasion of privacy that has to accompany these horrific bans and restrictions, I think, is also something that we haven’t played out fully for people. And I think that’s like a big question, right, for me. How do you enforce these laws? How do you enforce some of the craziest restrictions? And then what will it mean, right, for patients who need to get access, but also the providers, right? I think that there’s something really important to understand about what is happening to the provider community right now. There has been a 10% decline of OBGYN residents matching into banned states. And so what that means is now these restrictions that will come even further with Project 2025 are decimating not just abortion care, but also broad maternal health care, particularly providers who have to provide or are trained to provide in high-risk maternal care, right? So for many of us who have later-in-life pregnancies, needing advanced maternal care is critical. So you don’t trust women so much that you’re willing to actually devastate and decimate an entire profession. And our ability to make decisions of if, when, and how we decide to build a family, it’s so counterintuitive. Or, I mean, it’s just so weird. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, we’ve gotten to the point because of Dobbs that OBGYNs feel like they have to have a direct line to lawyers. Alexis McGill Johnson: That’s right. Claire McCaskill: And that’s just weird. It is just not good that a doctor has to somehow check themselves before giving the care that they think their patient needs. It violates everything about the standards of care in medicine. And, you know, the point you make about enforcement, I think it’s really important to emphasize this. The Democratic senators realized that in some of these states, what could occur is a blanket subpoenaing of women’s health records. In our state, we caught the Department of Health trying to track women’s periods. We actually caught them doing that. Alexis McGill Johnson: Yes, yeah. Claire McCaskill: And so they put a bill forward to limit the ability of law enforcement, police, to be able to subpoena women’s private medical records. Now, obviously, if it was something where there was a basis for it because a crime had been committed, but just to investigate potential violations of abortion restrictions, they wanted to limit the ability of police to do that. Now, think about this. Twenty-eight United States senators voted against that bill. This was just a few months ago. Twenty-eight of them. That’s a fourth of the representation in the United States Senate voted that, no, we’ve got to give police the ability to go poking around in women’s private medical records. And guess who was one of the senators who voted with the 28? That would be none other than J.D. Vance, who also voted against protecting contraception, who also voted against protecting IVF. So there you have it, the trifecta. And they want the cops in your medical records finding out when you had a period, see if they can catch you. They want to make sure you can’t have IVF so that you can have children that you and your family desperately want. And at the end of the day, they want to make sure that you can’t prevent a pregnancy from happening in the first place, which would avoid the need for any abortion. So it is crazy what these folks are trying to do to our country. Alexis McGill Johnson: It’s crazy and it’s creepy. I remember when the state health commissioner in Missouri was tracking, I think, Planned Parenthood patient periods. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Alexis McGill Johnson: In an Excel file. What kind of creep wants to be tracking women’s cycles to understand what they’re doing with their reproduction? The invasion of it and the fact that that mentality is so embedded in, as you said, a fourth of our Congress. That is just insane. Claire McCaskill: Yup. Alexis McGill Johnson: That’s just insane. Claire McCaskill: Well, I want to thank, first of all, I want to thank you. And I want to thank the thousands of men and women who work with and for Planned Parenthood. I confronted a young state senator in my state who was a woman who was railing against Planned Parenthood. And I looked at her in a kind of quasi-public setting. I said, you know, Sarah, I’m just curious, where did you get the pill when you were in college? And there was a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (ph) because that was certainly my first encounter with Planned Parenthood, was access to the pill at a point in my life where it was very important that I wanted to make sure I didn’t get pregnant. So I just don’t think we thank you guys enough. There are thousands of volunteers. There’s thousands of people that are working across this country to make sure that there are still safe places where women can get all the health care that they richly deserve. We want to wish you the very best and tell all the troops that we’re proud of the work they’re doing and to continue the fight because we’ve got a lot to fight for. Alexis McGill Johnson: We are on it, and we really appreciate you for being such an incredible reproductive freedom champion. You’ve always been and continue to carry the message here and we appreciate you. Claire McCaskill: You bet. Alexis McGill Johnson is the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. She’s been part of Planned Parenthood’s leadership for more than a decade.

Disappointing jobs report sends unmistakable signal to the Fed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 6:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/disappointing-jobs-report-sends-unmistakable-signal-fed-rcna164840,"Expectations heading into this morning showed projections of about 185,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in July. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market didn’t fare quite that well. CNBC reported: The jump in the unemployment rate was especially notable: In July 2023, the rate was 3.5%, and 12 months later, it’s 4.3%. It’s why the public is about to hear a lot about the “Sahm Rule.” But as the public digests the latest figures, it’s worth emphasizing that the Federal Reserve, hoping to combat inflation, kept interest rates high, knowing it would cool the job market. The recent slowdown, in other words, isn’t an accident; it’s a deliberate outcome of the Fed’s strategy. It’s also why the obvious reaction to today’s jobs report will be renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve for a meaningful rate cut in September — at the latest. As for the politics, let’s circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump’s presidency — when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet — the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018 and 2019. According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16.2 million jobs since January 2021 — more than double the combined total of Trump’s first three years. For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions: 2013: 2.3 million 2014: 3 million 2015: 2.7 million 2016: 2.3 million 2017: 2.1 million 2018: 2.3 million 2019: 1.98 million 2020: -9.3 million 2021: 7.2 million 2022: 4.5 million 2023: 3 million Seven months into 2024: 1.4 million This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Why Trump isn’t celebrating as Americans return home from Russia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 5:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-isnt-celebrating-americans-return-home-russia-rcna164827,"As President Joe Biden’s term enters its homestretch, it stands to reason that the Democratic incumbent might be thinking about his legacy and his accomplishments. If so, it’s quite likely that Biden realizes that Thursday’s developments, and his role in making them happen, won’t soon be forgotten. NBC News reported: Biden described the diplomatic efforts that led to the release of the four U.S. detainees a “feat of diplomacy and friendship,” which was more than fair given the circumstances. Indeed, given the available details, the story reads like a dramatic film involving international intrigue, secret talks, complex diplomacy, and reunited families. But as the credits rolled, and audiences cheered, Donald Trump sat on his hands. It would’ve been easy for the Republican nominee to celebrate the return of Americans who’d been unjustly detained by Russia, but the former president instead published a biting missive to his social media platform, posing a series of barbed questions that made his annoyance clear. After asking whether the Biden administration was giving Russia “cash” — the White House had already answered that question, explaining that Russia would not get money from the agreement — Trump complained that officials from his own country “never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps.” In case that weren’t quite enough, the GOP candidate went on to write, “Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING. ... “They’re calling the trade ‘complex’ — That’s so nobody can figure out how bad it is!” For now, let’s put aside the fact that when Trump claimed he gave up “nothing” to get Americans back, he was brazenly lying. Instead, let’s focus on why the former president’s first instinct was to whine about good news for his own country. Trump can’t claim credit: Sure, some Republican partisans, including his running mate, peddled silly claims about the former president playing some indirect role in the developments, but Trump seemed to realize that he had nothing to do with this. And if Trump can’t plausibly claim credit for good news, then the news, practically by definition, can’t be good. Trump said this wouldn’t happen: The Republican spent months publicly arguing that he, and he alone, would have the wherewithal to bring Gershkovich home. Oops. Trump almost certainly couldn’t have pulled this off: The lynchpin of the deal was diplomatic work with Germany. When Trump was in office, he tapped a notorious online pest to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Germany, where he managed to routinely infuriate our allies in Berlin. In fact, Trumps ambassador was so reviled that some German officials spoke publicly about the possibility of asking him to leave the country. The agreement was the result of alliances that Biden strengthened and Trump intends to weaken: As Biden explained on Thursday, he and his team “rebuilt NATO. We rebuilt the circumstances to allow this to happen. That’s why it happened.” These are the same alliances, of course, that Trump has been hostile toward for years. No wonder the GOP nominee isn’t happy."
The Harris honeymoon ends soon. She'd better be ready for what's next.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 2, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-energized-democrats-party-faces-maga-republicans-rcna164603,"Democrats have had a remarkable two weeks, as Vice President Kamala Harris has re-energized their hopes for retaining the White House and definitively turning the page on the Trump era. But it’s only been two weeks. Even in the most abbreviated general election campaign in modern history, the likely Democratic nominee will face three full months of negative advertising, blunders and bad luck, just like any other candidate. As the honeymoon phase comes to a close, the newly cemented Harris campaign needs to lay the groundwork for what’s next, take advantage of its tremendous grassroots support across the country, and prepare a counteroffensive to the coming attacks. Last week on MSNBC, veteran Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats to “get ready. They’re coming after us.” He added, “This kind of giddy elation is not gonna be very helpful much longer.” Carville’s comments weren’t directed at voters, but instead at the Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee. As the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, I view his warning as a message to those in power within the Democratic Party to get to work. Over the next three months, Democrats at all levels need to harness the enthusiasm for Harris into action. The Trump campaign was caught off guard by the quick consolidation of support for the vice president, but Democrats need to prepare for a full-throated attack. MAGA Republicans won’t go down without a fight. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s combative interview at the National Association of Black Journalists conference — in which he went after her race and gender directly — followed by his social media posts and a speech by vice presidential nominee JD Vance criticizing her as “chameleon-like” flip-flopper have shown that the gloves are already coming off. Trump’s Republican Party sees this election as a last chance at holding power. Look no further than Project 2025. Trump-aligned conservatives at the Heritage Foundation didn’t spend years on an agenda to overhaul our nation’s institutions for nothing. The MAGA movement will work tooth and nail to win this election so they can implement a far-right authoritarian takeover. Don’t let the head fake of the Trump campaign “distancing” itself from Project 2025 fool you. These are the stakes of the 2024 presidential election, and the Harris campaign should know what it’s up against. Trump and his allies will resort to vicious attacks in an attempt to define Harris. Some of those lines of attack will land in the minds of some voters. As the boxer Mike Tyson famously said, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. A good team of advisers and strong messaging should help them navigate those moments. The shift to Harris may stymie Trump and his campaign, but they’re already pouring millions of dollars into TV ads in battleground states. This new advertising blitz is part of Trump’s effort to define Harris as a failed “border czar” (a title she did not have, though that will not deter them). Immigration is a major vulnerability for Democrats and the Harris campaign, but they can undercut this weakness with the right messaging. Harris wasted no time reframing the issue on her terms this week in Atlanta. She spent the first part of her stump speech highlighting her tenure as California attorney general. Harris touted her record of prosecuting transnational gang members and human traffickers who came to the U.S. illegally. She also reminded voters that Trump pressured Senate Republicans to block a bipartisan deal to secure the border. Harris told the crowd, “Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.” The Harris campaign knows it can’t sit around and let Trump control the narrative. That’s why Harris wasted no time building a narrative of her own. She’s a former prosecutor and Trump is a criminal. This early stage of any campaign is a battle of definitions, and the contrast is stark. While energy and excitement are great for raising money and gathering volunteers, if you haven’t prepared to be smacked upside the head by an asymmetrical political actor, all that money and energy won’t be enough to break through that wall on Election Day. Democrats should seize on this moment of enthusiasm, but they can’t get caught up in the moment. The goal now should be manifesting this bolt of energy into a three-month game plan to win at the ballot box. From now until Nov. 5, every day matters. The Harris campaign needs to make the most of every minute. As a former party chairman, I know every moment counts.

What it takes to free an American detained abroad,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 4:45 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/russia-prisoner-swap-evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-rcna164749,"The patriotic, perhaps most human, reaction to Thursday’s release of multiple Americans held hostage in Russia — including journalist Evan Gershkovich and security contractor Paul Whelan — is to welcome them home with open arms and take a moment to appreciate that the U.S. government is willing to go to bat for its people when they travel abroad. Unfortunately, that simple axiom hides a tricky calculus of how countries often effectively kidnap people under false pretenses to gain an advantage in the game of geopolitical chess. Countries like China, Iran, North Korea and Russia often use a tactic once reserved for militants and revolutionary groups: scooping people up and using them as political bargaining chips. When hostages were taken by Al Qaeda in Pakistan or the FARC in Peru, the U.S. government was also able to work with and pressure local governments to bring Americans home safely.  As Thursday’s prisoner swap indicates, things have shifted in more recent years — rogue governments themselves see an advantage in violating diplomatic norms of goodwill to visitors.  Regimes like Russia’s will grant visas to Americans and then levy charges to turn them into prisoners, with the expectation they will gain concessions for their release. Journalists, like Gershkovich, who are shedding light on the realities of life in those countries, are brought up on charges of espionage. Athletes like Brittney Griner, who played basketball professionally in Russia for more than a decade, was detained on drug trafficking charges and sentenced well beyond the usual time for marijuana possession.  According to the James Foley Foundation, this wrongful detention trend reached a height in 2022; currently more than 40 Americans are still wrongly detained for an average of five years, the majority of them in China and Russia. As legal prisoners of a foreign government, these Americans can’t be rescued by a stealth SEAL team; they must go through a court process and country-to-country negotiations for even the possibility of a prisoner exchange. To further complicate matters, many held in these foreign legal systems are dual nationals who are also subject to the laws of both countries. Until the court case is resolved, U.S. lawyers and diplomats can’t intervene without being accused of violating the authority and sovereignty of the host country. Even getting the U.S. secretary of state to make a formal declaration of wrongful detention is a secretive process, something families of detained people have decried for years. The unfortunate truth is the American system doesn’t have a good answer for what to do about bad actors’ being incentivized to use people as political pawns. But the U.S. government can at least do right by the families of people held in unjust foreign captivity by being more transparent and declassifying information about their loved ones’ captivity. More broadly, in moments when our adversaries try to use our people and values against us, the U.S. government shouldn’t hesitate to double down on what makes us distinct from these autocratic regimes — standing up for individual rights and protecting our people abroad."
Why Kamala Harris’ biracial identity upsets Donald Trump so much,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 4:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-interview-kamala-harris-black-indian-nabj-rcna164736,"Early in Donald Trump’s meltdown at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists convention, the former president offered unsolicited commentary on the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. “She was Indian all the way,” Trump said of his presumptive opponent, “and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person. Somebody should look into that.” There is a multitude of problems with Trump’s comments, from his presumption that he has the expertise and jurisdiction to judge someone else’s identity to his argument that Harris lacks the racial bona fides to merit the Black audience members’ allegiance. But the former president’s ramble offers another important conclusion: Trump simply doesn’t understand race. When Trump asks for somebody to “look into that,” the truth is that for years researchers have looked into that. What they’ve found is that overly simplified perspectives on race like Trump’s are not only misplaced, but they are counterproductive and dangerous. Scholars of race have long argued, and demonstrated, that race is a socially constructed category that still has very real outcomes. We, as members of society, constantly construct, deconstruct and reconstruct what race means. Even the basics of how race is measured in America have evolved over time. The 1850 U.S. census was the first to acknowledge people of multiracial descent, with the category “Mulatto” used as a way to exclude them from having full political rights. Not until the 2000 census were multiracial Americans able to formally mark more than one racial identity. In fact, the multiracial population is the fastest growing racial group in the United States, with a 276% increase between 2010 and 2020. As ABC News’ Rachel Scott pointed out to Trump, Harris “has always identified as a Black woman. She went to a historically Black college.” (Harris graduated from Howard University, where she was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically African American sorority.) But in Trump’s worldview, you’re either Indian or you’re Black. You cannot be both. This is ironic considering his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, is the father of three biracial (Indian and white) children. Trump doubled down on this sentiment after the NABJ interview: At his rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that same day, his campaign displayed a graphic quoting Harris as having referred to herself as the “first Indian-American senator.” Which, of course, she was. And which, of course, does nothing to disprove her Blackness, because she is both. Trump fails to grasp what census takers recognized more than two decades ago and what Walt Whitman wrote two centuries ago: We contain multitudes. Harris is Indian. Harris is Black. This isn’t a contradiction. Trump’s recent comments mark but one in a series of episodes showing he shares a misunderstanding all too common even in today’s increasingly diverse and multiracial society: the (hyper) essentializing of race and other social categories. Researchers describe essentialism as seeing particular qualities as being intrinsic or inherent to a particular group of people. These beliefs (e.g., all women are bad at math) start to form in early childhood and can further solidify as one ages depending on one’s further socialization. Trump’s false confidence in the essentialized either/or nature of identity leads him to believe that once he knows what you are, he’ll also know how you’ll think and act. It opens the door to thinking that Jewish voters who opt for his opponent are “bad Jews,” his frequent claims about the monolithic notion of “Black jobs,” and referring to anyone who criticizes Israel — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer — as “a Palestinian,” even if Schumer was born in Brooklyn. Acknowledging the existence of multiracial identities completely scrambles this perspective and upsets the stereotypes that Trump holds close to his heart. People can claim more than one identity without being disingenuous. Our identities are not limited to those labels others apply to us. Individuals who share aspects of their identities — whether race, gender, religion or otherwise — cannot be expected to all think, act or vote in the same way. It is likely too late for Trump to accept and fully grasp that millions of Americans are multiracial. But we hope that his racist comments will prompt other Americans to think more flexibly about identity."

The massive deal, cut among seven nations, involves 24 people, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens held in Russia, and eight Russians imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Slovenia, Norway and Poland.” * In the Middle East: “Mourners in Iran and Lebanon commemorated slain militant leaders Thursday, as they vowed retribution against common enemy Israel and signaled that the most recent paroxysm of violence gripping the Middle East may be far from over.” * Trump’s latest legal setback: “A New York appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump’s bid to dismiss the partial gag order against him in his criminal case. Trump had argued the gag order was unnecessary and should be dismissed after his conviction in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 campaign. A five-judge panel of the state Appellate Division, a mid-level appeals court, disagreed.” * An important plea deal: “The man accused of plotting the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and two of his accomplices have agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and murder charges in exchange for a life sentence rather than a death-penalty trial at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, prosecutors said Wednesday.” * A story worth watching: “Moldova’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday it has expelled a Russian diplomat after two Moldovan officials were detained on suspicion of treason and conspiracy against the European Union candidate country.” * In Utah: “The Utah Supreme Court upheld on Thursday a suspension of the state’s near-total ban on abortion, meaning the procedure remains legal while a court challenge to the law proceeds.” * Right-wing social media posts claimed a suspected murder in the United Kingdom was an undocumented immigrant. The claims were false, but riots happened anyway: “Seeking to quell a surge of misinformation-fueled unrest, a British judge on Thursday took the unusual step of naming the 17-year-old suspect in a stabbing rampage that left three children dead and eight injured in northwestern England early this week.” See you tomorrow."
Donald Trump has always been ‘weird.’ Here's why it won’t work against Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-weird-kamala-harris-rcna164753,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Way Too Early."" Let’s talk about Donald Trump’s week.  Things started to kick off on Tuesday with Trump policing who is and isn’t a good Jew. The former president called a conservative radio show to escalate his attacks on Jewish Democrats, calling them “fools” and saying they “should have their heads examined.” Then on Wednesday, Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania where he mistakenly referred to Republican Senate candidate David McCormick as the state’s “next governor.” Twice.  Earlier that same day, Trump made an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference and took aim at his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris — accusing Harris, who's biracial, of “turning Black.” So in 24 hours, Trump went from deciding who’s a good Jew to who’s really Black or who’s really Asian.  This is a guy who is clearly struggling to find his footing against Harris. So what does he do? He goes back to his original playbook, one that dates back even further than 2016. He’s trying to play the greatest hits of birtherism all over again. Ever since the Republican Party’s convention it seems Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have leaned into the weirdness. It’s almost like Trump is saying, “Boy, you know that Vance is really weird. Hold my beer, because look what I’m going to do here.” But Trump’s appearances aren’t a one-off. What we witnessed this week is pure Donald Trump. This is who he is. This is what he looks like when he’s in a somewhat hostile environment and asked tough questions. He has a meltdown. This is a moment in American politics where you step back and realize that you have the Republican candidate for president playing the race card and engaging in some of the worst kinds of racial stereotyping. It's a repulsive moment in American politics, but it’s also a reminder of what Trump is doing and all he represents."
"Trump is right about ‘two systems of justice,’ but for the wrong reasons",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-two-systems-of-justice-jan-6-pardon-rcna164658,"Donald Trump complained about “two systems of justice” when asked at a National Association of Black Journalists panel discussion about his support for Jan. 6 defendants. But to the extent that those criminal defendants (including Trump) have been treated differently, they’ve fared better than the average defendant on multiple fronts. Take their Supreme Court success, for example. As we know, the court recently bestowed broad criminal immunity on former presidents, which happens to help the GOP presidential nominee in his own criminal cases. In another appeal this past term, the court narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. The justices didn’t have to intervene in either dispute — indeed, they reject most appeals — much less rule how they did. On top of help from the justices, journalist Radley Balko observed that Jan. 6 defendants have been largely at liberty before trial, with the courts being “far more likely to release Capitol rioters pre-trial than other defendants.” There’s also the special treatment that Trump has vowed to apply on the back end of the criminal process if he returns to the White House. He said Wednesday that he would “absolutely” pardon Jan. 6 defendants “if they’re innocent.” Likewise, if he wins in November, Trump may also attempt a legally untested self-pardon, though he may more likely have his newly installed attorney general dismiss his two federal cases; presidents can’t pardon people for state charges. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases and was found guilty in the one case that has gone to trial so far, in New York.) That’s saying nothing of any revenge he would seek to exact if he regains power, something that would solidify a two-tiered justice system — but not how he meant.

Trump makes callous joke while honoring the man killed at his Butler rally,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-corey-comperatore-widow-rcna164738,"Near the start of his speech at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Donald Trump spoke about Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the shooting at the former president’s campaign rally last month. Trump held a moment of silence for Comperatore, whom he called ""a hero to all of us."" Yet even as he honored the late firefighter, Trump appeared to make an off-the-cuff quip while talking about his widow’s grief. The GOP presidential nominee told the crowd that a friend of his had given Comperatore's family a $1 million check, and he also made reference to money donated to the family's GoFundMe. ""But you know what? Corey's wife said, 'I'd rather have my husband,'” Trump said. “Isn’t that good? I know a lot of wives that would not say that — I’m sorry,"" he continued, as the crowd laughed. ""They would not say that."" Trump's unfiltered manner of speaking has long been a quality reviled by his critics and beloved by his supporters. His crude attempts at levity and flippant comments in somber situations — especially while he was in office — have contributed to a longstanding perception that he's callous and unempathetic. Comperatore, 50, was killed while trying to protect his wife and two young daughters when a 20-year-old gunman opened fire at Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Two other men, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were critically wounded but have since been released from the hospital. Comperatore's family said that Trump reached out to them days after the shooting. His widow, Helen Comperatore, has said that President Joe Biden also called her family that weekend, but she declined to speak with him out of respect for her husband, who she said was a ""devout Republican."" “I support Trump. That’s who I’m voting for, but I don’t have ill will towards Biden,” she told the New York Post at the time."
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran. What happens next?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 2:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hamas-biden-haniyeh-assassination-rcna164747,"Although Israel has not claimed formal responsibility, it’s widely believed that it launched the operation that killed the leader of Hamas’s political wing, Ismail Haniyeh. The fact that Haniyeh was targeted wasn’t a surprise; he had been on Israel’s radar for decades and was almost killed by an Israeli strike in 2003. The surprise was that Israel reportedly targeted Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after he attended the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. In the hours since, there has been much speculation about the wider consequence of Haniyeh’s slaying. Many observers foresee a war that expands beyond Gaza, which Israel has been attacking since Oct. 7 with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after it launched an audacious attack inside Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to more than 250 being taken hostage (to date, more than 39,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there). The Biden administration is likely planning for the worst, with some U.S. officials expressing concern that Israel’s assassination of Haniyeh could undermine ongoing cease-fire talks and cause the region’s other flashpoints — the Israel-Lebanon border region, for one — to explode. For Iran, the killing of Haniyeh is, at the very least, a big embarrassment and demonstrated yet again the Iranian security services’ ineptness at securing high-profile people. Haniyeh was a frequent traveler to Tehran, meeting with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei four times since November. But on this particular occasion he was a formal dignitary at Pezeshkian’s inauguration ceremony and an official guest of the Islamic Republic. The fact that, according to The New York Times, the Israelis were able, undetected, to kill Haniyeh by planting a bomb in a room of a guesthouse that he was known to stay at — and that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had the responsibility of securing — means that the slip-ups exposed years ago when a top Iranian nuclear scientist was killed in another Israeli operation remain unresolved. So, what next? Khamenei warned Israel that it will pay a “heavy price” for killing Haniyeh and reportedly ordered a retaliatory attack against Israel. If that happens, it wouldn’t be the first time Iran has tried to strike Israel directly; in April, approximately 300 drones and missiles were launched toward Israel following an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria, which killed a top Iranian military officer. Even then, the Iranians gave advance notice of the operation in an evident attempt to mitigate the blowback. That incident showed that, Iran’s penchant for revolutionary rhetoric aside, its top leaders have shown themselves to be cautious and risk-averse during crises. It’s easy to see why: Iran has nothing to gain, and indeed has much to lose, from getting into an armed confrontation with Israel that could spiral into a war. Any Iranian retaliation therefore is likely to be limited, not indiscriminate. What about Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia? Like Iran, Hezbollah would rather avoid a full-fledged war with Israel if it can. To the casual observer, this will sound strange. After all, Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets and missiles into northern Israel since October, killing 25 people (most of them soldiers), displaced 60,000 Israelis from the area and on July 27 killed 12 children in an unjustifiable, gruesome attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Yet the vast majority of Hezbollah’s attacks have occurred in a relatively depopulated area 5 or 6 miles south of the Israel-Lebanon border. The missile fire endangers the civilians who still live there but is far less than what Hezbollah is capable of. Hezbollah has attempted to accomplish two things simultaneously: support Hamas in Gaza but avoid any military moves that could push Israel into launching a full-blown war in Lebanon. Understandably, U.S. officials remain worried, particularly after Israel killed Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander and top adviser to the group’s overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Tuesday. Hezbollah can’t be seen as complacent after receiving such a blow to its top echelons. The prospect of deeper Hezbollah strikes inside Israel and even more intense Israeli reprisals inside Lebanon aren’t inevitable but have certainly increased. If that happens, Iran would be pulled into the fray; Tehran is Hezbollah’s longtime patron and will at the least provide it additional weaponry. As for Hamas, it is struggling to survive Israel’s massive assault on Gaza and is in no position to respond to Haniyeh’s killing, save perhaps with some rocket attacks that Israel has the means to combat. Yet it’s safe to assume that Hamas will halt the cease-fire talks with Israel, at least temporarily, which John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, has already acknowledged as a possibility. Though the United States blames Hamas for the logjam, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has never been keen on a permanent cease-fire and won’t be sorry to see the talks stalled. Will Haniyeh’s death seriously damage Hamas? Unlikely. There will be no shortage of fighters ready to join Hamas’ ranks. Israel has killed several of Hamas’ senior leaders in the past, including the movement’s founder and spiritual guide, the quadriplegic Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in March 2004, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantisi the following month and Saleh al-Arouri in a drone strike in January. In November 2012, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed Ahmed al-Jabari, the de facto commander of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz-al Din al-Qassem Brigades. And were it not for a last-minute intervention by Jordan’s King Hussein in 1997, Khaled Mashaal, Hamas’ former leader, would have been on that list: Israel poisoned Mashaal in Amman, Jordan, but was forced to hand over the antidote after significant pressure from Jordan’s then-king Hussein. Hamas has survived these assassinations because it has an institutional structure that has been built up over years (the movement was founded in 1987) and solidified its influence in Gaza during its 17-year rule over the territory. Haniyeh will soon be replaced, the war in Gaza will continue, and Hamas will endure. Most headlines written after Haniyeh’s killing warn of a wider war in the Middle East, but all of the parties involved in this latest flareup also have reason to be careful."
Prime Minister Netanyahu: Make good on your promise and bring our son home,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/edan-alexander-hamas-hostage-message-netanyahu-rcna164588,"Three hundred days ago today, Hamas terrorists set fire to Israel. They burned homes, raped women, murdered more than 1,000 innocent people and took hundreds more captive. Amid the death and destruction, our son — 20-year-old Edan Alexander, an American from Tenafly, N.J. — was taken hostage. We have not heard a word from him since.   Edan is one of 120 hostages — eight of whom are American — still trapped in the darkness of Hamas captivity. It is a world governed by torture, starvation and the constant fear of death. Despite this gruesome reality, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put his personal political fortunes ahead of the release of innocent lives for nearly 10 months. In his appeal to the U.S. Congress last Wednesday, he hardly mentioned the hostages (American and Israeli) he has left behind.  In a private meeting in the White House Cabinet room last Thursday, the families of American hostages sat beside the prime minister and President Joe Biden, and we did not mince words. We demanded answers from the prime minister: We told him that enough is enough, and in response, he committed to a three-phase proposal to release the remaining hostages. He said that it would only be a matter of days before we saw action. There would be no new requirements for Hamas, no new setbacks, and soon, the ball would again be in Hamas’ court.   He not only made this promise to us, he did it in front of an audience that included Biden and national security advisor Jake Sullivan — two people we know are in our corner and who we trust to hold Netanyahu accountable. We left the meeting hopeful, but during this agonizing process of negotiations, we’ve learned to keep our optimism in check.  What now, Mr. Prime Minister? You vowed to make the hostages your priority and to waste no time in bringing them home. A week has come and gone since our meeting, and Edan is still in hell. Instead of expediting a deal, you have added new demands that you promised to avoid. So, when exactly are you going to close this deal? You came to our country — to request our government’s support — and you are still standing in the way of our son’s release. We’re grateful that you met with us. We’re even more grateful that you committed to the total and swift release of the hostages. But words are nothing until Edan is in our arms. Edan does not have the luxury of time. Israeli authorities have pronounced a third of the remaining hostages dead, with the two most recent deaths announced just last week. We cannot delay the end of the war in Gaza any longer. In Israel, Netanyahu’s own defense and intelligence officials have said so. In the U.S., both presidential candidates have called for an end to the war, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have shared their support for a hostage deal.  The world is watching where Netanyahu goes from here. He made a spectacle of coming to America. He now has Washington’s attention and the attention of more than 20 other countries that count hostages in Gaza as their own. It is time Israel’s leader shows us new solutions. We are done with the political theater, Mr. Prime Minister. We need a statesman negotiating our son’s release, not a showman. We implore you to make good on what you promised us last week, put forth a hostage deal that Hamas will accept, and devote all of your energy towards seeing it through.  "
Senate GOP derails compromise bill that included child tax credit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/senate-gop-derails-compromise-bill-included-child-tax-credit-rcna164752,"Traditionally, when Democrats and Republicans come together and forge a bipartisan compromise on a key issue, the legislative wheels on Capitol Hill start turning in a constructive way. There are, however, exceptions. NBC News reported: The vote was largely, but not entirely, along party lines: Three Senate Republicans — Missouri’s Josh Hawley, Florida’s Rick Scott, and Oklahoma’s Markwayne Mullin — voted for the measure, while two independents who caucus with Democrats — Vermont’s Bernie Sanders and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin — voted with the GOP minority. Even if Sanders and Manchin had sided with the majority, it wouldn’t have mattered: This was a procedural vote that required a 60-vote majority. (The final tally was initially 49-43, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer switched his vote for procedural reasons.) In case anyone needs a refresher, as the year got underway, Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced a breakthrough on tax policy. It appeared at the time as if both sides were prepared to get something important. For Republicans, the compromise deal included an extension of Trump-era tax breaks for businesses. For Democrats, the bill included an expansion of the child tax credit that the party has championed in recent years. In a written statement, Wyden explained after the bipartisan agreement came together: “Fifteen million kids from low-income families will be better off as a result of this plan, and given today’s miserable political climate, it’s a big deal to have this opportunity to pass pro-family policy that helps so many kids get ahead.” As we’ve discussed, this isn’t as ambitious or as generous as the original Democratic policy from 2021, but it was a plan that was poised to help millions of families. It was against this backdrop that the House voted with uncharacteristic speed, passing the deal on tax policy just a couple of weeks after it came together. The final vote in the lower chamber was 357-70 — a lopsided margin in a House that tends to be evenly divided along partisan and ideological lines. The legislation’s prospects were bright, right up until they weren’t. Senate Republicans raised a variety of objections. Some questioned the bill’s impact on the deficit; some wanted more work requirements (which already exist in the CTC policy); and others said they prefer to incorporate the relevant provisions into a larger debate next year when Trump-era tax breaks are set to expire. What’s more, some of the more candid GOP senators admitted that they simply didn’t want to give the Democratic White House an election-year victory. Whatever the Republicans’ motivations, the end result was the same. “This should be a no-brainer,” Schumer told reporters Thursday. Evidently, 43 of the New York Democrat’s colleagues disagreed. As for electoral considerations, Sen. JD Vance has spoken quite a bit lately about families and his belief that policymakers should do more to reward parents. But when it came time to vote on this extension of the child tax credit, the Ohio Republican and GOP vice presidential nominee didn’t show up for the vote and did nothing to encourage his Senate colleagues to support the bipartisan compromise. “Today, Senate Republicans voted to block a $700 average tax cut for working families with children and the construction of 200,000 homes with affordable rents—even though this bill passed the House with strong bipartisan support and comes at no cost to the federal deficit,"" White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement. ""That is a vote against giving families with children a tax cut, against reducing child poverty, against lowering rents, against fiscal responsibility, and against bipartisanship. The President and the Vice President will continue to fight for an expanded Child Tax Credit and to expand the supply of homes with affordable rents at a time when the cost of living is too high for so many Americans.”  This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Biles is the first American to nab two Olympic all-around titles and just the third woman ever to do so — the feat was last achieved by Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Biles’ first individual all-around gold came in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. Biles finished with 59.131 points after coming back from a mistake on the bars to ace the beam and floor routines. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil took silver with 57.932 points, and American teammate Sunisa Lee captured the bronze with 56.465 points. Biles and Lee were already gold medalists in Paris, with Team USA having won the women’s team final Tuesday. That win also gave Biles her eighth Olympic gold medal, making her the most decorated U.S. gymnast of all time. Andrade had won the world championships in 2022, followed by Biles taking gold in 2023.

Neil Gorsuch features in Supreme Court bid against vague drug law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 10:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/gorsuch-analogue-act-drug-supreme-court-rcna164652,"A new Supreme Court appeal spotlights one of the strangest criminal sagas prosecuted under one of the most peculiar drug laws, known as the Analogue Act. The federal law bans selling substances that are “substantially similar” to ones that have already been deemed illegal. But the vague and unscientific nature of the term “substantially similar” has led to confusion in courts. Multiple federal judges have questioned its legality, and even chemists within the Drug Enforcement Administration have disagreed about its meaning. Notably, the justice most interested in the appeal could be Donald Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch. He wrote critically of the 1986 act when he was on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. So it’s unsurprising that Charles Burton Ritchie and Benjamin Galecki name-check Gorsuch repeatedly in their petition filed Thursday, including a 10th Circuit decision in which he called the law “a curious animal,” deeming it “an open question, after all, what exactly it means for chemicals to have a ‘substantially similar’ chemical structure — or effect” and “whether terms like those will admit of fair application and afford citizens fair notice.” The Analogue Act passed in 1986 as an attempt to combat so-called designer drugs that enter the underground market faster than the government can ban them. Usually, breaking a drug law is straightforward — say, by selling cocaine or heroin, which everyone knows are illegal. By contrast, the Reagan-era act captures anything that federal prosecutors can convince a jury is “substantially similar” to an already scheduled drug. That gives the authorities a wide net, one whose ambiguous shape raises the question of whether it’s too wide for the Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee notice of what’s illegal. Ritchie and Galecki’s case gives Gorsuch the chance to weigh in from Washington, where it takes four justices to grant review. It’s unclear whether the court will do so, partly because the justices only take a relative handful of cases each term despite receiving thousands of petitions — this past term they heard about 60. But the court previously scrutinized the act in the 2015 case McFadden v. United States, before Gorsuch joined the court. In that decision, the justices unanimously put a greater burden on the government to prove analogue cases, but they left the law and its “substantially similar” standard intact. Citing remaining confusion after the McFadden ruling, Ritchie and Galecki told the high court in their petition on Thursday that there’s more work yet to do: The backstory of Ritchie and Galecki’s case is a long, strange one (I wrote a book about it, called “Bizarro,” which the petition cites). But they had a company based in Pensacola, Florida, that distributed synthetic products commonly called “spice,” seen as a cannabis alternative that some people have used to beat drug tests that would flag for the natural plant. The main ingredient in spice that gets people high is synthetic cannabinoids, which aren’t necessarily illegal; it depends on the specific chemical and there are many variations. It’s a cat-and-mouse game, with spice sellers like Ritchie and Galecki using chemicals that weren’t scheduled and shifting to new compounds as older ones were banned. One of their spice products was called “Bizarro,” named after Superman’s twisted doppelganger who was hatched in a “bizarre science experiment gone horribly wrong.” They had a Nevada warehouse that was raided in a 2012 nationwide enforcement effort called Operation Log Jam. Ritchie then made a move that a typical drug dealer wouldn’t have: He invited the DEA to their Florida headquarters. He gave an agent a tour of their operation and samples of their spice, which he knew didn’t contain scheduled chemicals because they lab-tested their products before shipping them to shops around the country. Still, Ritchie offered to shut down the business, but the agent said it looked like they were trying to comply with the law and that he couldn’t interfere with their right to commerce. Nonetheless, they were charged under the Analogue Act in 2015, years after they had left the business and embarked on careers in film and entertainment. Remarkably, they were indicted in three separate federal districts and taken to trial three times to date. Their first trial, in Virginia (one of the states they distributed to), ended with a hung jury in 2016, because jurors couldn’t reach a verdict under the Analogue Act’s vague test. The 2017 retrial almost ended the same way, but the second jury eventually found them guilty, after prodding from U.S. District Judge Raymond Jackson to decide one way or the other. He sentenced them to about three decades in prison apiece. But their convictions were overturned on appeal because the judge had wrongly blocked DEA chemist Arthur Berrier from testifying for the defense. Berrier thought the substances they sold weren’t analogues — that is, he thought they weren’t substantially similar to scheduled drugs. Obviously, that would have been damning testimony from a government expert. At the 2019 trial in Nevada leading to this Supreme Court appeal, the judge there let Berrier testify. But in another twist, the expert chemist was by then a convicted felon himself, following his arrest in a sting operation when he allegedly tried to meet an underage girl who was actually an undercover officer. So while he gave his expert testimony that contradicted the prosecution’s stance, the jury heard he was a felon who no longer worked for the DEA, clouding his testimony that could have otherwise demolished the government’s case. Ritchie and Galecki were convicted under the Analogue Act as well as a federal kingpin law that carried a 20-year minimum and life maximum. At their sentencing, U.S. District Judge Andrew Gordon stuck to the 20-year minimum and called out the Analogue Act in the process. He was troubled that while a typical dealer “clearly knows he or she is selling an illegal substance,” someone accused of selling alleged analogues “may not know he or she is breaking the law until the jury decides it is in fact an analogue.” Gordon granted Galecki, 50, compassionate release last year for health issues he faced while incarcerated and reduced his sentence to time served; the judge also granted Ritchie’s release pending appeal, meaning the 53-year-old returns to prison if they lose. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Ritchie and Galecki’s analogue and kingpin claims last year, prompting the high court bid. On top of the analogue argument — that the act is “void for vagueness” in their case — they said in their petition that their kingpin convictions are invalid because one of their alleged underlings was acquitted at the Nevada trial; they cited disagreement among the federal circuits over whether a conviction can stand in that situation. Such a “circuit split” makes the justices more likely to grant review, providing an additional (or alternative) reason for the court to take the case. The Justice Department can respond with its own brief before the court considers whether to do so.

Donald Trump loses latest gag order challenge in New York,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 9:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-gag-order-appeal-loses-new-york-rcna164697,"Donald Trump lost his latest bid to crush his New York gag order, with a state appeals court keeping the limits in place ahead of the former president’s sentencing on 34 counts of falsifying business records. After Trump’s trial ended with guilty verdicts on all counts in May, Judge Juan Merchan partially terminated the order as it pertained to trial witnesses and the jury, but kept its restrictions on speech targeting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s staff, court staff, their family members as well as family members of Bragg and Merchan. In a ruling on Thursday, the state appeals court rejected Trump’s argument that the trial’s conclusion was a change in circumstances warranting terminating the order completely prior to sentencing. “The fair administration of justice necessarily includes sentencing,” the appeals court wrote, citing the limited nature of the remaining order and noting that “threats received by District Attorney staff after the jury verdict continued to pose a significant and imminent threat.” The GOP presidential nominee is set to be sentenced Sept. 18, assuming Merchan rejects the former president’s immunity motion in a ruling due Sept. 6. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, rendered after Trump’s trial, raised questions about its effect, if any, on the so-called hush money case.

"The day after taking aim at Harris on race, Trump doubles down",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 9:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/day-taking-aim-harris-race-trump-doubles-election-2024-racism-rcna164716,"The opening salvo came unexpectedly in an unlikely setting. Donald Trump, appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention, thought it’d be a good idea to go after Vice President Kamala Harris on race. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the Republican presidential nominee said of his likely opponent on the Democratic side. “I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the former president added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded: “Is she Indian, or is she Black?” The backlash was immediate — and widespread. Even some Republicans described the GOP nominee’s racism as “embarrassing” and “awful.” An Axios report described Trump’s offensive as “a nightmare” for his party. But let’s not lose sight of the fact that Trump’s new line of attack wasn’t limited to the stage in Chicago. After the event, he used his social media platform to push a follow-up salvo. “Crazy Kamala is saying she’s Indian, not Black,” he wrote alongside a video of Harris referencing her Indian heritage. “This is a big deal.” Soon after, ahead of a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump’s political operation promoted images on a giant screen featuring headlines noting Harris’ Indian-American identity. On Thursday morning, as NBC News noted, the Republican nominee pushed the line of attack again. This, evidently, is Trump’s idea of a gotcha. So, why in the world is he doing this? I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s weird perspective, but the answer isn’t immediately obvious. It’s possible that Trump thinks he can convince Black voters that Harris isn’t Black enough. Or maybe Trump thinks it’s up to him, and not Harris, to decide how she should describe her own race and ethnicity. It’s also possible that Trump, whose lengthy record of overt racism is well documented, is genuinely confused about the very idea of someone being biracial. If Harris has celebrated her mother’s background, as far as the Republican sees it, it necessarily means she rejected her father’s background. Or maybe Trump’s brand of racism is based in part on the idea that those in communities of color get special breaks and benefits, making him uncomfortable with the idea of an opponent being able to check more than one box. Whatever the explanation, it seems like a safe bet that voters haven’t heard the last of this line of attack, even if many GOP officials would prefer to hear Trump say anything else. UPDATE (August 1, 2024, 2:26 p.m. ET): Shortly after I published this piece, Trump used his social media platform to amplify a related online item from right-wing media personality Laura Loomer, who claimed that Harris’ birth certificate ""proves"" that she's not Black."
Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion are on Kamala Harris' side — that's bad news for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 9:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-harris-beyonce-megan-thee-stallion-2024-rcna164566,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 30 episode of “The Beat.” Newly released audio of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has revealed what the vice presidential candidate really thinks about the 2024 Democratic ticket shake-up. Vance privately told donors Vice President Kamala Harris’ entrance into the race was “a little bit of a political sucker punch”: “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.” To say Harris isn’t struggling is an understatement. She is thriving. While no one knows who will win in November, Republicans can clearly see Harris’ appeal. That kind of appeal is the reason the party pushed hard at the Republican National Convention to feature anything that might feel somewhat cool or current — from Hulk Hogan to rap videos to Instagram star Amber Rose. Republicans know culture matters to voters.  But now the party now has the oldest nominee ever. While Donald Trump did have a run on television and a presence online before he entered politics, “The Apprentice” debuted 20 years ago. It’s a relic of a reality TV past. Harris, on the other hand, taps into the now and the future. That much is evident from the soundtrack of her first campaign video, which features a song from a superstar currently on music charts: Beyoncé. In the song “Freedom,” Beyoncé recounts fighting uphill battles, both personal and political: “Freedom! Where are you? ’Cause I need freedom, too! I break chains all by myself.” And while the Harris campaign’s song choice does have political appeal, this isn’t just posturing from a candidate. The vice president is a genuine, longtime Beyoncé fan, even attending a show last year in the tour’s official sparkle theme attire.  As a senator, she shouted out Beyoncé's documentary, “Homecoming,” for how it “celebrates” historically Black colleges. The feeling seems mutual. In 2020, on the eve of the election, Beyoncé posted a photo on Instagram wearing a Biden-Harris mask — broadcasting her approval of the ticket to over 300 million followers. Pop culture is a language young people speak fluently. That demographic was crucial to the winning Biden-Harris coalition in 2020. In 2024, the vice president needs their support again.  Most voters oppose fake posturing from politicians, and Harris comes across in this cultural moment honestly. She did even so before there were signs she would top the ticket.  Harris has used her platform as vice president to elevate artists and art forms Washington has long ignored. Last year, she hosted a celebration at her official residence to mark hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. The event featured artists like Lil Wayne and Jeezy.  The celebration became something of a national Rorschach test: Do you see energy, optimism and inclusion? Or do you see something else? It’s clear the Republicans want you to see something else. On Tuesday, Trump released his first attack ad on Harris, featuring video of her dancing from that 2023 hip-hop celebration — an attempt to portray the vice president as somehow less serious of a politician. But as Republicans continue their attacks on Harris, trying to see what sticks, another star has thrown her support behind the vice president: Beyoncé's fellow Houstonian Megan Thee Stallion. The rap star is no stranger to political statements. In 2021, she dropped her own anthem about women’s rights. The music video shows a Republican senator, in a MAGA-red tie, going online to hypocritically attack her in misogynistic terms. In the video, Megan confronts him for disrespecting the women who keep things running. On Tuesday, Megan Thee Stallion joined Harris for a rally in Georgia, where the star urged her fans — dubbed “Hotties” — to stand behind the vice president. A “Hot Girl Summer” for Harris, indeed. From Beyoncé to Megan Thee Stallion to Charli XCX, the vice president’s set list of support keeps growing longer and longer by the day. Can the Republican Party and Donald Trump muster anything to match it?

"Reporter Evan Gershkovich, veteran Paul Whelan released in Russia prisoner swap",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 1, 2024, 8:25 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 1, 2024, 9:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-russia-prisoner-swap-rcna164653,"Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan are among the Americans released Thursday in a prisoner swap between the United States, Russia and other countries. Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmashev, U.S. permanent resident Vladimir Kara-Murza and 12 German nationals held in Russia have also been released in exchange for eight Russian nationals who were being held in the U.S., Slovenia, Germany, Norway and Poland. Central to the deal was the release of Russian FSB Col. Vadim Krasikov, who had been serving a life sentence in Germany for the murder of a Chechen dissident in Berlin in 2019, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on a call with reporters. ""It became clear that the Russians would not agree to the release of these individuals"" if Krasikov was not included in the exchange, Sullivan said, thanking the German government. In a statement Thursday, President Joe Biden called the deal “a feat of diplomacy” and vowed to reunite “every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world” with their families. “I am grateful to our allies who stood with us throughout tough, complex negotiations to achieve this outcome — including Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey,” he added. “This is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world whom you can trust and depend upon.” A senior administration official said Biden had spoken to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in February about the swap. The official said Scholz told Biden, ""For you, I will do this."" Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 while he was on assignment in Moscow. He was found guilty of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security prison last month. Both the U.S. government and Gershkovich's employer, The Wall Street Journal, called his trial a ""sham."" Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, celebrated Gershkovich's release in a statement: ""While we waited for this momentous day, we were determined to be as loud as we could be on Evan’s behalf. We are so grateful for all the voices that were raised when his was silent. We can finally say, in unison, 'Welcome home, Evan.'"" Whelan, 54, had been serving a 16-year sentence in a Russian penal colony after being convicted of espionage in 2020. He was arrested in December 2018 while in Russia for a friend's wedding. Both men and the U.S. government have vehemently denied allegations of espionage. Negotiations in prisoner swaps between the U.S. and Russia have often been colored by political tensions. Sources told NBC News earlier this year that a deal to release Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, as well as Whelan and Gershkovich, had been in the works before Navalny died in a penal colony in February. At the time, Biden blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for Navalny's death. In 2022, while criticizing the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, former President Donald Trump said he had turned down a deal to secure Whelan's release in exchange for Bout. Whelan's family has said that Trump did little to move negotiations forward when he was president. Trump has also repeatedly claimed that he would free Gershkovich from Russian detention if he wins the November election, boasting that Putin would ""do that for me, but not for anyone else."" His remarks were widely criticized, including for potentially scuttling the possibility of Gershkovich's release prior to the U.S. election."
