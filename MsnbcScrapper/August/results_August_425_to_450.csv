"The stock market rallied, but the economy isn’t out of the woods yet",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/stock-market-federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation-rcna165210,"Though Wall Street indexes made something of a comeback Tuesday, recent days have been brutal for investors. The Dow fell more than 1,000 points Monday, following a smaller but still steep drop Friday. After hitting a record high on July 10, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 13% in less than a month. This extended drop is prompting increasing calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. And its critics have a point. The United States economy, seemingly so robust, is increasingly acting as if it’s on the precipice of an economic downturn. But the Fed, still busy fighting a battle against inflation it won well over a year ago, appears to be the last to know. The issue is less the stock market — remember, only 58% of Americans own so much as a single share — than investors’ collective wisdom about where the economy is headed. While stock market indexes have drifted lower for a few weeks, the downward trend only picked up significant speed Friday after the disappointing July jobs report. Employment growth came in at just 114,000 jobs created, well below expectations. The headline unemployment number is now 4.3%, nearly a percentage point higher than this time last year.  And for those paying attention, the jobs report wasn’t the first warning flare about the broader American economy. Most Americans’ pandemic savings ran out in March, something that hit lower-income consumers hard. Credit card delinquencies are up. Sales of McDonald’s, concert tickets and luxury goods are all faltering, suggesting flagging spending for consumers up and down the income ladder. Some recent layoff announcements have been eye-popping — last week Intel said it would cut 15,000 staffers by the end of the year — and employers feel increasingly empowered to demand remote workers return to the office. Yet the Fed is still fighting the last economic war, steadfastly refusing to cut the short-term interest rates even as inflation falls, unemployment ticks up and the economy slowly cools down. Fed Chair Jerome Powell insisted last week that inflation is still a significant threat and “we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late.” This is both wrongheaded and counterproductive. In fact, the Fed’s actions also might well be inadvertently exacerbating how we perceive inflation. Credit card interest rates are hovering near record highs, and while they aren’t included in inflation statistics, they still drain the wallets of those with revolving debt. The same is true in real estate, where high interest rates both raise the cost of monthly mortgages and reduce the supply of new homes being built, increasing housing prices.  Combine all that with the fact that Americans are still not used to the higher prices after the Covid-era inflationary surge, and it’s little wonder almost 4 in 10 Americans worry they won’t be able to pay all their bills. The question is now whether the Fed should admit it made a mistake and step in with an immediate rate cut. Wharton School professor Jeremy Siegel, best known for his bullish view of the stock market, is rarely on the same team as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. But now they are both demanding the Fed take quick emergency steps. “The jobs data is flashing red,” Warren wrote on X last week. “Powell needs to cancel his summer vacation and cut rates now — not wait 6 weeks.”  Others argue this could all be much ado about nothing and precipitous action will simply increase panic for no good reason. After all, as Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson famously observed, the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. And there are still positive economic signs. Unemployment remains low by historical standards. GDP growth is still healthy. Despite the recent stock dip, markets are up for the year, just not as up as they were three weeks ago. Moreover, there are other possible explanations for the sudden dive, including fear of a broader war in the Middle East, the popping of the artificial intelligence bubble and the impact of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates. But slowdowns and recessions don’t announce themselves. They sneak up on us — slowly but surely. The time to head a recession off is precisely when the signs are murky, and when there is still disagreement. That’s why the Fed needs to recalibrate and begin cutting rates before it is too late."
Virginia man is accused of making death threats against Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:18 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-death-threats-virginia-man-gettr-rcna165430,"A Northern Virginia man has been charged with making death threats against Kamala Harris, including in the days after she announced her run for president, federal authorities said. Frank Carillo, 66, is charged with one count of making threats against the vice president of the United States, according to the U.S. attorney’s office of the Western District of Virginia. He made his first court appearance Monday after being arrested at his Winchester home. A public defender listed in court records for Carillo did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. According to the criminal complaint, Carillo mentioned the vice president 19 times on Gettr, a right-wing social media platform, with several of the posts containing graphic descriptions of violence. Authorities said Carillo also posted violent threats against President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Phoenix-area elections official Stephen Richer — a Republican who has pushed back on election denialism. Carillo’s online posts were flagged by Richer’s Maricopa County office on July 27, and FBI agents then discovered more than 4,300 posts or replies on Gettr in which Carillo targeted public officials, according to the complaint. He also allegedly made posts threatening to kill undocumented immigrants and Muslims. Federal agents seized an AR-15 rifle, a 9 mm handgun and thousands of rounds of ammunition at Carillo’s home last week, the U.S. attorney’s office said. Violent threats against public officials have been on the rise in recent years. There were appeals for the temperature in politics to be lowered after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last month — including from the GOP presidential nominee himself — but there has been arguably little substantive change."
The Tim Walz pick is a win for economic populism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 2:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-populism-rcna165343,"Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 election. Of those who made it onto Harris’ short list, Walz seems like the sharpest choice. Walz possesses the sensibilities and accomplishments of an outspoken economic populist. It’s not only good for America when Democrats elevate economic populists to leadership positions, but it’s also an effective way to counteract the siren call of right-wing populism.  Walz’s recent legislative record as governor illustrates serious ambition for sweeping social policies designed to help ordinary Americans achieve economic freedom. In 2022 — the beginning of Walz’s second term — Democrats won a governing trifecta in Minnesota. They have used that rare opportunity to pass a remarkable list of bills based on the belief that the government is meant to serve the people. Those bills include universal free meals for schoolchildren; paid family and medical leave; free tuition to Minnesota’s public colleges for residents whose families earn less than $80,000 annually; and the biggest child tax credit in the nation. On top of this, Walz, with his signature, also enshrined the right to abortion and other reproductive health care into Minnesota law, legalized recreational marijuana, and required the state to generate all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Organized labor unions have also found much to like about Walz and his record of support for workers and unions as governor. Walz has not always been as progressive as that laundry list of policies might suggest. He made it to the governor’s mansion in 2018 in part by positioning himself as a moderate and by prevailing in the Democratic primaries over a more progressive candidate. As journalist David Perry noted for MSNBC, a lot of the recent accomplishments owe to the state’s unusual blue trifecta and effective Democratic leaders in the state House and Senate. Still, Walz deserves credit for signing those bills into law. He rightly noted in 2023 that “you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”   Before he became governor, Walz represented a rural Minnesota district in Congress and voted the way one might expect from a Democrat in red territory. He was in favor of voting for stricter screening of refugees, he took standard Democratic establishment positions on Israel policy, and once had an A rating from the Nation Rifle Association. “Walz is someone who hasn’t forged a career as a progressive or run on the left, but acts comfortable being in coalition with progressives — incl. often backing their proposals & signing them into law,” Daniel Nichanian, editor-in-chief of Bolts magazine, wrote on X. Walz’s earlier positions don’t negate his later ones. Rather, Walz demonstrates sensitivity to his constituencies and an eagerness to get things done — and clearly has some progressive instincts when opportunities present themselves.  Where Walz’s populism really shines is through, well, vibes. He grew up in rural Nebraska and likes hunting and fishing. He served in the Army National Guard for decades. He is a former social studies teacher and football coach who helped lead his team to its first state championship. He attended state schools for teaching degrees, and he is the first person on a Democratic presidential ticket since 1976 not to have attended law school. While he’s no socialist, he speaks with tremendous pride about public institutions. I was struck by how Walz recently panned Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and his allies’ animosity toward public education in an interview with The New York Times: “These guys, they talk about how evil the public schools are. For many of us, public schools were everything. That was our path. That’s the great American contribution.” While many prominent politicians seek desperately to come across as ordinary people who understand life outside elite professional urban bubbles, Walz’s life and career provide him with that knowledge organically. And Walz exudes that experience through a wholesome, happy warrior persona that has made him into a social media darling overnight. Walz’s masterstroke in the veepstakes was coining “weird” as an attack against former President Donald Trump and his extremist allies during MSNBC appearances. It has proven to be a strangely sticky thorn in the side of the GOP and serves as a rhetorical tool for denying MAGA of its claims to speak on behalf of the people. It’s been useful in dispelling the MAGA mythos and pointing out how unpopular and divisive right-wing populist doctrine is despite the everyman veneer. “Who’s asking for this crazy stuff? Who’s asking to raise the price of insulin? Who’s asking to get rid of birth control? … Who’s sitting in a bar in Racine, Wisconsin, saying, ‘You know what we really need? We need to ban “Animal Farm.”’ Nobody is!” Walz told MSNBC in July. As I’ve written before, political scientists have found that vice presidents rarely change the outcome of an election. But they’re significant because they’re the first major clue about how a presidential candidate seeks to govern. In this case, Harris has signaled that she’s interested in populism that can excite progressives and help deliver incisive messaging that undercuts the right’s claim to speak on behalf of the people. Those are promising instincts that I hope to see more of.   But perhaps the most consequential effect of this choice is that vice presidential candidates often become viable presidential candidates. There’s a very decent chance that Walz becomes a top-tier name in the party as a future presidential candidate, especially if Harris and Walz win and he handles his policy portfolio well. His emergence signals that the Democratic Party has a growing appetite for bold populism. That is in and of itself a healthy development, regardless of what happens in November."
Trump's initial response to Harris picking Walz is quite telling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 2:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-reaction-harris-walz-vp-pick-rcna165358,"Former President Donald Trump responded to Vice President Kamala Harris' selection of Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday with an uncharacteristically short statement that didn't mention the Minnesota governor by name. The GOP presidential nominee shared a cryptic post on his social media platform, Truth Social, shortly after Harris announced her pick that simply stated: ""THANK YOU!"" The typically reactionary Trump waited another roughly five hours to directly address the news: ""This is the most Radical Left duo in American history,"" the former president posted on Truth Social. ""There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again."" He went on in his 40-word missive to baselessly suggest that there is a ""BIG MOVEMENT"" to ""BRING BACK CROOKED JOE,"" an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, who withdrew his re-election bid last month amid pressure from top Democrats and donors. Trump followed that up with a longer exploration of his apparent fantasy that Biden will try to ""take back the Nomination"" when he attends the Democratic National Convention next week. ""He feels he made a historically tragic mistake by handing over the U.S. Presidency, a COUP, to the people in the World he hates most, and he wants it back, NOW!!!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. Though it seems clear Trump would rather face Biden in November, there's no indication the president is seeking to undermine Harris, whom Biden endorsed upon dropping out of the race and who formally secured the Democratic nomination on Monday. So far, Republicans appear to be struggling to come up with a cohesive line of attack against Walz, with some desperately taking shots at Walz because he created a Beyoncé Day last year ahead of her Renaissance Tour stop in Minneapolis. Others have accused the Democratic Party of being antisemitic because Harris, whose husband is Jewish, passed over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. ""No Jews allowed at the top of the Democratic Party,"" conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted on Tuesday, to which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, replied: ""News to me."" Trump will surely adopt a few talking points against Walz as the campaign goes on, but that his initial reaction was void of Walz-focused barbs and centered instead on an imagined scenario about Biden making a comeback is eyebrow-raising and, well, kind of ... weird."

What Jenna Ellis cooperating with prosecutors in Arizona’s ‘fake electors’ case means,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 2:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jenna-ellis-arizona-fake-electors-case-cooperation-rcna165359,"Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis is cooperating with Arizona authorities in the state’s “fake electors” prosecution. What are we to make of this development? To help understand it, we can look to the similar case in Georgia, in which a series of figures in Trump world were charged over efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden. When Ellis pleaded guilty in Fulton County last year, I noted that one high-profile Georgia defendant implicated by that move was Rudy Giuliani: The Arizona indictment likewise notes that Ellis “worked closely” with Giuliani. Given the state’s decision to reach a cooperation agreement, prosecutors could be satisfied that she can truthfully detail that work in a way that helps prove their case at trial; gets other defendants to plead guilty; or both. (Giuliani has pleaded not guilty, as he did in Georgia.) So, it’s more potentially ominous news for at least Giuliani, whose legal woes are legion. And beyond that? Whether Trump’s criminal exposure has increased is a natural thing to wonder about. Recall that, unlike in Georgia, Trump wasn’t charged in Arizona but rather was referenced as an unindicted alleged co-conspirator. (I explored possible reasons for the different treatment in this post.) Ultimately, it’s the Arizona prosecutors who have the best idea of how they want to use Ellis, based on their conversations with her and among themselves. What we know is that the state says it’s confident in Ellis’ value. “Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in announcing the deal. And the incentive for Ellis to cooperate is great. Unlike in Georgia, where she got a good deal in pleading guilty without receiving jail time, Arizona prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for her cooperation. In doing so, the state prosecutors noted that they could charge her again if she fails to comply with the agreement, which says that she must (among other things) “testify completely and truthfully at any time and any place requested by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, including at any state or federal grand jury proceeding, forfeiture proceeding, bond hearing, pretrial hearing, civil and criminal trial, retrial or post-trial hearing.” So it’s early yet in the Arizona case, and it could be a while longer until we know the full shape that it takes. Yet it’s possible that it proceeds more expeditiously than the Georgia case, even though that one was brought last year, because the Georgia case is currently tied up on a pretrial appeal in which the defense is seeking to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. While those aren’t the only two states prosecuting alleged schemes related to the 2020 election, the uncertain fate of the Georgia case shines an even brighter light on whatever comes in Arizona.

Trump dances for votes in awkward effort to win young supporters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 1:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-adin-ross-interview-youth-outreach-rcna165419,"As part of his campaign’s effort to woo young voters, men in particular, Donald Trump gave another cringeworthy interview to a young, right-wing video streamer on Tuesday.  Trump met with Adin Ross, who has used his popular platform to promote people like neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes and who was banned from Twitch for ""hateful conduct"" after his stream featured an unmoderated chat filled with racial slurs. The fawning Trump interview came as Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has had a surge in popularity with young voters. And Trump’s appearance with Ross came days after conservatives launched a $20 million voter outreach effort designed to mobilize young, male voters using the pro-Trump podcast “Full Send,” the Ultimate Fighting Championship and other Trump-friendly platforms.  Interviews like these appear to be part of an effort to establish an air of coolness around Trump. And it's somewhat similar to what has been done with Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s self-described “coolest dictator in the world,” who is frequently touted by MAGA Republicans these days.  So what did Trump do to attract the youngs on Tuesday? He walked out to a 50 Cent song; he called antisemitic rapper Ye a “complicated” but “really nice guy”; and he claimed rapper Young Thug (aka Jeffrey Williams) has been treated “unfairly” by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is trying a RICO case against Willams — as well as that separate RICO case against Trump you may have heard about (both Williams and Trump have pleaded not guilty). There’s ample reporting about the Trump campaign’s attempts to align itself with rappers to lure young, Black male voters, and this seemed a continuation of those dubious efforts. As I’ve written in the past, Trump has tried to use the Young Thug trial to curry favor with Black men while sowing distrust toward Willis, who he has claimed is “racist” against him. (Williams' lawyer, for the record, has rejected similarities between that trial and the 2020 election cases.) Continuing his disturbing deference to authoritarian figures, Trump praised Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for purportedly making that country “safer than our cities.” Meanwhile, Maduro is currently refusing to leave office after the opposition and outside observers challenged his claim that he won re-election late last month, sparking mass protests that Venezuelan authorities have responded to with deadly force. I wouldn’t call that “safe.” Trump also did a herky-jerky dance while telling voters he’d “keep TikTok” if elected, reaffirming his latest stance on the app, the one he appears to have taken after a right-wing billionaire investor in TikTok endorsed his campaign. (Harris, who recently launched her own TikTok account, hasn’t said whether she supports the legislation, signed by President Joe Biden, to divest the company of its Chinese ownership.) Ross also presented Trump with a Cybertruck and a Rolex watch, which might have run afoul of campaign finance rules. In all of these interactions, Trump looked like a 78-year-old candidate who is grasping at straws to seem young and hip. Trump is literally dancing for votes now. This is only the beginning of the MAGA youth voter mobilization effort. They have millions of dollars to spend, and I expect much more awkward dancing to follow. "
'Hillbilly Elegy' vs. a real hillbilly: Tim Walz is the perfect contrast to JD Vance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 1:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/walz-vance-harris-trump-ticket-contrast-rcna165405,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" With Kamala Harris’ choice to name Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, we now know who will face off against Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in November.  And the contrast between the two candidates couldn’t be any clearer. You’ve got “Hillbilly Elegy” versus a real hillbilly. The guy who went to Yale up against the guy who can teach you how to fix your car.  Walz’s personal narrative is strong and voters will take notice. Unsurprisingly, the attacks from Republicans have already started to pour in. They’re labeling the Harris-Walz ticket as radically progressive. But I’m not buying that line and neither should voters. Just look at Walz’s voting record during his time in the House. It’s far from progressive. And while some may point to his accomplishments as Minnesota governor, last time I checked feeding kids lunch and breakfast was not a progressive or conservative policy. It’s what a governor should do for the people of his state. That’s not to say there aren’t valid questions regarding Walz’s record. In 2020, the governor faced intense criticism for his slow response after protests in his state over George Floyd’s murder turned violent. But I also believe that’s something the vice president’s team took into consideration during Walz’s vetting process.  Overall, this is a strong pick from the Harris campaign. While Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was many people’s first choice — he was one of my top contenders as well — Harris’ selection of Walz shows us a preview of what kind of leader she will be in office. It shows she’s willing to go against the grain. I think that bodes well for how she may set up her administration. If this race does boil down to Harris and Walz’s “progressivism,” their competition is Trump and Vance’s MAGAism. One team wants to be an authoritarian regime, the other wants to try to govern the nation. You can talk about ideological lines all day long but, at the end of the day, the question for voters this November is clear: What will this country look like with either one of those tickets in the White House? That’s what voters have to decide. And I, for one, hope they land on the side of governing the country, not setting up a dictatorship.

"Report on Trump, Egypt, and $10 million sparks key questions",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 12:52 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/report-trump-egypt-10-million-sparks-key-questions-rcna165423,"There’s been an avalanche of news related to the presidential race lately, which may have overshadowed a Washington Post report that deserves public attention. The lede is an immediate attention-grabber: The Post’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that records indicate that four men ultimately arrived at the state-run National Bank of Egypt and carried away bags containing nearly $10 million in bundles of $100 bills. The money represented “what was then a sizable share of Egypt’s reserve of U.S. currency.” A variety of questions obviously came to the fore. Where’d the money go? What did officials linked to the Egyptian intelligence service want with roughly 200 pounds of $100 bills? According to the reporting, some FBI agents were concerned that the money was intended to go to Trump. In fact, those agents reportedly opened an investigation into whether Egypt illegally funneled $10 million in cash to the Republican for his 2016 campaign. And while that might sound like the basis for an incredible story, we’re just getting started. U.S. investigators, relying on U.S. intelligence, reportedly came to believe that Egypt’s then-president wanted to give Trump $10 million to boost his 2016 candidacy. Around the same time, Trump met with Egypt’s then-president, praising him on Fox News soon after as a “fantastic guy.” We don’t know whether Egypt gave Trump the money. We do know that a few weeks after Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi — the one who apparently wanted to give the Republican $10 million — Trump somehow produced $10 million of his own money for his campaign. It was, however, structured as a loan so Trump would get the money back. The then-GOP candidate, of course, ultimately won the election. It was during that presidential transition period, shortly before Inauguration Day 2017, when an organization linked to the Egyptian intelligence service picked up 200 pounds of $100 bills from Egypt’s state-run national bank. Soon after, Egypt’s president became one of Trump’s first foreign guests at the White House — a generous diplomatic gesture — and the then-American president ultimately released over $1 billion in military aid for Egypt. U.S. investigators never proved that the cash from that Egyptian bank went to Trump. That would’ve required access to more of Trump’s financial records, which they didn’t get. Why not? According to the Post, because then-Attorney General Bill Barr intervened to prevent FBI agents from subpoenaing Trump’s financial records. What’s more, Barr removed the relevant prosecutor — and her replacement — until the controversial A.G. finally arrived at a prosecutor who shut down the investigation altogether. Trump has denied wrongdoing, though as Rachel noted on last night’s show, he has the wherewithal to simply shut down all questions by releasing relevant financial records. To date, that hasn’t happened. A few months ago, Trump falsely accused President Joe Biden of “receiving money, for no apparent reason, from foreign countries.” Given this, it would appear that the former president has opened the door to some provocative questions from the recent past."
Tim Walz knows exactly how Republicans will attack him. And how to counter.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 12:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/minnesota-republicans-attacks-on-walz-future-gop-strategies-rcna165368,"In 2018, when then-Rep. Tim Walz was first running for governor of Minnesota, he had the blue wave of anti-Trump organizing at his back and cruised to an easy victory by over 11 points. The Republican campaign attacks weren’t particularly beyond the pale. But 2022 was different. Minnesota Republicans thought it was their turn to capitalize on what they thought was going to be a red wave. What’s more, thanks to the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising inflation and the aftermath of the George Floyd uprising in the Twin Cities, the MNGOP thought it had found wedge issues that would peel white suburban support away from Walz and take back the governor’s mansion.  Now that Vice President Kamala Harris has named Tim Walz as her running mate, national Republicans are likely to follow the same playbook as Minnesotans did in 2022. Democrats need to be ready to meet the moment. Every incumbent faced criticism over their response to the pandemic, as Covid presented challenges to which there were few answers. Minnesota Republicans fixed on two approaches — first, that Walz had abused his emergency powers in mandating masks and closing down businesses during the height of the lockdown. Second, that Walz’s lax oversight was at least partially responsible for a massive fraud in which criminals stole $250 million in pandemic relief funds intended to feed kids.  Republicans paired this with attacks blaming Walz for poor decisions during the George Floyd uprising, which they suggested had led to the destruction of property (especially a police precinct) and what they characterized as an ongoing crime wave that had turned the Twin Cities into an apocalyptic hellhole. The Republican hope was that by cloaking racism in “what about crime” rhetoric, while also blaming Walz for inflation, they could peel away key white voting demographics.  In the days before the election, the MNGOP put out a video alleging, “Since Gov. Tim Walz took office, our streets are less safe, families pay more for what they need every day, and children have fallen way behind in school.” Picturing Walz next to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (the first Muslim ever elected to the U.S. Congress, and later the first Muslim elected to a statewide office), a popular MNGOP target for racist attacks, the GOP blamed Walz for soaring prices and rising crime, and claimed the Covid lockdowns meant children were struggling in schools.  These kinds of attacks play neatly into the current rhetoric of the Trump-Vance campaign, and we’re likely to see them resurface over the next three months.  But the lessons from Minnesota offer counters to such attacks.  First of all, the Twin Cities are generally an exceptionally pleasant place to live, work and visit — are not, in, fact a hellhole. Violent crime is declining, if still too high.  The most salient criticisms of Walz come from the left — that he has, for example, been too harsh in clearing encampments for unhoused people, though even on that issue many critics acknowledge that Walz has provided much more in the way of resources to aid those experiencing homelessness.  Second, of course, is Walz himself. He’s a white, male, football coach, social studies teacher, Army veteran from downstate Minnesota — an agricultural and rural area. He’s consistently overcome — or at least limited the effectiveness of — attempts to divide the state between rural and urban, white and communities of color.  And third, he’s aggressively “normal” in an era when Republicans are aggressively weird, as Walz has been saying for months.  His opponents in 2022 were Scott Jensen, a retired doctor turned celebrity anti-vaxxer and promoter of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election, and Matt Birk, a retired NFL football player best known for questioning whether women should have careers and blaming Democrats for “playing the rape card” in the fight over reproductive freedom. It turns out that in the face of conspiracy-mongering and sexism, it’s hard to keep people focused on the price of milk and gas. Jensen and Birk were weird and off-putting. In 2022, Walz won the governorship by over 8 points. Other statewide elections were closer, but the MNGOP still hasn’t won any state contests since 2006. They’re too weird. Trump and Vance are no less weird or extreme in their policy proposals. And so as they pick up the Minnesota Republican playbook against Walz, it’s hard to believe they’re going to do any better. Or at least, clearly the Harris campaign looked into the heartland, saw a teacher, coach and veteran, and believed that he could be the next Minnesotan to serve as vice president. It’s a proud history. It hasn’t yet worked out as well when Minnesota VPs run for president, but hopefully that’s a problem we can worry about in 2032."
The Harris-Walz ticket could make history in an unexpected way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 12:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/peggy-flanagan-minnesota-first-native-american-woman-governor-rcna165380,"As a Black and Asian American woman, much has been made of the history-making potential of Kamala Harris’ candidacy for president. With her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she has teed up another prospective “first”: If the Harris-Walz ticket wins the White House, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the country’s first Native American woman to be governor. A member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, Flanagan was elected lieutenant governor in 2018 after serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives. She and Walz easily won re-election in 2022. Flanagan, 44, is the nation’s highest-ranking Native woman elected to executive office, according to her official biography. As laid out in the Minnesota Constitution, Flanagan would assume the governorship if the Democratic ticket were to win the White House, or if Walz steps down to campaign (he has not indicated that he would). On Tuesday, Flanagan congratulated Walz for becoming Harris’ running mate, writing on X: As lieutenant governor, Flanagan has been a leading voice in Minnesota for Indigenous rights. She formed the state’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office and has helped shore up relations between the state government and Minnesota’s tribal nations. Flanagan is also an outspoken advocate for abortion rights. Last month, after Iowa enacted a six-week abortion ban, she toured a Minnesota abortion clinic and welcomed out-of-state patients seeking help. “If you’re afraid, come to Minnesota,” Flanagan said. “We’ve got you.”"
"On governing experience, Tim Walz tops JD Vance (by a wide margin)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 9:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/governing-experience-tim-walz-tops-jd-vance-election-2024-trump-harris-rcna165394,"It was a little surprising last week to see Fox News’ Laura Ingraham criticize Vice President Kamala Harris for having “no experience.” There are credible lines of attack against the California Democrat, but this isn’t one of them. After all, Harris has a lengthy record of public service that spans decades, which includes stints as a prosecutor, a state attorney general, a U.S. senator and most recently nearly four years as the nation’s vice president. For voters concerned about experience, this is a bar the Democrat has easily cleared. In contrast, when Donald Trump was sworn into office in January 2017, the Republican was quite literally the least experienced president in the nation’s history. Indeed, Trump was the only American president to take office despite having no record of public service — at any time, at any level, in any capacity. By any fair measure, the television personality–turned–politician reached the White House despite knowing very little about the presidency or even how the federal government worked. But now that both major parties’ 2024 tickets are complete, we can also compare the Democratic and Republican running mates by their years of experience. Sen. JD Vance, for example, is the least experienced vice-presidential nominee for either party in nearly nine decades. The Ohio Republican did serve in the Marines for four years, but in terms of elected office, Vance has run one race — in which he badly underperformed in a red state — and arrived on Capitol Hill last year. The 40-year-old lawmaker has never passed a bill or helped lead a committee as either a chair or a ranking member. Trump and Vance combined have roughly five and a half years of governing experience. And then there’s Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz: If we widen the aperture a bit as to what should be included as part of a record of public service, it’s also worth emphasizing that Walz was a public high school social studies teacher and football coach. Or put another way, Trump picked one of the least experienced running mates in American history, and Harris picked one of the most experienced running mates in American history."
"6 things to know about Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' pick for running mate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 9:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-vice-president-pick-tim-walz-what-know-rcna165337,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was little-known outside his state until he surged to the top of Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate shortlist in recent weeks, has officially been confirmed as Harris' vice presidential pick. The 60-year-old governor's track record of winning over red-leaning voters makes him a compelling choice for the Democratic presidential ticket. Here's what to know about Harris' running mate: Born in West Point, Nebraska, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He graduated from Chadron State College in 1989. With his wife, Gwen, he moved in 1996 to Mankato, Minnesota, where he taught in a public school for more than a decade before entering politics. He also has a master's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato. Walz is the first vice presidential candidate on a Democratic ticket since 1964 who did not attend law school. Walz took up temporary teaching gigs in China and on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota before landing at Mankato West High School, where he taught geography and coached football for more than a decade. In the mid-'90s, he became the faculty adviser to the school's first gay-straight alliance — a role that Jacob Reitan, Mankato West's first openly gay student, told The Washington Post was crucial. “He set an example not just for LGTBQ students but for football players in the locker room at a time where gay people were not well understood,” Reitan said, adding that it was a sign of Walz's ability to “sell seemingly progressive ideas to seemingly not progressive crowds.” Walz was first elected to represent Minnesota's 1st Congressional District in the House in 2006, a seat he was re-elected to five times. Walz ran and won his last election for the district in 2016, the same year Donald Trump swept it by 15 points. Minnesota Democrats, fresh off gaining control of the state Legislature after the 2022 midterm elections, had a historically productive legislative session. With Walz as governor, they secured free school lunches and free college tuition for some families, codified abortion rights, enacted stricter gun violence prevention laws, expanded protections for transgender youth and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people. The Star Tribune described the 2023 session as ""one of the most consequential sessions in state history."" In the early years of his congressional career, Walz, an avid hunter, had been one of the increasingly few Democrats who received an A rating from the National Rifle Association. He began to change his tune on gun rights after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. As a candidate for Minnesota governor, he pushed for an assault weapons ban in the state and said he would no longer accept money from the NRA. Walz faced some criticism at the time, both from gun rights activists and from Democrats who questioned why he had changed his stance only while running for governor. He has credited his then-17-year-old daughter, Hope, for the shift, saying that she urged him to do more to stop gun violence after Parkland. Walz is not a national figure, but his TV appearances in the past few weeks have significantly boosted his name recognition and bolstered his case to be Harris' running mate. His interviews on cable news helped underscore his relatability and his skill as a communicator, and they endeared him to many Democrats. His most effective attack on Republicans so far?

"Like Kamala Harris, my name has been mispronounced my whole life. Here’s how I reclaimed it.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 9:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/kamala-harris-name-mispronounced-whole-life-s-reclaimed-rcna165347,"My first and last names have been mispronounced my whole life. By friends, work colleagues, and even emcees announcing me as an event’s keynote speaker to rooms of thousands. I entered my own book launch event with a huge sign outside that had both my names misspelled.  As someone of Indian-Singaporean descent and a semi-public figure, any time I’ve introduced myself to a Western audience, I’ve cringed. I know that mispronunciation and awkwardness are par for the course. I can imagine, with all of my being, what it must be like for Vice President Kamala Harris — the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — whose name has been deliberately mispronounced by her opponents in an effort to denigrate her candidacy.  And now, just to make things more complicated, I’ve decided to publicly change my last name.  I’ve made a career of creating a sense of belonging through intention, stories and action. But I’ve been hiding a secret: my last name hasn’t provided me with a sense of familial or social foundation for a long time.  In a world that doesn’t easily allow women, women of color, and those who are not public figures to change our minds, I am doing what I have said I’d never do as a feminist.  I’m changing my last name to “Malhotra” to match that of my husband and my son.  The reasons are complicated, and some of them I’m choosing to keep private. “Tulshyan” doesn’t resonate with me because it reminds me of the fraud and deceit of the man I inherited it from — my estranged father.  I didn’t make this decision lightly.  Like many professional, straight women who marry or who have become estranged from one or all members of their family of origin, I’ve wrung my hands thinking through the feminist implications of changing my name after establishing a public identity. After years of agonizing about how to distance myself from a name that’s never quite fit — literally as podcast, upon article, upon blog post published with that very last name — the decision became crystal clear as I finished the last chapter of my next book, “Uncompete: Dismantling a Competition Mindset to Unlock Liberation, Opportunity, and Peace.” In it, I write: “In order to create a world that’s better than we found it, our decisions must be guided by the legacy we want to leave. As Jonas Salk reminds us to ask: ‘Are we being good ancestors?’”  The good ancestor I’m striving to be for my 8-year-old son makes it urgent that we have the same last name. Simultaneously, I am grieving leaving my old name behind because of the bond of love I do have with the people who I once shared it with: my mother and siblings. I’ve also been reflecting on Kamala Harris, whose first name — an Indian one that means lotus — has been deliberately mispronounced time and time again, including by her colleagues at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago. Linguistics professor Darin Flynn writes that conservative media personality Tucker Carlson’s mispronunciation of Kamala is “a textbook example of a linguistic process called ‘hyperforeignization,’ where speakers go out of their way to refit foreign-looking words with pseudo-foreign speech sounds and sound patterns.” Of course, I know this too well, having experienced it firsthand in every school, college, workplace and social setting I’ve been in. As a former journalist and the author of two books with a third on the way, my name is more Google-able than average and harder to pronounce than average. Despite the accomplishments tied to it, I am changing it because I deserve a name that feels authentic to who I am and who I want to be, regardless of who it may inconvenience.  Names can help us stand out. They can help us fit in. Mine have only done the former, and just as people started to recognize my name, I’m changing it.  Our surnames often tell the world about our identity, offering clues about who we are, where we are from, our cultural background, and our family lineage. Our names reveal where we are in the human tapestry of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and — for better or worse — our families. I’ve talked about how pronouncing names correctly is a key foundation to being inclusive and anti-racist. The most commented section of a course I teach about inclusion is one where I talk openly about the shame I felt growing up with an unusual name and the path to reclaiming it. In short: I know that names really, really, really matter. Forcing people of color to change their names to be more “Western” has been part of the assimilation playbook since colonial times. Christian colonial missionaries in India, Africa and other parts of the world forced those they oppressed to change their names to become “less heathen.” The horrors of the residential boarding schools where American Indian and First Nation children were forcibly taken from their parents and coerced to “fit in,” including by adopting Western names, are well-documented.  The tradition to take on our father’s names is deeply Western and patriarchal, stemming from the 15th century when wives were considered property. Not until the 1970s did many states make it easier for a woman to keep her pre-married last name. Contrast this with other traditions, including the Khasi tribe in India, where children take their mother’s clan’s last name and women inherit land. Fluidity is common in the naming traditions of many Native American tribes, where children are given names according to their personalities. Their names can change throughout their lives to reflect their evolving identities and life circumstances. We all become more free when we think beyond the binary forced upon us and choose names that empower us. Changing my name to Malhotra feels most reflective of me, not least because of my identity as a mother of color.  My husband is a feminist and a loving role model for who I want my son to become. His name deserves to live on, more than my own father’s does. While the younger me thought it was anti-feminist to take it on, I now realize how the choice to decide either way — even if it may cause confusion — is a hard-earned privilege. If feminism is truly about choices, then this will be mine. It is a choice rooted in legacy, rather than accommodating white America with a more palatable-sounding name. That choice is something many people never experience, especially women from immigrant families. If feminism is about agency, then I’ll be honest. I wish I had more than just two choices when it comes to my last name. Western society doesn’t make it easy to build and maintain a legacy within its constraints. Having to choose only between my father’s or my husband’s name for the sake of being more easily categorized feels deeply patriarchal and unfair. I’m grateful for the support and conversations with my mother, sister and women friends. Some are instantly-identifiable authors and speakers, including some who changed their names. Each woman affirmed that I should focus on how my name made me feel and the legacy I hope to create for my son, rather than business or professional considerations.  As I work through this private struggle in public, I hope it will allow more people, particularly those like me with uncommon names, to make more authentic choices.  When I was introduced by my new name in a recent TV interview about Kamala Harris’ candidacy, it felt surreal — like they were talking about someone else.  But when I later watched the replay with my son, he pointed excitedly at the screen exclaiming, “Mum! You’re a Malhotra! Like me!”  And at that moment, it felt just right."

Don’t believe the naysayers — Tim Walz is an asset to the Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 8:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/tim-walz-kamala-harris-moderate-progressive-pick-2024-rcna165354,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate. And I, for one, think it’s a great pick. Republicans are already pushing back on Walz — trying to paint the governor as some far-left progressive. But that's just not the case. In reality, Walz grounds the vice president in a way that will really matter to voters, especially those not on the coasts. When Walz served in the House, he was elected in a very moderate district. There are many parts of Minnesota where it's not easy to get elected as a Democrat, and he represented one of them. He is much more moderate than people are giving him credit for. Although some believed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was the more moderate choice for the Democratic ticket, I challenge folks to find issues where Shapiro and Walz have major disagreements. Walz is not a coastal elite guy. He’s not an Ivy Leaguer. This is a guy who says things like, “You’d lose your hair, too, if you supervise a high school lunchroom for 20 years.” This is a guy who can give you advice on how to fix your car. He's a guy who served more than two decades in the National Guard. Tim Walz is a man who has served his country admirably. And he's going to be a real asset to the Harris campaign. What I think made the difference here is Walz's way of communicating. He is joyful when he’s on the attack. He almost does it with a wink and a smile. He has a sense of humor when he is going after these guys. And that’s what Harris needs.  She needs somebody who will keep the lightness in her campaign, somebody who will be a happy warrior — and that’s Tim Walz. He is one happy warrior, and I think he’s a terrific pick.

"Targeting Tim Walz, Team Trump flunks a test of self-awareness",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-tim-walz-team-trump-flunks-test-self-awareness-rcna165373,"No matter who Vice President Kamala Harris picked as her 2024 running mate, Donald Trump and his Republican campaign operation was prepared to go after him or her with a vengeance. In fact, it seems awfully likely that the over-the-top press statements and fundraising appeals were already written — and Team Trump was simply waiting for a name to fill in. It was against this backdrop that the former president’s campaign sent a solicitation to prospective donors this morning, telling them that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would “unleash hell on Earth” if the Democratic ticket prevails. No, seriously, that’s what the fundraising message said. But as it turns out, that’s not all the GOP nominee and his operation had to say. The Hill highlighted a written statement sent to the media from Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt: So, a few things. First, there’s nothing “dangerously liberal” about taking the climate crisis seriously. Second, it’s true that the Democratic governor restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people, but that’s a popular and just position for officials to take. But stepping back for a moment, is Donald Trump’s press secretary seriously prepared to make the case against convicted felons participating in our democracy? Because if so, Leavitt might be surprised to discover that in recent months, a jury found her boss guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. Indeed, it often seems as if the Republican Party is wholly unaware of the fact that it has a criminal leading its 2024 ticket. Trump himself recently declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” the GOP nominee said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” A little self-awareness goes a long way. The sooner Team Trump realizes that, the less embarrassing their public statements will be."
Trump targets one of the few remaining Impeachment 10 members,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 7:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-one-remaining-impeachment-10-members-rcna165365,"It was just a few days after President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid when former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan did something unusual: He became the first Republican to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 candidacy. This did not go unnoticed by the state GOP. On the contrary, the Georgia Republican Party responded to the news by launching an effort to expel Duncan from the party and ban him from ever again running as a GOP candidate. State party Chairman Josh McKoon added that Duncan will be “treated as a trespasser” if he seeks to attend any Georgia GOP event. Donald Trump — the one Sen. JD Vance said is not a “vengeful guy” — celebrated the Georgia Republican Party’s moves against Duncan, adding in an online message, “We have to purge the Party of people that go against our Candidates, and make it harder for a popular Republican President to beat the Radical Left Lunatics. Geoff Duncan is a loser who is disintegrating on his own. Congratulations to Josh McKoon for purging our Party of Misfits and people that don’t want to see us succeed!” As it turns out, Duncan isn’t the only Republican whom the former president is eager to “purge” from the party. Politico reported on one of today’s most notable congressional primaries: Though Trump usually endorses his favorite candidate in a given race, in this instance the former president endorsed both of Newhouse’s intraparty challengers: failed Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley and Jerrod Sessler, a former race car driver. (Technically, he endorsed Sessler four months ago, then told his followers a few days ago that he supports Smiley, too.) To be sure, Trump issues plenty of endorsements on a nearly daily basis, but this one stands out because of the motivation behind his campaign against the Washington incumbent. Revisiting our earlier coverage, when Trump was impeached for his role in the Jan. 6 attack, it resulted in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in American history. Against a backdrop in which Republicans seemed eager to move on from their failed, defeated president, 10 GOP House members voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the impeachment resolution, and they had every reason to believe they’d be vindicated by history. History, however, doesn’t elect members of Congress. Voters do. As the defeated, scandal-plagued, failed former president reclaimed control over the party and party leaders such as former Speaker Kevin McCarthy scurried to Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee, members of the Impeachment 10 came to realize that it didn’t matter that they were right. What mattered was that much of their radicalized political party wouldn’t tolerate their heresy, which would overshadow other parts of their careers in public service. Some saw the direction in the prevailing winds and decided to avoid the indignity of defeat. It’s why four members of the contingent — Ohio’s Anthony Gonzalez, New York’s John Katko, Illinois’ Adam Kinzinger and Michigan’s Fred Upton — announced their retirements before the 2022 primary season even began in earnest. Four more thought they could maintain the trust of the voters who’d elected them in the first place: It’s worth emphasizing for context that two of the four primary victors — Gibbs and Kent — ended up losing in the 2022 general elections, allowing Democrats to flip the seats from “red” to “blue.” As for the other two members of the Impeachment 10, California’s David Valadao narrowly won his re-election bid in 2022, while Washington’s Dan Newhouse cruised to a landslide victory two years ago. Trump has largely left Valadao alone, but the former president apparently believes Newhouse’s Washington district is conservative enough that he can help oust Newhouse, hand the nomination to an even more conservative rival, and the GOP can keep the seat. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Time will tell if Kamala Harris made the right choice by picking Tim Walz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 7:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-running-mate-pick-history-rcna164961,"Vice President Kamala Harris just made her most important decision as a presidential candidate so far: the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. The choice gave the electorate its first glimpse of her judgment on the most important matters. Typically, presidential candidates pick running mates who address a weakness or build a bridge to the wing of their party alienated by their nomination. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower selected Richard Nixon, then seen as a pugnacious conservative, after he beat the right’s hero — Ohio Sen. Robert Taft — for the Republican nomination. In 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy, from Massachusetts, chose Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, from Texas, to give his ticket geographic balance. In 1968, Nixon settled on little-known Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew, because he was not objectionable to either the liberal or the conservative wing of his party. One Nixon aide remarked that if they had programmed a computer to produce a “Vice President who would do least harm to party unity,” it would have selected Agnew. Many more prominent possibilities would have enraged one wing of the GOP or the other. As a sign of how much more rudimentary (or nonexistent) vice presidential vetting was in the pre-Watergate era, Agnew would later resign in disgrace over kickbacks he had taken as governor. As voters started to warm to outsider candidates — usually governors with zero ties to Washington — vice presidential nominees became a way to build bridges to the political establishment and add an adviser with Washington experience. That was the case when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter selected Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale (who also provided geographic balance) to join his ticket in 1976. In 1980, after negotiations to put former President Gerald Ford on his ticket failed at the last minute, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan buried the hatchet and selected his strongest primary opponent, George H.W. Bush. The choice was an olive branch to the moderate wing of the party, which had serious concerns about Reagan. Eight years later, Bush did the inverse. Conservatives had long harbored doubts that he wasn’t really one of them, so he went with the boldest choice on his short list and selected Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, a young conservative up and comer, as his No. 2. Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton discarded the common formula in 1992 when he selected Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, a fellow Southern moderate, as his ticket mate. But the 46-year-old Clinton was running on generational change against the 68-year-old Bush. And the 44-year-old Gore fit with this theme. Eight years later, Gore also discarded the standard playbook for selecting a running mate in the hopes of distancing himself from Clinton’s personal scandals. He chose the devout Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — the first Jewish vice presidential nominee. The senator had been the first Democrat on the national stage to condemn Clinton for his peccadilloes. Gore anticipated that Lieberman’s rectitude would help appeal to voters who liked Clinton’s governance and policies, but cringed at his personal behavior, as well as blunt Republican attacks over Clinton’s character. Outsider nominees looked for something else beyond D.C. connections and governing experience when trying to balance their tickets: foreign policy credentials. That was a main reason George W. Bush selected former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to be Lieberman’s opposite in 2000. Similarly, Barack Obama, who had only spent four years in the Senate, chose Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden to run with him in 2008. There is one unmistakable pattern in the history: the worst vice presidential selections have the biggest impact. There are three glaring examples. First, third-party candidate George Wallace selected retired Gen. Curtis LeMay to be his running mate in 1968. Among LeMay’s blunders: ignoring the counsel of Wallace’s staff not to discuss nuclear weapons at his introductory press conference. Instead, he declared that Americans had a “phobia” about using them even though “there are many times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons.” A few weeks later, LeMay told an audience, “There are many cases when abortion is proper.” The question, according to the general, should be left up to “the people concerned and the physicians.” He simply had no political judgment. The abortion position alienated blue-collar Northern Catholics who were essential to Wallace’s bid. The LeMay disaster was one of the main reasons that Wallace’s support dropped off significantly in the final weeks of the campaign. Four years later, South Dakota Sen. George McGovern captured the Democratic nomination by taking advantage of a new selection process that placed much greater emphasis on primaries. Yet he was an insurgent, and he didn’t have the nomination locked down until the delegates to the Democratic National Convention reversed a decision by the Credentials Committee that had stripped McGovern of some of California’s delegates. With McGovern’s staff preoccupied with the intraparty battle, they didn’t focus on choosing a running mate until the last minute. The McGovern camp, especially the candidate himself, assumed that he could eventually prevail upon his top choice — Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy — to accept the vice presidential slot. When that proved impossible, McGovern’s staff undertook a chaotic and haphazard process with an impending deadline. After several other preferred choices declined offers to join McGovern’s ticket, and Kennedy demurred again, the South Dakotan selected Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton with fairly minimal vetting. That decision erupted on McGovern when it came out that Eagleton had received shock therapy for depression on multiple occasions in the 1960s. Eighteen days after McGovern selected Eagleton, he was forced to withdraw from the ticket. In 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain needed a bold move to reset the trajectory of the campaign. He rolled the dice on little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — the first female ever on the Republican ticket. In some ways, the selection worked brilliantly: Palin became a conservative rock star, enthusing the GOP base, which was ambivalent — or worse — about McCain. But Palin’s lack of knowledge of world affairs and clear lack of capacity to run the country did damage, in large part because McCain was 72 years old, at the time considered old for the presidency. The elder Bush’s choice of Quayle in 1988 wasn’t a blunder on quite the same level. Yet the rollout of his selection was exceedingly rocky, in part due to questions over whether Quayle’s wealthy family used connections to get the senator into the National Guard during the Vietnam War. He also produced one of the more infamous debate moments in history, and his weakness prompted future President George W. Bush to counsel his father to dump Quayle from the ticket in 1992 in favor of his defense secretary: Dick Cheney. The senior Bush didn’t take that advice and lost to Clinton. What does all of this mean for Harris? The next three months will tell us whether her staff properly vetted Walz, whether choosing him was advantageous politically, or whether she made a blunder for the ages. We’ll find out soon enough."
Kamala Harris picks Tim Walz as her running mate in bid for must-win states,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:14 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 6, 2024, 7:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-picks-tim-walz-vp-running-mate-rcna164315,"Vice President Kamala Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday, a selection Democrats hope will boost the ticket's chances among white rural voters in must-win swing states. Sources familiar with Harris' thinking confirmed the decision with NBC News and other media outlets on Tuesday morning. The Harris campaign later announced her choice in a text to supporters: Harris made the final decision on Tuesday morning, hours ahead of a scheduled campaign rally in Philadelphia with her new running mate set to kick off around 5 p.m. ET, according to NBC News.  Harris' choice of Walz as her running mate could broaden the ticket's appeal: Harris as a Black, Asian woman from California with experience as a prosecutor, and Walz as a white, folksy Midwesterner with a record of enacting progressive policies. Walz, picked from a formidable pool of candidates, is by no means a national figure in the Democratic Party. But he quickly rose to the top of Harris’ VP shortlist in recent weeks as he stumped for the de facto Democratic nominee on cable news, earning wide praise for his sharp criticism of the Donald Trump-JD Vance agenda. His labeling of Republicans as “weird” also caught on fast — and has appeared to strike a nerve among some Republicans. Although Minnesota is not considered a battleground state, Democrats are hoping that Walz’s personal story and his progressive credentials can help the ticket win over voters in rural areas who have been more drawn to the GOP in recent elections. Walz's allies have touted his background and his resume as a boon to the Harris ticket. A Nebraska native, the twice-elected Minnesota governor is a military veteran and a former schoolteacher and high school football coach. He represented a traditionally red-leaning district in Minnesota in the U.S. House for 12 years before being elected governor in 2019. Since 2022, when Democrats won control of the state Legislature, Walz has passed billions in funding for schools, including free school lunches; shored up abortion rights; secured stricter gun violence prevention laws; expanded up legal protections for transgender youth; and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people. Asked recently whether his progressive record could expose the Democratic ticket to more attacks, Walz suggested he wasn't bothered by labels. ""The fact of the matter is, where you see the policies that Vice President Harris was a part of making, Democratic governors across the country executed those policies, and quality of life is higher, the economies are better, all of those things,"" he said. ""If that's what they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label."""
Why the Jan. 6 'QAnon Shaman' can get his spear and helmet back,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/qanon-shaman-spear-helmet-jan-6-rcna165223,"The so-called QAnon Shaman can get his infamous spear and helmet back, a federal judge has decided, noting that the government never sought forfeiture of the property in the Jan. 6 case.   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth began his ruling Monday by observing that, while Jacob Chansley stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, like thousands of others, he stood out to the world due to his outfit of “a horned coyote-tail headdress; red, white, and blue face paint; gloves; and no shirt,” and that he had armed himself with what the judge called a “serious weapon”: “a six-foot pole with an American flag ziptied to the shaft and a metal spearhead fixed to the top.” Since pleading guilty in September of that year, Chansley has completed his prison term. Now he wants his property back. Lamberth agreed to the return, reasoning that “the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture.” Had it sought forfeiture by now, the Reagan appointee wrote, Chansley’s motion “may have turned out differently,” but the judge saw “no reason to delay or deny Mr. Chansley relief based on the government’s hypothetical future choice to take a step it could have already taken.” Prosecutors opposed Chansley’s request because they said they wanted to be certain that the case was completely over. They pointed to the Supreme Court’s June decision in Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants — specifically, the charge of obstructing an official proceeding to which Chansley pleaded guilty. But Lamberth said it’s unclear how Chansley could challenge his conviction at this point, and that even if prosecutors need the evidence in the future for some reason, there’s “voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley’s conduct.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

"Harris taps Tim Walz, the one Democrat who checked every box",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-taps-tim-walz-democrat-running-mate-ticket-election-2024-rcna165339,"By all accounts, as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowed her search for a running mate, the Democrat had six finalists in mind. They were, in alphabetical order, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Each had an impressive resume, and each would bring real value to the party’s 2024 ticket. Buttigieg, for example, is an incredible communicator. Kelly, meanwhile, is a decorated veteran. Shapiro and Pritzker were positioned to help the ticket in the nation’s most competitive region, while Beshear has demonstrated an ability to deliver a compelling Democratic message to rural and conservative voters. Of these five, some had experience in statewide office, some had experience in Congress, and some served in the military. But only one of the six finalists checked all of those boxes, combining all of the other candidates’ best qualities — and he’s the one who’ll stand alongside Harris. NBC News reported: As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted, “Harris’ choice of Walz as her running mate could broaden the ticket’s appeal: Harris as a Black, Asian woman from California with experience as a prosecutor, and Walz as a white, folksy Midwesterner with a record of enacting progressive policies.” I can imagine there are going to be a whole lot of voters nationwide who’ll respond to the news with the same question: “Tim who?” But it’s also safe to say that those who don’t yet know the governor are going to be impressed by his story. Walz enlisted in the National Guard as a teenager and served for more than two decades, including overseas deployments. He was a high school social studies teacher and football coach. When he ran for Congress, Walz was expected to struggle in a rural district that rarely voted Democratic, but he prevailed anyway and held the seat for 12 years. He then ran two successful gubernatorial campaigns and racked up some impressive progressive policy wins. As Clarissa-Jan’s report added, “Since 2022, when Democrats won control of the state Legislature, Walz has passed billions in funding for schools, including free school lunches; shored up abortion rights; secured stricter gun violence prevention laws; expanded legal protections for transgender youth; and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.” NBC News’ report went on to note that Walz also “enacted laws expanding paid family leave, banned most non-compete agreements ... and capped the price of insulin in Minnesota (three years before Biden did it nationally).” Not too shabby. But to appreciate why Harris tapped Walz for the Democratic ticket, it’s also important to emphasize just how impressive his audition has been. The entire party just went through an intense and compressed “mini-primary” process in which a bunch of would-be vice presidents engaged in public and private campaigns. As some of Walz’s MSNBC appearances helped prove, he stood out in impressive ways, earning raves from engaged and online audiences. As for the electoral implications, Democrats have expressed confidence of late that Walz will be a valuable asset throughout the Midwest. For his part, Trump recently insisted he’s “leading” in the North Star State and expects to win Minnesota “easily.” He should probably start lowering expectations drastically."
I didn’t vote for Tim Walz originally. Now I’m completely Walz-pilled.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 12:33 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 6, 2024, 6:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-pick-minnesota-rcna164157,"UPDATE (Aug. 6, 2024, 9:17 a.m. ET): On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz to be her 2024 running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thinks the leaders of the modern Republican Party — especially but not exclusively former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — are extremely “weird.” He has been saying so for months, but ever since Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, he has become one of her most effective messengers, doing the dirty work of attacking the Republicans so Harris can focus on a positive message — “Freedom.”  It has become easy to imagine Walz as the next Democratic nominee for vice president, one of a handful of politicians who have emerged as front-runners for the honor. If it happens, I’ll be thrilled. I’m a Minnesotan and have watched Walz since he started running for governor in the 2018 election. Before that, he was just a “downstate” congressman and not so much on my radar.  But much to my surprise, I’ve become fully “Walz-pilled,” not so much because of the viral clips, but because when he has had the opportunity, he has done everything he can to make Minnesota a better place for everyone. Frankly, I’m surprised at my own enthusiasm, because I wasn’t a Walz supporter when he ran for governor in 2018. This is inside baseball for Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor politics (not technically the Democratic Party), but Walz came into the race as the more electable, more conservative major candidate for governor. He seemed fine but boring, and it felt like in the coming blue wave anti-Trump election cycle, Minnesota could do better.  So I backed his rival, Erin Murphy, and she lost. I was disappointed but naturally voted for Walz in the general election and was happy enough that he won.  But I thought Walz would be a brake on progress, seeking the kind of consensus across the middle that just isn’t possible these days thanks to the devolution of the Republicans. And the Minnesota GOP seemed especially devolved, nominating far-right ideologues instead of trying to compete in a purple state. Turns out I was wrong. Walz’s first term was fine, marked by generally solid health-related leadership during Covid and some questionable decisions during the 2020 George Floyd uprising, but it was last year that everything changed.  In the 2022 elections, Democrats won a trifecta, taking full control of state government, but with a Senate majority of only one seat. DFL leaders never hesitated, taking advantage of a large budget surplus to quickly enact a wide range of progressive policies across the board that changed our state for the better.  They made Minnesota a safe haven for the trans community. They affirmed abortion as a fundamental right and removed restrictions that limited access. They legalized recreational cannabis use and passed laws for driver’s licenses for all Minnesotans regardless of immigration status, automatic voter registration, paid family and medical leave, tax rebates for people making less than $75,000 and new climate goals, and they phased out parental fees for families with kids on Medicaid. This last one is perhaps narrower than the others, but my son has Down syndrome and is on Medicaid, so I sure paid close attention to this. Tim Walz was just one of the Democratic leaders behind the unprecedented sweep of legislation, and arguably not even the most important. House leader Melissa Hortman and Senate leader Kari Dziedzic led the way, kept their caucuses united and got the bills to Walz’s desk. But he never hesitated and quickly became the public face of the movement, especially when he was signing bills for free lunch for all Minnesota school kids, no exceptions. Long before his name was mentioned in the veepstakes, he went viral for pictures of kids hugging him and then lining up for a high-five line as Walz clowned around in the classroom. I’m less interested in the identity politics surrounding Walz, though I recognize that as a Midwestern white dad, a veteran, a former social studies teacher and football coach and a dad from a small rural town, he has a background very distinguishable from Harris’.  But there’s an advantage to this. He can argue, as he did on MSNBC, that the genuine problems facing small-town white Americans are the fault of plutocrats — the Trumps of the world, venture capitalists like JD Vance and their backers. Because the problem isn’t just that they are weird creeps, but that they’re genuinely making lives worse for more people. Walz believes Democratic policies make lives better. At the end of the 2023 legislative session, Walz gave the memorable quote “Minnesota is showing the country you don’t win elections to bank political capital — you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”  When I heard that, I became entirely Walz-pilled, delighted to be led by a politician drawing from the best Minnesota traditions of “happy warriors” like former Democratic Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey (also a former vice president) and Paul Wellstone. I’m willing to share him with the nation. Too often, including in January 2021, Democrats have held power in Washington and acted too cautiously rather than risen to the moment. The Minnesota model shows there’s another way.  Sure, Republicans howled about the lack of bipartisanship, but that’s one of the lessons. Do one progressive act or do 50, the howl will be the same. And if you help enough people, voters will reward you. There’s some Midwestern dad energy that the nation sorely needs. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign.

GOP insider: Trump’s anti-Harris messaging reflects a ‘nervous breakdown’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-nervous-breakdown-election-2024-rcna165324,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party spent two years preparing for one thing: a 2024 race against President Joe Biden. The GOP nominee and his team knew what they wanted to say, how they’d say it, when they’d say it and to whom they’d deliver the message. The former president would be an imperfect messenger who’d struggle to stay on-script, but Republicans at least had something resembling a plan. And then Biden passed the torch. To hear GOP officials and their allies tell it, they were prepared for a pivot. Those assurances weren’t true. Indeed, in the first week of the overhauled presidential race, Republicans — when they weren’t targeting Vice President Kamala Harris with racism and sexism — were reduced to focusing on her laugh, her affection for Venn diagrams and weird complaints about plastic straws. The second week was no better. One Fox News personality apparently thought it’d be a good idea to talk about the Democrat enjoying wine. Another spent some time focusing attention on Harris hugging people. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy whined, more than once, that the incumbent vice president didn’t call him during his congressional tenure to talk about his party’s non-existent policy agenda. It was difficult to imagine swing voters in battleground states hearing all of this and thinking, “Well in that case, Harris has lost my vote.” And then, of course, there’s the GOP nominee himself — who’s now referring to Harris as “Kamabla” for reasons I don’t understand — who spent much of last week questioning the vice president’s racial identity in deeply ugly ways. When that message didn’t resonate, Trump apparently decided to roll out yet another line of attack: As Politico reported, the Republican spent much of the weekend asking people to believe the vice president is an idiot. That wasn’t an exaggeration. In one online missive, the Republican nominee argued that Harris is “a LOW I.Q. INDIVIDUAL” who “can’t put two sentences together!!!” In another, Trump wrote that the vice president is “really DUMB,” “unable to speak properly without a Teleprompter” and has “an extremely Low IQ.” At this point, I could write a paragraph or two talking about how Harris is, in reality, smart. I could also add some sentences about how Mr. Let’s Inject Disinfectant Into People probably shouldn’t go around questioning others’ intellectual prowess. I could even take some time to note that if Trump genuinely believed that Harris is “dumb,” he wouldn’t be so terrified of sharing a debate stage with her. But there’s a larger point that’s also worth keeping in mind as the campaign advances: The former president is starting to look awfully desperate. Trump thought the race was effectively over after his debate with Biden, and now that the contest has changed, his anxiety about a possible defeat is pushing him toward panic. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” Election Day 2024 is three months away. Watch this space."
