"It’s not just birtherism making a comeback, so is Swift-boating",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/birtherism-swift-boating-election-2024-trump-vance-walz-military-rcna165748,"Donald Trump recently thought it would be a good idea to go after Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity and start promoting messages related to the Democrat’s birth certificate. For those familiar with the Republican’s record of racist antics, the strategy was painfully familiar: Axios described it as “Trump’s new birtherism.” But as it turns out, that’s not the only ugly tactic from the GOP’s recent past that the party’s 2024 ticket is eager to recycle. In 2004, a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, bankrolled in part by a Republican megadonor and Justice Clarence Thomas benefactor, smeared then-Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry’s military service. The deceptive operation was guided in part by a GOP consultant named Chris LaCivita. Twenty years later, LaCivita is a top member of Trump’s 2024 operation, and wouldn’t you know it, Swift-boating, like birtherism, is making a sudden comeback. NBC News reported: “What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage,” Sen. JD Vance told reporters on Wednesday. The Ohio Republican’s use of the word “garbage” rang true, but not for the reasons the vice presidential nominee probably intended. Based on all of the available evidence, this line of attack appears utterly baseless. Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard as a teenager, and his military service spanned nearly a quarter of a century. The Minnesotan served honorably, rose to the rank of command sergeant major, and retired as a master sergeant in 2005. Months after his retirement, Walz’s unit was deployed, which is apparently of interest to the Republican attack machine, but which does not appear to be controversial. In fact, Vote Vets, a progressive veterans group, published a brief summary, fact-checking the anti-Walz smear, and helping set the record straight. Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, had a related, similarly pointed message, making the case that Vance probably shouldn’t be too eager to compare his service record with Walz’s. But if the far-right senator was a poor messenger for this message, Trump was worse. The former president called Walz a “DISGRACE” by way of his social media platform, and added some related online attacks overnight. Not to put too fine a point on this, but this is a fight Cadet Bone Spurs should probably avoid. Not only did Trump avoid military service when many in his generation served, but members of his own team have told the public that the Republican has denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers” and “losers.” Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, disparaged wounded veterans, referred to soldiers missing in action as “losers,” blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, downplayed the importance of troops with traumatic brain injuries, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, “I like people that weren’t captured, okay?” If the GOP candidate thinks he can be a credible critic of Walz’s lengthy and honorable military service, he’s mistaken."
Tim Walz is the political ally trans people need and deserve,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-political-ally-lgbtq-voters-rcna165372,"Tuesday morning’s announcement that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election electrified Democrats and their allies across the country. Everyone from progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to notorious centrist Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia praised the pick, bringing long elusive unity to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket for the first time in several election cycles. One small but beleaguered voting constituency in particular breathed a sigh of relief at the choice: trans people. Trans issues have emerged as one of the primary political targets of the Republican Party, and many of the party’s legislative accomplishments over the last few years involve the systematic persecution of trans people’s rights in red-state legislatures. Because of that, Harris needed to choose someone with a track record of handling the inevitable gender identity attacks. Enter Walz. First and foremost, Walz was the creator of the “weird” attack line that has knocked Republicans on their heels over the last month of the campaign. Branding Republicans and their gender-based obsessions with pregnancy and trans people as creepy and “weird” brilliantly defuses the emotional manipulation conservatives are trying to achieve. It is, indeed, weird to be worried about children’s genitals, it is weird to obsess over Olympic athlete’s chromosomes, it is weird to criticize women for being childless (but never childless men).  But beyond being the creator of the most incisive Democratic attack line of the cycle, Walz has a deep track record of supporting LGBTQ people and pro-equality policies. As governor, he signed an executive order last year protecting trans people’s rights to access gender-affirming care in Minnesota, he signed a statewide ban on LGBTQ “conversion therapy,” and he signed a bill making his state a trans refuge state, which protects trans people and their parents from actions taken by out-of-state governments to prosecute them for accessing gender-affirming care. As a member of Congress, prior to becoming governor, Walz co-sponsored a bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, along with a bill to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy — which had prohibited openly gay people from serving in the armed forces. Outside of his official record on queer and trans issues, I’m struck by how he talks about the trans people in his state. In a time when a lot of national level Democrats are afraid to even say the word “trans” or who speak in euphemisms with vague references to allowing people “to be who they are,” Walz positions his support for trans issues as a matter of being neighborly. “We are saying to our trans loved ones, friends, neighbors, and fellow Minnesotans: you belong here,” he said in a statement after signing the aforementioned executive order. “You are safe here, and we want you in our community as your authentic selves.” It’s clear that he treats LGBTQ people with respect and dignity, worrying more about their well-being than political optics. His support for queer people even predates his time in politics. In 1999, when he was a teacher and a high school football coach, a gay student came out to him and said they wanted to start a Gay Straight Alliance at the school. Walz became the founding faculty adviser for the club. This anecdote struck me, as I was a closeted high school student myself in 1999, though I lived in liberal Massachusetts instead of Minnesota. Despite being in a very deep-blue town, we didn’t have a GSA, and “gay” was used as a synonym for “bad” back then. I vividly remember a goth boy in my school who frequently wore dresses to school and would occasionally get beaten up by football players. The idea of coming out back then was too terrifying to attempt, much less deciding to come out to the football coach. The fact that the student trusted Walz enough to do that tells me a lot about the candidate’s character and demeanor. The fact that Walz then decided to jump in and help found the school’s GSA is simply astounding to me. LGBTQ voters who care about equality across the community should be breathing a little easier at the prospect of Walz’s having a voice and a hand in the everyday operations of the White House should the ticket win this fall. As a trans person whose job it is to write about politics, I couldn’t be happier with Harris’ choice for running mate."
Tim Walz is giving MAGA a master class in manhood,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tim-walz-manhood-masculinity-trump-maga-rcna165649,"Tim Walz’s first official speech on the Democratic ticket displayed all the reasons that Kamala Harris has been lauded for picking the Minnesota governor as her running mate. Personally, I think one outshines all the rest. Walz’s military background and his work as a high school teacher and football coach, along with his palpable joy and open expressions of compassion for people in need, offer America a vision of what manhood can look like — he’s a “joyful warrior” offering a vision in contrast with what’s being offered by Donald Trump’s bravado-driven campaign. And he’s clearly willing to challenge Team Trump on that front. He displayed that even before he received the call to join Harris’ campaign, using public appearances to refer to Trump and his allies as “bullies” who are truly weak at heart and by mocking the GOP ticket for “running for He-Man Women Haters Club or something.” In his Philadelphia speech Tuesday, Walz showed he wants all the smoke with JD Vance in a vice presidential debate, saying that he’s excited for the event to happen — “that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.” That burn, a passing reference to a crude joke about Vance that spread on social media, was affirmation for me: This is a man willing and ready to challenge toxic MAGA masculinity. I don’t think I’m alone in my belief. I’ve been seeing posts on social media praising Walz for embodying a more refreshing and humane idea of manhood than anything conservatives are offering. And Harris seems to understand that, as well. In her speech introducing Walz to voters, Harris took time to lay out his “tough guy” bona fides but smartly laid out how they gave him a compassionate perspective. She mentioned that Walz is an elite marksman who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before explaining that he supports gun safety laws. She delved into his success as a high school teacher and championship-winning football coach — referring to him as “Coach Walz” multiple times — before explaining that he also thought it was important to serve as the faculty adviser for his school’s gay-straight alliance organization. She referred to his early life on a farm in the Nebraska Plains, saying their similar upbringings in middle-class families taught them the importance of “lifting people up, not knocking them down.” Harris essentially built Walz up as a kindhearted tough guy who is eager to do good. And the contrast with the Republican ticket could not be clearer. Trump has essentially built his campaign around a puerile, hypermasculine identity that’s steeped in faux machismo, violence, crassness and indifference to the oppression of marginalized groups. It’s a schoolyard bully’s concept of what a man should be. But Walz is schooling them thus far, showing Trump and Vance — and voters nationwide — that manhood can be more than a repressive drag on society."
What Josh Shapiro should do now,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 3:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-josh-shapiro-vp-pennsylvania-support-rcna165578,"Vice President Kamala Harris made an excellent choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for her running mate. The dynamic yet plain-speaking Walz brings his Midwestern roots and proven track record of progressive accomplishments to the ticket. He’s also skilled in his ability to effectively message against Republicans — a strength Democrats have sorely lacked.  Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro had been among the three finalists to fill out the Democratic ticket, and there were reports that the popular chief executive of swing-state Pennsylvania had conveyed to Harris’ team his struggle with the decision to leave his current role as governor to pursue the vice presidency. And there was pushback from a number of Democratic key constituencies — specifically, public school education advocates’ expressing concerns about Shapiro’s embrace of private school vouchers and the National Women’s Defense League’s voicing doubts about his handling of sexual harassment complaints against a former staffer.  But at Tuesday’s campaign event in Philadelphia — where Walz was introduced as Harris’ running mate — Shapiro warmed up the audience with an inspiring and booming speech in his hometown. Shapiro passionately declared that freedom was on the ballot and joined the crowd in chanting the Harris campaign slogan, “We’re not going back.”  This moment marks not an end but a potentially new beginning for Shapiro. As the Democratic Party unites behind the Harris-Walz ticket, it must leverage governors like Shapiro as invaluable surrogates. His crucial political and communication skills can amplify three key strategies: aggressively campaigning in Rust Belt states, highlighting the Biden administration’s successes and reshaping narratives about the administration’s challenges in conservative-leaning media.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee should also deploy Shapiro to key purple districts where Democrats need wins to maintain control of the House, capitalizing on his broad appeal in purple Pennsylvania.  Shapiro’s campaigning prowess is undeniable. With a 62% favorability rating in Pennsylvania and his experience defeating a pro-MAGA candidate who espoused wild conspiracy theories, his ability to cut through political noise will be invaluable. The campaign must maintain a strong presence in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — with Shapiro showcasing his success as a young, accomplished and battle-tested governor in a swing state. Furthermore, Shapiro’s top-notch communication skills are essential in today’s media landscape. A Pew Research study revealed that 86% of Americans often or sometimes get news from digital devices. Shapiro has already proven his effectiveness on platforms like “The Breakfast Club,” a popular internet radio show. While it’s important for him to appear on left-leaning podcasts like “Pod Save America,” Democrats must also engage with conservative platforms to broaden their reach. But to truly serve as an effective national surrogate, Shapiro must address his past controversies, particularly those surrounding public education.  He should highlight his support for public schools, pointing to Pennsylvania’s recent $1.1 billion increase for K-12 public education in the state’s budget — the largest single-year bump in the state’s history — while reconsidering his stance on vouchers, which, for the most part, are Republican-supported tax subsidies for existing private school families and no-strings-attached bailouts for struggling private schools. In Florida, 70% of voucher recipients were already in private schools, and some families used the tax dollars to buy big screen TVs and trips to Disney World.  Moreover, research has demonstrated that students who used vouchers to enroll in private schools performed, on average, worse than the students in the public schools they left. Public schools play a vital role in building the next generation of Americans, and if Shapiro wants to show the country he could be a leader of the future, he cannot support taking money away from the institutions that teach our children. America is great because of public schools — they bring together students of diverse backgrounds and help ensure every kid gets a quality education. Any Democrat who wants to lead the party cannot value subsidizing private education for rich people over protecting public schools for working families. Shapiro is poised to be a powerful surrogate for the Harris-Walz ticket. To be a genuine asset to the Democratic campaign, he must build on his strengths, pivot from past controversies and focus on being an exceptional campaigner. By leveraging Shapiro’s skills alongside Walz’s in Rust Belt states, Democrats can energize their big tent coalition to protect democracy and prevent the Trump-Vance ticket from taking the White House."
How Tim Walz went from an 'A' NRA rating to the gun lobby's worst nightmare,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tim-walz-nra-gun-control-evolution-2024-rcna165589,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 6 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight,"" guest hosted by Jen Psaki. In 2010, then-Rep. Tim Walz ran a radio ad for his re-election campaign, proudly declaring his support for the National Rifle Association: “Growing up, hunting taught me a lot about responsibility and respect. Lessons I hope to pass on to my kids. I’m proud to stand with the NRA to protect the rights of sportsmen and gun owners,” Walz said at the time.   That same year, not only did the NRA give Walz an “A” rating but the gun group endorsed him over his Republican challenger. And in 2016, “Guns and Ammo” Magazine named the Democrat one of the “Top 20 Politicians for Gun Owners.” Fast-forward to 2023 and here's what Walz, now serving as governor of Minnesota, had to say during his State of the State address: One month after that speech, Gov. Walz did just that: He signed a bill creating a red flag law and expanding background checks for gun owners in Minnesota. There are already plenty of articles online slamming Walz as a “political chameleon” or claiming that he made an “epic flip-flop” on guns. But that simply is not true. This change for Walz had been more than a decade in the making. In the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012 — a shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead — Walz wasn’t sure what the answer was on how to address gun violence but he told the media he wasn’t “willing to do nothing.” After the Las Vegas shooting in 2017 killed nearly 60 people and injured almost 500, Walz donated every penny he had ever received from the NRA to charity. In 2018, after the Parkland high school shooting killed 17 people and injured 17 more, Walz got a wake-up call from his own daughter, Hope. He recounted a conversation where she told him, “Dad you’re the only person I know who is in elected office, you need to stop what’s happening with this.” Walz promised to act and said he would “take [his] kick in the butt from the NRA.” Shortly after that shooting, Walz became one of the co-sponsors of the House’s assault weapons ban legislation.  He explained that decision in a video to his constituents:  ""If the question was, how do you get there? I’ve been open to it. I’ve listened. I’ve talked to people. I’ve watched people on both sides of this. But again, when I turn on my television like everybody else and this is repeated again and we’re not doing anything about it … I’ve seen enough. I’ve seen enough of this carnage.” So yes, Walz’s position on how we should address gun violence has changed over the years — it was an evolution. And I bet a heck of a lot of Americans went through that same evolution with him.  The willingness to acknowledge and change your view isn’t a weakness in a leader —  it’s a strength.

Kennedy Lindsey had a short sword, a steel tactical whip, a collapsible baton, pepper spray, a butterfly knife and a flashlight taser in her possession when a U.S. Secret Service officer searched her backpack, according to an FBI affidavit.” * NASA is apparently exploring backup options: “For weeks, NASA has downplayed problems experienced by Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft that took two astronauts to the International Space Station in June. But on Wednesday, NASA officials admitted that the problems with the spacecraft were more serious than first thought and that the astronauts may not travel home on the Boeing vehicle, after all.” See you tomorrow."
Why Trump hasn't been charged in the Arizona 2020 fake electors case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 1:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fake-electors-arizona-2020-rcna165584,"Why wasn’t Donald Trump charged in Arizona’s 2020 election-related prosecution? When the indictment came down in April, I noted some possible reasons while emphasizing that “we don’t know exactly what happened in the grand jury and what grand jurors thought of any potential charges against the former president.” We now have some insight into the state of grand jurors’ thinking: Apparently, they were interested in charging the former president. But the state wasn’t.   That revelation comes in a court filing by state prosecutors this week. Responding to the defense claim that the charges are politically biased, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes’ office noted that it asked the grand jury not to charge several Republicans, including Trump. Explaining why, the prosecution cited the U.S. Justice Department’s policy regarding overlapping charges by federal and state prosecutors. The filing excerpted the following remarks by a prosecutor to the grand jury: So, what is this DOJ policy, exactly? Known as the “Petite Policy,” it “establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion by appropriate officers of the Department of Justice in determining whether to bring a federal prosecution based on substantially the same act(s) or transactions involved in a prior state or federal proceeding.” Notably, that’s not the situation here. That is, it’s not a question of a federal prosecution following a prior state or federal one, but rather a state prosecution following a federal one. And of course, this is guidance for federal prosecutors, not for state prosecutors generally (or Arizona in particular), though it instructs federal prosecutors to consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests involved, and, if possible, to resolve all criminal liability for the acts in question.” And while Trump has been charged federally by special counsel Jack Smith, he was also charged in the related state case in Georgia. Clearly, federal policy didn’t prevent Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from bringing that indictment. The fate of both of those cases is uncertain, however, due to the Supreme Court immunity ruling’s possible implications for both prosecutions and, when it comes to the Georgia case, the pending pretrial defense challenge to disqualify Willis. Just because Trump hasn’t been charged in Arizona doesn’t mean he won’t ever be. If he becomes president again, he’ll gain the power to crush his federal election interference case. To the extent that the existence of that federal case is what’s holding Arizona prosecutors back, its disappearance could change their calculus — though, in the hypothetical scenario in which Trump is re-elected, any prosecution proceeding against him would likely have to wait until he was out of office again to get going. For now, though, as to why Trump wasn’t initially charged in Arizona, it wasn’t for lack of interest on the grand jury’s part.

Georgia’s elections board just made it easier for Trump loyalists to delay the certification of votes,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 1:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/georgia-election-board-trump-loyalists-votes-rcna165583,"On Tuesday, a Republican majority on Georgia’s State Election Board voted to change the process for certifying election results in a way that could allow Trump-supporting election deniers in key positions to dubiously cause delays. The three members who voted for the change had been praised by Donald Trump by name at his rally in Atlanta over the weekend. The changes are disturbing — and justifiably being met with outrage — given that Team Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election involved calling for state election officials to delay certification, potentially allowing the Republican-packed Supreme Court to weigh in, or even the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. It didn’t work, but Republicans have since taken control of several powerful positions overseeing local elections in battleground states, which could make a similar scheme more successful this time. Atlanta-based journalist George Chidi summed up Tuesday’s vote well for The Guardian: Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, seemed eager to downplay concerns about the change.  “Georgia’s Election Integrity Act requires counties to certify the election results by November 12th and we fully anticipate that counties will follow the law,” he wrote on X. But whether or not Republicans end up being able to use this particular mechanism to undermine democracy, Raffensperger’s assurance doesn’t change the fact that Georgia Republicans have made moves to enhance their electoral chances — and established avenues to sow chaos and potentially undermine results that don’t break their way. They’ve accomplished this by passing voter suppression laws that have created hurdles for liberal-leaning constituencies — such as Black voters and young voters; mass purges of voter rolls, largely at the behest of right-wing activists; gerrymandering districts to water down Black voters’ electoral power; and, indeed, with votes like the one we saw Tuesday. Republicans have spent years gaslighting Americans about “rigged” elections. Meanwhile, they’ve broadly done everything in their power to tip the scales come November. And Georgia is a prime example."
Bitter Trump-Vance campaign is no match for Harris-Walz joy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-tim-walz-donald-trump-campaign-rally-contrast-2024-rcna165574,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Even conservatives have been talking about Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz’s rally on Tuesday, remarking how well those two did — and the vibrancy of it all. It’s hope, optimism and joy versus the promise of retribution, anger, bitterness and division. And if you look at the candidates’ schedules, it’s also the active versus the inert. You have Harris flying out of Washington on Wednesday and heading to Wisconsin, doing an event there and then going straight to Detroit. Her schedule is busy morning, noon and night.  Here’s how Donald Trump laid out his schedule for Wednesday: “I will be interviewed tomorrow morning at 7:30 A.M. on Fox & Friends. Much to talk about. ENJOY!” The truth is, whenever Trump does go out he damages his campaign. His campaign has been very straightforward and honest about that. They want to hide him. They want to keep him from going out and talking because we see what happens when he does.  He went to Georgia and basically created a political civil war inside the Georgia Republican Party — making devastating comments, not only about Gov. Brian Kemp, but the governor’s wife, which again, is the last thing he needed to do. It’s clear this is going to be a campaign of contrast."
Trump picks a nickname for Harris that no one seems to understand,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 12:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-nickname-kamala-harris-kamabla-no-one-understands-rcna165602,"It was late Monday when Donald Trump first referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Kamabla” on his social media platform. Soon after, the former president repeated the nickname. A day later, the Republican wrote it again. And then again. And then again. And then again. At this point, readers might be asking, “What in the world does ‘Kamabla’ actually mean?” That’s certainly a common question this week, and no one seems to know the answer. That includes Team Trump surrogates. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Gov. Doug Burgum last night, “This is something I’m personally curious about. ... Do you know where [‘Kamabla’] came from, and what that nickname means?” The North Dakota Republican replied, “I can’t comment on that.” On Wednesday afternoon, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, was asked the same question. The Ohio Republican chuckled, but he didn’t answer the question. The mystery, in other words, lingers. I’ve seen a wide variety of guesses — the idea that this might be some kind of Three Dog Night reference is especially amusing — and it’s certainly possible that Trump didn’t even mean to call her “Kamabla,” but once he did, he decided to lean into the typo. But there’s also a larger context to all of this. As a New York Times report summarized: This is compelling, and coming up with a weird, gibberish-like nickname might very well have something to do with the GOP nominee’s desire to define Harris as The Other. But the whole point of derisive nicknames is to convey an obvious criticism. When Trump called Sen. Marco Rubio “Little Marco,” the phrase was intended to diminish the Floridian’s stature. When he called Sen. Ted Cruz “Lying Ted,” Trump was trying to draw attention to the Texan’s dishonesty. The meaning and purpose of the nicknames were self-evident. No one thought to wonder why in the world Trump was using these lines. The fact that the former president’s own surrogates can’t explain his sudden fixation on “Kamabla” is a timely reminder of a politician who clearly no longer has his fastball."
Harris plays it safe with Walz pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-choice-tim-walz-vp-anti-trump-republicans-rcna165596,"While it might seem lifetime ago, it’s been just over two weeks since President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris. Knowing she would be running against the clock, with a very compressed campaign schedule, Harris quickly jumped into action. In the first week, she reached out to party leaders and raised a lot of money very quickly. Then came the much tougher — and significant — task of picking a running mate. A good running mate should strengthen a ticket’s chances in key states, help win over a certain block of voters and share a policy agenda with their presidential nominee. By picking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris has opted for compatibility and a more left-leaning policy agenda. But I know for a fact that a lot of moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents are less than thrilled about it. Immediately after the Walz announcement, my phone exploded with friends, family and colleagues all saying basically the same thing: ""I was excited about Harris, and I’m still going to vote for her, but only as a vote against Trump."" In other words, this choice may not push anti-Trumpers back into the MAGA fold, but it is very disappointing. Some of the sparkle and promise is now gone. During the last couple of weeks there was a palpable buzz among moderates especially. Biden stepped down, Harris stepped up, and both Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were being floated as possible running mates. Shapiro, has been working with a Republican-controlled state Senate to get things done in Pennsylvania, and Kelly most recently supported bipartisan immigration reform legislation, an issue he has publicly disagree with his own party on. What was so appealing to moderates about these men is that they are consensus-builders; they have worked with Republicans and picking either of them would prove that Harris wasn’t going to be the progressive candidate that they feared. Polling strongly suggests that most people do not vote for a president based on their vice presidential pick. However, this decision does give voters a glimpse of what kind of leader the candidate would be if elected, and how they might govern. As governor, Walz has successfully pushed a progressive legislative agenda in his home state, and this agenda will now be used by Republicans to frame Harris as a “San Francisco Liberal.” Among the issues that Republicans will certainly try to exploit are Walz’s push to allow undocumented migrants to be eligible for driver licenses, his restoration of voting rights for felons and his passage of tough climate change regulations. A glowing endorsement from Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez will not help matters with swing voters. Although, to be fair, moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin also supports the choice. I was a senior adviser to The Lincoln Project and oversaw the day-to-day operations of Republicans and Independents for Biden. This coalition, along with other like-minded organizations, helped persuade moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents to vote for Biden, which in turn helped Biden over the finish line in 2020. So I know a fair amount about how to appeal to the sort of Republican who is desperately seeking a Trump alternative. By putting Walz on the ticket, it appears that the Harris campaign is betting that the people who voted for Trump in 2016, then flipped and voted for Biden in 2020, will either grimace and vote for Harris anyway, or just sit this election out. (And this may very well be true.) It also shows that Team Harris must still be at least a little worried about the liberal base, especially the “uncommitted” voters turned off by Biden’s support for Israel. It is likely that after the Democratic National Convention in a couple of weeks, we won’t see or hear much about Gov. Walz. It is also likely that Walz will not cause the headaches that Ohio Sen. JD Vance is already inflicting on the Trump ticket. Still, Walz is far from the bold choice that swing voters were looking for. We had hoped for better."
"Pressed on Ten Commandments displays, Louisiana governor gives bad advice",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pressed-ten-commandments-displays-louisiana-gov-gives-bad-advice-rcna165571,"Gov. Jeff Landry seems to realize that he’s created a controversy by requiring every public school classroom in the state to promote the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments. But the Louisiana Republican told reporters earlier this week, “I don’t see what the whole big fuss is about.” As NBC News reported, the first-year governor also had some related advice for families who prefer religiously-neutral public education: Whether the Louisiana Republican is aware of this or not, this is a familiar argument with an unfortunate history. Before U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the middle of the 20th century protecting the separation of church and state, it was common in many parts of the country for public schools to promote religious symbols, practices and prayers. If students and their families weren’t part of the local majority on matters of faith, they heard advice similar to what Landry offered this week. You’re part of a Jewish family in a public school that promotes Christianity? Tell your child to go wait in the hall while the rest of the class recites a Christian prayer. You’re a Catholic student in a school promoting the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments? Your parents can simply tell you to avert your eyes as the state government promotes its preferred sacred text. The far-right governor may be confused about “the whole big fuss,” but in the United States, there’s no reason to turn back the clock to an era in which public officials intervened in children’s religious upbringing, communities fought over whose religion would be favored, and kids from minority traditions were told to tolerate being treated as second-class students. The underlying principle couldn’t be simpler: It’s not the job of politicians in state government to endorse and promote the tenets of a preferred religion. Schools can and should remain neutral on matters of faith. Why Landry and his cohorts would want government officials to interfere in matters better left to families remains something of a mystery. When the Republican first created this law in June, requiring Decalogue displays in all public classrooms — from kindergarten to state-funded universities — Landry declared, “If you want to respect the rule of law, you’ve got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.” In reality, of course, if Louisiana Republicans want to respect the rule of law, they have to start with their own country’s Constitution, which includes the First Amendment, and to honor U.S. Supreme Court precedent, which GOP officials in the state have decided to ignore.

Assault weapons ruling raises possible Supreme Court guns test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 9:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/maryland-assault-weapons-ban-supreme-court-rcna165524,"The Supreme Court declined to further expand gun rights this past term in the Rahimi case, when a lopsided majority (over Justice Clarence Thomas’ dissent) upheld firearms restrictions for people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. But a new federal appeals court ruling on assault weapons could prompt another test for the justices. In that ruling on Tuesday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved Maryland’s assault weapons ban. The appeals court said the state “was well within its constitutional prerogative to legislate as it did,” despite the Supreme Court’s gun rights expansion in the 2022 Bruen ruling. The high court's Republican-appointed majority said in that decision that gun regulations can only survive Second Amendment challenges if they’re consistent with the nation’s historical traditions. “We conclude that Bruen did not mandate an abandonment of our faith in self-governance, nor did it leave the balance struck throughout our history of firearms regulation behind,” Reagan-appointed Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote for the 4th Circuit majority on Tuesday, noting that “it would have been shocking to the Framers to witness the mass shootings of our day”: “These are not our forebears’ arms, and these are not our forebears’ calamities,” Wilkinson wrote. Given that the challengers have vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court, it’s important to consider the 4th Circuit dissent, authored by Trump appointee Julius Richardson. In a lengthy writing, Richardson accused the majority of sidestepping the Second Amendment, demeaning weapons’ lawful functions and exaggerating their unlawful uses, and implausibly analyzing the nation’s historical tradition of firearms regulation. Obviously, the two opinions tell different stories with different priorities. The forthcoming Supreme Court appeal will seek to harness Richardson’s dissent to make it the law of the land. The high court has discretion over whether to take appeals, with four justices needing to agree to review them. So the first question will be whether the court wants to take up the contentious issue — and if it does, then the question, left open in the Rahimi case, will be how far a majority of the court wants to take the Second Amendment.

Rep. Cori Bush loses her primary after pro-Israel group poured millions into race to defeat her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 8:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/cori-bush-primary-wesley-bell-israel-aipac-rcna165509,"Rep. Cori Bush, a progressive Democrat and one of Congress' most vocal critics of Israel’s policies toward Palestinians and its assaults on the Gaza Strip, lost her primary Tuesday night after a pro-Israel group spent millions attacking her and boosting her opponent, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell. Bush, who was seeking a third term for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, is the second of the progressive “squad” lawmakers in the House to lose a primary after pro-Israel groups poured money into their races. More than $18 million was spent in Bush's primary, almost $9 million of which came from the United Democracy Project, a super PAC affiliated with the pro-Israel group AIPAC. Earlier this week, Bush expressed her discontent with the outsize spending by external groups. “I’m just trying to make sense of why so much money would be spent in our congressional race when our district has so many needs,” she told NBC News. In June, Rep. Jamaal Bowman also lost his New York primary to a moderate opponent backed by the United Democracy Project to the tune of almost $15 million. (My colleague Zeeshan Aleem wrote that Bowman had glaring vulnerabilities as a candidate, which the UDP successfully spotlighted.) Bush’s race was the second-most expensive primary of the cycle, behind Bowman’s. Bell will likely carry the deep-blue district in the general election. The prosecutor, who was initially running for Missouri's seat in the U.S. Senate, abandoned that campaign in October to mount a primary challenge against Bush. On the campaign trail, he sought to draw a contrast between Bush's position and his pro-Israel stance, and he pointed to her vote against the Biden infrastructure bill as an example of her failure to deliver results for her constituents. Bush's ""no"" vote on the bill was part of a pressure campaign to expand the child tax credit and a slew of other programs in the bill that she said would benefit low-income families in her district. Bush was also attacked over a Justice Department investigation into her use of campaign funds; she has denied wrongdoing and said she is cooperating with the probe. Bush suggested that she won't be leaving politics just yet. In her interview with NBC News this week, she pointed to her previous unsuccessful runs for Congress, saying, “One thing I don’t do is go away.”"
"In new suit, Musk’s X accuses advertisers of boycotting platform after Twitter takeover",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-suit-musks-x-accuses-advertisers-boycotting-platform-twitter-takeo-rcna165550,"Elon Musk’s social media platform filed a curious federal lawsuit yesterday, targeting a group of advertisers for allegedly organizing a boycott of the company formerly known as Twitter. NBC News reported: As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the conspiratorial billionaire also declared “war” against a coalition of advertisers known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). There are legal experts who can speak to this with more authority than I can, but from a layperson’s perspective, the litigation seems rather odd. People are free to ask advertisers not to support a media company. Advertisers are similarly free to buy space, or not, on the platforms of their choosing. For a social media company to sue private entities for choosing not to give it money seems like a tough sell. But as the case advances, there was one detail in the reporting that deserves a closer look. Reuters noted, “The case was filed in the Northern District of Texas and assigned to U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor.” And who is Judge Reed O’Connor? I’m glad you asked. The week before Christmas in 2018, for example, it was O’Connor who agreed to strike down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, root and branch. Even many conservatives and ACA critics agreed that the ruling was indefensible, and reactions tended to include words and phrases such as “pretty bananas,” “embarrassingly bad” and “absurd.” The New York Times noted soon after that Republicans had a habit of bringing their cases to this specific district court because of their confidence that O’Connor would give them everything they wanted: “He ruled for Texas in 2015 when it challenged an Obama administration measure extending family leave benefits to married same-sex couples. ... He also ruled for Texas in 2016, blocking the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines expanding restroom access for transgender students.” In 2022, the same judge, nominated by George W. Bush, also undermined the Navy’s vaccine requirements, ignoring generations’ worth of precedent. A year later, O’Connor took steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act again. Last month, O’Connor made headlines again, this time by blocking President Joe Biden’s administration from enforcing new anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students. It’s against this backdrop that the lawyers for Musk’s platform filed their new case in a specific Texas district where they knew the case would almost certainly be assigned to O’Connor. The tactic goes by different names. I’ve seen it referred to as “forum shopping,” “judge shopping,” “venue shopping,” and “court shopping,” but the phrases all mean the same thing: Instead of simply taking one’s chances in the judiciary, many litigants effectively try to hand-pick ideologically aligned jurists, filing their cases in specific districts in the hopes of guaranteeing success before the process even begins in earnest. I don’t know for certain whether X’s legal team tried to game the system, but it seems like quite a coincidence that they took their case to a judge who’s notorious for telling the right what it wants to hear.

Arizona’s fake electors scandal intensifies in unexpected ways,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 7:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizonas-fake-electors-scandal-intensifies-unexpected-ways-rcna165536,"In April, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes advanced the larger fake electors scandal in dramatic fashion: The Democrat worked with a grand jury to indict 18 people: 11 fake electors and seven Donald Trump aides. Nearly four months later, the larger case is advancing in some unexpected directions. On Monday, for example, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis flipped and signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, who in turn agreed to drop the pending criminal charges against her. The good news for Ellis was that she no longer had to worry about ending up behind bars, while the good news for prosecutors was that they suddenly had a cooperating witness with key insights to share about the underlying scheme. But as we discussed soon after, the question then became whether others might soon follow Ellis’ lead. Evidently, we didn’t have to wait too long for an answer. Politico reported: While the fake electors scandal has generated several dozen indictments across multiple states — a total unseen in a political scandal since the days of Watergate or Iran-Contra — the Politico report noted that Pellegrino “is the first participant in the elector scheme to accept criminal responsibility for signing the false documents.” And as dramatic a development as this is, it turns out there’s a related revelation from the same investigation that’s also raised some eyebrows. The Washington Post reported: Oh. So if this report, which hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, is correct, the former president would be facing five criminal indictments — instead of four — if members of an Arizona grand jury had their way. For those who’ve been watching this case closely, the reporting is striking, though it’s not altogether surprising. A couple of weeks after the indictments in Arizona’s fake electors case were issued, Politico reported that the grand jury’s members were “unusually aggressive” and were prepared to “cast a far wider net than state prosecutors had publicly foreshadowed.” In fact, local prosecutors weren’t inclined to indict Ellis and Republican lawyer Christina Bobb, but “the grand jury indicted them anyway.” In the indictment that reached the public in April, Trump was described as “Unindicted Coconspirator 1.” If the Post’s reporting is accurate, at least some of the grand jury was inclined to go even further."
FBI seizes GOP Rep. Andy Ogles’ phone as part of ongoing probe,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 6:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-seizes-gop-rep-andy-ogles-phone-part-ongoing-probe-rcna165527,"Last week was rather eventful for far-right Rep. Andy Ogles. On Thursday, for example, the Tennessee Republican fended off a well-funded primary challenger, leaving the incumbent well positioned to win a second term in the fall. A day later, the FBI stopped by the congressman’s home for a visit. The New York Times reported: The news was first reported by WTVF, the CBS affiliate in Nashville. While the reporting hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the congressman’s lawyer has confirmed that the FBI obtained a search warrant for Ogles’ phone, and the GOP lawmaker cooperated. The lawyer also told the Times that “it was his understanding that the search was related to allegations of financial improprieties.” For his part, the congressman himself issued a brief statement by way of social media, which read, “It has been widely reported for months that my campaign made mistakes in our initial financial filings. We have worked diligently with attorneys and reporting experts to correct the errors and ensure compliance going forward. Last Friday, the FBI took possession of my cell phone.” As regular readers know, this controversy has been percolating for several months. In fact, it was last fall when WTVF in Tennessee reported that Ogles’ finance reports showed that he’d made a $320,000 personal loan to his campaign. That was difficult to believe, since the congressman’s financial disclosures suggested he didn’t have $320,000. In May, Ogles effectively conceded that his earlier claims weren’t true. In fact, the House Freedom Caucus member filed amendments to his campaign finance reports, telling the Federal Election Commission that he actually loaned his campaign $20,000, instead of the $320,000. This, of course, led to some fairly obvious questions about the possible sources of the other $300,000. Complicating matters is that Ogles doesn’t exactly have a reservoir of credibility to draw from as he faces an FBI probe. On the contrary, he has a staggering pattern of deceptions. Indeed, Ogles is starting to resemble another House Republican who was caught lying about his background and facing FBI scrutiny over his controversial finances. His name was former Rep. George Santos. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Increasingly desperate, Trump wants Biden to return to 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/desperate-donald-trump-wants-joe-biden-return-2024-race-election-rcna165508,"As of a few weeks ago, Donald Trump was feeling quite good about the state of the 2024 presidential race. The former president was ahead in the polls; Democrats were divided; President Joe Biden was struggling; and much of the national analysis was about the expanding electoral map, as traditional “blue” states started to appear more competitive. The Republican had reason to be pleased: He was winning. Indeed, Trump’s assumptions about his inevitable victory contributed to his decision to pick an unpopular far-right running mate: As the GOP nominee saw it, he could get away with adding Sen. JD Vance to the ticket — as opposed to a qualified candidate with broader electoral appeal — because the race was effectively over. That is, until it wasn’t. Biden’s decision to pass the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris has done exactly what many Democrats expected: It overhauled the 2024 contest and put the party in a better position to win. The shift has made Trump increasingly hysterical. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico this week. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” In fact, it’s reached the point at which Trump seems to be trying to coax Biden to re-enter the race and return things to how they were when the former president was still happy. Within a few hours of Harris adding Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to the Democratic ticket, the Republican claimed by way of his social media platform, “I HEAR THERE IS A BIG MOVEMENT TO ‘BRING BACK CROOKED JOE.’” For those who pay close attention to Trump’s rhetoric, “I hear” is one of those things he says when he’s making stuff up. It’s effectively the same thing as manufactured anecdotes about big guys crying while calling him, “Sir.” About a half-hour later, the GOP candidate nevertheless published a follow-up item, pondering the possibility that Biden might “crash” the Democratic National Convention in order to “take back the Nomination.” Trump added: So, a few things. First, if anyone should avoid references to “coups,” it’s Trump. Second, the idea that Trump is privy to Biden’s private thoughts is kind of hilarious. Third, there is literally no reason to believe the incumbent president, who’s already endorsed Harris, has any interest in reversing his retirement decision, and the vice president has already secured the party’s 2024 nomination. But let’s not miss the forest for the trees: To get a sense of the Republican’s current assessment of the 2024 race, look no further than his silly efforts to get Biden to jump back into the contest, and put things back the way they were when he was still happy. A confident candidate, optimistic about the campaign’s direction, wouldn’t push such obvious nonsense. A panicking candidate, however, would. New York’s Jon Chait added, “Many of Trump’s strange public utterances have some animalistic logic to them. Whatever their lack of connection to truth, he displays dominance or caters to the desires of his audience. Here Trump is doing neither. He is fantasizing that the opponent currently tormenting him, and whom he is afraid to debate, will somehow disappear and the opponent he was defeating will somehow return.” Quite right. Whenever he’s in a jam with no obvious solution, one of Trump’s instincts is to look for someone who can make his problem go away. In this instance, he’s settled on, of all people, Biden. It’s rare to see such a pitiful display of desperation."
Glenn Youngkin downplays Trump’s mass firing plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 5:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/glenn-youngkin-trump-mass-firing-project-2025-rcna165470,"Polls show Americans are broadly worried, if not disgusted, by the idea of Project 2025, a detailed plan drafted largely by members of Donald Trump’s administration, which would fill the government with Trump loyalists and enforce draconian policies if he’s elected.  Even though the MAGA DNA in Project 2025 is clear, Trump and his campaign have publicly tried to distance themselves from it — a sign of its political toxicity. But one person who’s oddly calm about the potential damage Project 2025 could do to his state? Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. To enact Project 2025, Trump loyalists have discussed reviving an executive order he tried to enact in 2020, known as “Schedule F,” which would have stripped federal civil servants of their protections and allowed Trump to fire people for whatever reason. For the more than 140,000 federal employees who work in Virginia, such a move could have devastating implications.  But Youngkin suggested federal workers in his state would be just fine even if they are purged from their positions for political reasons or if a second Trump administration relocates entire agencies, as Trump did with varying success during his first term. According to WVTF public radio:  In a campaign video this year, Trump said, “As many as 100,000 government positions could be moved out, and I mean immediately, of Washington to places filled with patriots.” But for Youngkin to tell hundreds of thousands of federal employees, many of whom may have been working in their positions for years, that they could easily transition into these “fabulous” jobs sounds beyond naive — if not downright callous. And Virginia Democrats were quick to pounce on Youngkin for the remarks.  Virginia's governor has managed to pitch himself as a centrist and gets portrayed as a rising Republican star. But his remarks here highlight one glaring flaw: Though he can seem genial in person, that persona often feels like a cover for cruel and draconian policies."
The biggest difference between Tim Walz and JD Vance,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-rural-voters-rcna165344,"“The vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” former President Donald Trump said during his disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists last week. Trump certainly hopes that bit of conventional wisdom holds true this year. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has turned out to be an unusually poor candidate by almost any criterion, to the point where Trump can’t even bring himself to say Vance is ready to be president. The story on the other side is far different. We don’t yet know how Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will perform as he moves into the national spotlight. But in addition to putting his state out of reach, Walz could start undoing the Democratic Party’s weakness with precisely the people Vance was supposed to represent: rural voters, especially rural white voters. Only about 20% of Americans live in what the Census Bureau classifies as rural areas; most of us live in cities and suburbs. But the Republican Party’s power is built on rural votes, not only through its dominance of small rural states but by virtue of its strong support in rural areas within states, including every battleground state. As recently as Bill Clinton’s presidency, rural voters were roughly split between the parties. That’s changed in the last couple decades. Trump — a son of Queens who couldn’t have less life experience in common with the average rural resident — remains popular with rural Americans. He won 65% of rural votes in 2020 — and 71% of rural whites, up from 62% in 2016. In 2022, rural whites gave 74% of their votes to Republican House candidates, up from 64% four years before. There are many reasons for this partisan gap, but the most important is that rural whites have become convinced that Democrats aren’t like them and don’t respect them. Some would say this is all Democrats’ fault, but that ignores the relentless campaign by Republicans and the conservative media to persuade rural whites that Democrats are a bunch of snooty coastal elitists who want nothing more than to destroy rural America and everything it represents. However you apportion responsibility, the fact that Democrats are at a deep disadvantage in rural America remains. It would be lovely if Democrats could simply point out that the Biden administration has aggressively directed money to rural areas for a broad range of needs, from economic development to clean energy to broadband to infrastructure. But alas, that’s not how politics works. Democrats need messengers who can get past the skepticism — or even hostility — that so many in rural America have toward their party. Which is where Walz comes in. “He knows how to speak our language,” says Matt Hildreth, executive director of Rural Organizing, “and understands that we want elected officials who have our backs.” In the House, Walz was one of the few Democrats who won in districts Trump won handily. Not only did he grow up in rural Nebraska, as Trump might say, he is straight from central casting for the role of “Midwestern Dad.” Try to imagine Donald Trump looking happy holding a piglet. Walz also has another skill: a talent for presenting complex issues in terms that are straightforward and easy to understand. This is something that Democratic leaders, who love nothing more than a detailed policy discussion, have often lacked. He has as strong a liberal record as any governor in the country, but you’d also be hard-pressed to find a Democrat who could win more converts at an agricultural fair. The way for Democrats to regain lost ground in rural areas, Walz told Ezra Klein of The New York Times, “is with optimism and a sense of grace toward folks.” But he isn’t afraid to make a strong case against Republicans; he can stick in a shiv and do it with a smile. He is deft at dishing out strong criticism of his opponents without sounding mean or condescending. Which is exactly what Democrats need in rural areas. It isn’t enough to tell rural voters that the party they’ve been rejecting has something to offer them; they also have to be convinced that they’ve been betrayed by a GOP that offered them nothing but culture war provocation and resentment. And the truth is that the fact that Walz still looks like the football coach he once was means people are less likely to perceive him as unusually liberal. If nothing else, Walz can at least begin to change the conversation around rural politics, to force Republicans to answer for their neglect of rural America. If he can persuade rural voters to start asking the Republicans who represent them up and down the ballot, “What have you done for us lately?” it would create the conditions for some long-overdue political competition in rural America. That would help Democrats, and it would help rural people, too. For too long, they’ve been getting nothing in return for their votes. If Tim Walz can show them a different path, everybody wins. Except Donald Trump."
Trump can’t take a joke. Democrats need to use that.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jd-vance-tim-walz-weird-maga-authoritarians-rcna164669,"It’s the summer of weird Republicans. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly mentions Hannibal Lecter at his rallies, speaking about the fictional cannibal as though he were a real person. “He’s a lovely man. He’d love to have you for dinner,” must be one of the strangest things a candidate has said while trying to attract votes. Meanwhile, Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has made news with his bizarre opinions, including a 2021 remark that Americans with children should be able to vote more times in an election than their childless compatriots. Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate for president who met with Trump to discuss the possibility of dropping out of the race, admitted to dumping a bear carcass in Central Park a decade ago. (“We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,” he claimed.) “These guys are just weird,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said last week on “Morning Joe.” That label has stuck ever since, to the right’s frustration and fury. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has seized the messaging advantages of “weird,” and on Tuesday she even named Walz to the ticket. For scholars of authoritarianism, the success of “weird” is no surprise. That’s because humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics. Behind the facade of their omnipotence, most strongmen are brittle and insecure personalities. They don’t mind being called evil, but being ridiculed is a different matter. When fringe beliefs become mainstream, it’s easy to accept a political environment where the surreal and the extreme are everyday affairs. That’s how we get to Fox News host Jesse Watters telling viewers that “scientists” believe that “when a man votes for a woman, he actually transitions into a woman.” The misogyny and transgender phobia that may have inspired this proclamation are no joke, but the opportunity for satire at the ridiculous statement should not be missed. Strongmen have their own sadistic sense of humor, which is amply displayed in the awful authoritarian spectacles staged by their governments. The Nazis enjoyed making Communists who entered Dachau concentration camp in 1933, like Hans Beimler, wear signs that said “A hearty welcome!” But they cannot take a joke when they are the targets. That’s why they have to surround themselves with sycophants and lackeys, and their enablers know their prestige must be policed. When a man brought his pet rabbit named Mussolini to a bar in fascist Italy, thinking others would enjoy seeing him order it around, he was quickly arrested and served a year in confinement. Chilean graphic artist Guillo Bastías discovered the price of puncturing the leader’s personality cult with humor when the magazine Apsi published his caricature of dictator Augusto Pinochet as Louis XIV in 1987. The regime sent the magazine’s editors to jail for “extremism”: That’s how threatening humor can be as a truth-telling vehicle, in this case about how Pinochet saw the scope of his power. Satire shifts our perception of things and people, helping us to see them in a new light that is often unflattering to them. And it reminds us that what we are living through is out of the ordinary. As Bastías told me in 2018, he wanted to reassure Chileans suffering under the dictatorship that there were people who were “refusing to accept the disinformation and lies … refusing to accept the abnormal as normal.” And so we are back to “weird” as a strategy of disruption, and how thankful we can be that our democratic rights afford us freedom of speech to level such critiques at the powerful without fear of detention or worse. That is how artist Robin Bell was able to stage his projections on the front of Trump International Hotel, like a May 2017 work that read “Pay Trump Bribes Here.” While Bell worked in very different circumstances than Guillo, he, too, saw his work as a way of reminding people that “what we are experiencing is not normal.” Humor can have a crucial role in the work of mobilization and civic education to keep those democratic rights. “Laughtivism,” as Serbian democracy activist Srdja Popovic has called it, views humor as more effective than anger in highly polarized situations. When we laugh together, fear and distrust lessen, which is the opposite of what authoritarians want. That, too, is why such leaders can’t take a joke. "
Vontelle eyewear founders on why ‘your network is your net worth’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 5:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/vontelle-eyewear-founders-network-net-rcna165331,"For New York-based entrepreneurs, Nancey Harris and Tracy Green, a call from the “The Kelly Clarkson Show” resulted in a surprise trip of a lifetime that took their business to new heights.  In early 2023, the best friends and founders of Vontelle eyewear, appeared on the show to talk about their innovative eyewear company. Unbeknownst to them, “Morning Joe” co-host and Know Your Value founder, Mika Brzezinski would surprise them live on air with an invitation and tickets to join Forbes and Know Your Value’s 30/50 Summit in Abu Dhabi.   Since then, their brand has grown exponentially, and their glasses can be found in hundreds of stores across the country — from Walmart to Saks Fifth Avenue. The founders — who are both over 50 — were also recently honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s fourth annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list. “We are beyond thrilled,” Green said about making the list, saying it proves that “age is just a number. At every age, you can bring value and experience to the world.” Harris and Green said it was Forbes and Know Your Value’s four-day summit in Abu Dhabi -- and the networking opportunities with some of the world’s most powerful women -- that really changed the trajectory of their business. During the conference, Harris and Green found themselves sharing a cab with a fellow attendee. “This person and I begin a whole conversation. The next thing we know, we tell her about our glasses,” Harris explained. The attendee, who happened to be an angel investor, bonded with the women over their shared experience having trouble finding glasses that fit. Before they knew it, they became one of the founders’ first angel investors, which allowed them to make an important distribution deal with America’s Best — one of the country’s leading eyewear retailers. “If we didn’t have that money from the angel investor, it would have been tougher for us to actually get this opportunity and be successful,” said Green. “It really helped us be able to be a part of this industry in a real way.” Vontelle became the first Black women-owned eyewear company to partner with the optical retail giant. Their product is now sold in over 900 America’s Best stores nationwide. Their journey started almost five years ago, when they saw an opportunity to solve a big gap in the eyewear industry. “In 2019 I lost a pair of glasses. And I was frustrated when I went to look for a replacement pair. They all looked the same but most importantly, they were all too tight.” Green explained. “I have kind of chubby cheeks.. and they were never long enough…and when you’re frustrated what do you do you? Call your best friend to complain. I called Nancy to complain.” The two friends got to work. As they researched the eyewear industry, they found that there was hardly any diverse representation from eyewear makers. “We realized that the reason why glasses hurt for so many of our friends and family and ourselves and leaves lines on your face, and cheek indentations, is because no one who looks like us is making glasses for us. And here we are now, five years later,” Green said. The Brooklyn based eyewear company, whose vibrant designs are inspired by the African Diaspora, are made to fit diverse face shapes. Since then, the former sales and finance professionals have managed to secure ongoing partnerships with brands like Fivver and inked an exclusive licensing deal to create kid-friendly glasses for Nickelodeon. They’ve even partnered up with entertainers like actor Kadeem Hardison, to create a patent pending design of flip up glasses, inspired by his role on the show, “A Different World.” Both Green and Harris credit their success and growth on their ability to build intentional business relationships over time, and advise aspiring founders to do the same.  “Continue to network. And a ‘no’ may just be a delay to ‘yes’ later on,” said Harris. “Because people go to different brands all the time. And then or there’s turnover in companies so just keep going because one person may not have liked it, but the new person that comes on board may love it. So you just never know what somebody’s appetite may be at that particular time. And just remember your network is your net worth. It’s very powerful.” Daniela Pierre-Bravo is a journalist, author, and founder of Acceso Community — a mentorship program for professional women. She is the co-author of “Earn It” with Mika Brzezinski. Her solo book, “’The Other: How to Own Your Power at Work as a Woman of Color,” is out now.

The U.S. can’t figure out how to actually help Venezuela’s opposition,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 4:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/venezuela-election-us-policy-reaction-rcna165448,"More than a week after millions of Venezuelans went to the polls to pick their new president, the autocrat Nicolás Maduro remains ensconced in the Miraflores presidential palace, despite evidence that he lost the election to his opponent Edmundo González. Shortly after the voting ended, the government-dominated National Electoral Council (NEC) announced that Maduro was the winner and that he had beat opposition candidate González by seven percentage points. The only problem: the NEC has yet to release any of the detailed data to the public in what is shaping up to be the most transparent election fraud in the history of Latin America. Maduro’s political opponents were able to acquire more than 80% of the vote tally sheets from the thousands of polling stations dotting the country. Those numbers paint a strikingly different picture, showing González demolishing Maduro by an astounding 35 percentage points. The Washington Post did its own calculations and found that, of the 23,270 tally sheets received from the opposition, González won with about 67% of the vote to Maduro’s paltry 30%. The numbers were so lopsided that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement on Aug. 1 declaring Gonzalez the indisputable victor: “Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people, that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s July 28 presidential election.” The Americans weren’t the only ones — the European Union, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Panama and others have either questioned the results given by Maduro’s administration or called Venezuela’s latest election a sham. Now, U.S. policymakers are likely asking themselves some big questions. Can Maduro be pushed out, and if so, how and at what price? If not, is there a way to at least convince Maduro to establish a national unity government? Should Washington step aside and allow Latin America’s heavyweights like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia to take ownership of the issue? And is the stream of migration out of Venezuela — nearly 8 million have left over the last decade — bound to get worse?    Maduro, who has ruled Venezuela since 2013 after taking over from his mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, is no stranger to election shenanigans. The 2013 and 2018 presidential elections as well as the 2017 constituent assembly elections were all viewed in one way or another as laced with fraud or skewed to the government’s favor. Maduro has used the machinery of government to ice out opposition candidates, barring some from public life while arresting others. Popular opposition figure Maria Corina Machado was banned from running this year, forcing her to name a replacement in Gonzalez, a mild-mannered former diplomat who had virtually no national name recognition.  In the days since the election, Maduro hasn’t wavered. He held a giant rally over the weekend to brag about his victory. He blasted his opponents as fascists, criminals, coup-plotters and lackeys of the great imperial beast to the north, the United States. He’s done more than talk: approximately 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested so far; Venezuelan diplomats from seven Latin American countries who disputed Maduro’s victory were ordered back to Caracas; direct flights to Panama, the Dominican Republic and Peru were cancelled; and Maduro has called on ordinary Venezuelans to use a government-built app to report anti-government protests.  None of this is surprising. We knew, for instance, that Maduro would use all of the power at his disposal to extend his presidency for another six years. We knew the Venezuelan opposition movement would react harshly to yet another stolen election. We knew Washington and its allies and partners in Europe and Latin America would raise concerns about the voting procedures. And we even knew that Maduro would have a very tough chance winning a third term in a free and open election.  What we don’t know, however, is whether the U.S. can do anything to dislodge Maduro from power or whether any policy from Washington would fix the situation Venezuela currently finds itself in. The answer if recent history is any guide would appear to be “no.” For the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, Maduro’s Venezuela is the very definition of an intractable foreign policy problem with no clear-cut solutions. Everything the U.S. has tried over the last decade has failed. U.S. policy took a slightly more hawkish turn under Obama, who despite shaking hands with Chavez during an April 2009 regional summit — Chavez famously said he wanted to be friends with Obama — found the Venezuelan socialist as ornery during his term as he was during his predecessor George W. Bush’s. In 2010, Washington revoked the visa of Venezuela’s ambassador in retaliation for Caracas refusing to accept Obama’s ambassadorial nominee to the country. It only took a turn for the worst when Maduro, who succeeded Chavez after his death from cancer, took a heavy hand against demonstrators and pro-democracy advocates during protests in 2015, stripped opposition lawmakers from their committee posts and kicked out a foreign cable news network. Sanctions soon became the core tool of U.S. policy on Venezuela, with Congress passing a sanctions law in 2014 and Obama issuing an executive order months later to freeze the assets of any Venezuelan official complicit in acts of violence against civilians, restrictions on freedom of the press and public corruption. The actions were at best symbolic, a way to show Latin America that Washington was doing something. The sanctions regime accelerated rapidly under former President Donald Trump, when U.S.-Venezuela relations were in purgatory for Trump’s four years in office. Washington prevented U.S. oil companies from operating in Venezuela or selling Venezuelan oil. Any third-party country who imported Venezuelan oil, the lifeblood of Maduro’s economy, exposed themselves to being locked out of the U.S. financial system. Venezuelan government property and assets in the U.S. were seized and handed over to Juan Guaido, the leader of the National Assembly whom the Trump administration and dozens of other countries recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state in January 2019. Between 2015 and 2020, Venezuela’s oil exports declined by approximately 80%, from 2.4 million barrels a day to 500,000 barrels a day.  This maximum-pressure policy was trumpeted by U.S. officials whose braggadocio and confidence would ultimately prove short-lived. Former national security adviser John Bolton (who claimed that the sanctions would end “Maduro’s tyrannical reign”) and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (who asserted Maduro’s government was on its last legs) would later attempt to explain why they were both wrong (they still haven’t been able to). So did Guaido, whose attempted uprising against Maduro’s government in April 2019 unraveled in a day after the Venezuelan military stuck with Maduro. The Venezuelan people were the ultimate losers in this situation, forced to live with a cratering economy hemmed in by U.S. sanctions, an ever-repressive Venezuelan security apparatus and a man in Maduro whose power at the top of the system was more consolidated than ever before. Biden came into office in 2021 knowing Trump’s maximum pressure strategy was a failure. Yet he didn’t ditch it entirely. Rather, he tailored the pressure with backchannel diplomacy in the hope that offers of U.S. financial relief would incentivize Caracas to meet U.S. demands. In October 2022, the U.S. and Venezuela struck a prisoner exchange, trading two nephews of Maduro’s wife (who were convicted in a U.S. court on drug trafficking charges) for seven Americans imprisoned in Venezuela. Weeks later, U.S. oil company Chevron was allowed to expand production in Venezuela in an effort to keep the political dialogue between Maduro and the opposition afloat. And a year later, Washington temporarily eased sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry after Maduro signed an accord with the opposition setting some rules of the game for a free and fair upcoming presidential election. The idea: to sweeten Maduro’s appetite and give him a sample of the economic goodies on offer if he stopped jailing his opponents and rigging elections. Of course, this strategy didn’t work either. Washington re-imposed the oil sanctions in April, a consequence of ex-communicating Machado from political office for the next 15 years, preventing the European Union’s election monitors from entering the country and monopolizing coverage on the airways. The free and fair election the U.S. and Venezuela’s neighbors hoped for was anything but.  How will the U.S. react in the weeks and months ahead? Likely, the response is already baked-in: more sanctions, more diplomatic finger-waiving, perhaps building an international coalition to ensure the opposition survives to fight another day. Just don’t expect any of it to work. "
Musk joins Jim Jordan's war on free enterprise with new lawsuit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 6, 2024, 3:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/elon-musk-lawsuit-jim-jordan-war-advertisers-rcna165447,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the seemingly all-inclusive world of technology. Elon Musk is propelling House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan’s war on private enterprise. On Tuesday, Musk announced a lawsuit and, in a post on X, declared ""war"" against a coalition of advertisers known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), which uses its collective power to prioritize investing in companies that align with what they feel are issues of import. Jordan previously used his role as Judiciary chairman to accuse companies in GARM of illegally colluding against conservatives over their choice not to advertise on some controversial conservative platforms. Musk’s lawsuit cites Jordan’s investigations, and in posts online he claimed companies could be guilty of racketeering for choosing not to advertise on X after he took over, which was a period in which advertisers fled from X due to the platform being rife with hate speech.

Multiple outlets had already discovered various security issues with the platform that exposed voters’ private information, and the ProPublica discovery found a flaw that made it easier for users of the platform to cancel other people’s voter registrations. Georgia Republicans have expanded opportunities for people to purge purportedly ineligible voters from the voter rolls, and in their rush to do so, they’ve clearly overlooked flaws in the process that could leave eligible voters disenfranchised.
