Time is money and Joe Biden’s trying to help Americans waste less of both,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-business-policy-election-2024-time-is-money-rcna166397,"The first half of President Joe Biden’s term was focused on doing big things. His initial plans out of the gate, compiled in the “Build Back Better” agenda, were sweeping and transformative. The legislation that was spun out of that package — including the Inflation Reduction Act, the massive infrastructure bill and the CHIPS and Science Act — were major investments in the country’s future. Now though, as we approach the final few months of what will be his single term, Biden is going smaller. At first glance, the “Time Is Money” initiative that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced Monday could be seen as relatively insignificant. But in this case, smaller doesn’t mean less important or impactful. In fact, in setting his White House’s sights on the ways corporations sap Americans’ time and money, Biden is making an argument that there’s plenty the federal government can do to improve the way we live. The new effort from the Biden-Harris administration is focused on “the corporate practice of giving people the run around, wasting their precious time and money,” according to the White House’s fact sheet. In particular, the aim is tackling the seemingly minor inconveniences that add up to major hassle at the expense of consumers: Accordingly, the Biden administration is pulling what levers it can to combat this scourge — or at least getting the ball rolling. Given how long it generally takes for a proposed federal rule to go from concept to policy, many of the changes listed won’t be felt until after the election. By the same token, though, it’s important that the process to get these rules into place begin sooner rather than later. The only finalized policy among those listed as part of the “Time Is Money” initiative is the Transportation Department’s much-lauded (and promoted) rule that requires airlines to provide automatic refunds for canceled flights. Next furthest along are the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed rules that would require that companies make it as easy to cancel a subscription as it is to sign up for one. The FTC is reviewing public comments on that proposed rule. Another proposed rule from the FTC would “stop marketers from using illicit review and endorsement practices such as using fake reviews, suppressing honest negative reviews, and paying for positive reviews,” which would make online shopping much easier after years of decline. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has two rules in the works. One would cut back on the “doom loops” that force callers to listen to long messages before they reach an actual human being. The other would limit how banks and other corporations use chatbots and artificial intelligence voice recordings to give users the runaround. The remaining policies listed are more requests than rules, including a call from the Department of Health and Human Services to have health insurance providers make the process to submit claims far less cumbersome. This is exactly the kind of executive action that you’d expect from a president looking to get things done while Congress is deep in campaign season. Without the ability to pass major new legislation, the executive branch must get creative with its powers to get anything new done. These time-wasters are also a (literally) rich target for Biden politically, as you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t had gripes about them. It also brings to mind Biden’s calling out companies for “shrinkflation” and the perennial call for the government to tackle the out-of-control number of spam calls reaching our phones. Beyond the consumer protection side of things, I’d argue there’s a worker protection component to these policies, as well. All too often it’s the customer service worker following company policy who bears the brunt of consumer ire. In leveraging the government’s weight against these businesses, Biden is both providing a more equal playing field for purchasers and acting as a relief valve for those workers. The one concern I have is that congressional Republicans could raise a fuss if they wanted to push back on any of these rules. The deadline has passed to lock in new federal rules that will be safe from a possible GOP trifecta’s having the ability to quickly overturn them next year. But it’s wild to imagine Republicans explicitly campaigning in favor of businesses’ having a right to make Americans’ lives harder and more annoying. Conversely, these are policies that Harris will absolutely want to highlight as she barrels toward Election Day. Reuters reported Tuesday that she’ll deliver a policy-centered speech this week focused on plans “to lower costs for middle-class families and take on corporate price-gouging.” In doing so, Harris will be able to provide a sharp contrast between the GOP ticket’s dark plans for America and a brighter future — one in which canceling your gym membership no longer feels as taxing as a workout."

"I don’t live in Minnesota. But thanks to Tim Walz, my life-saving OB-GYN does.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 3:07 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 13, 2024, 3:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-minnesota-abortion-south-dakota-doctor-rcna166308,"Life is about choices.  Shortly after my beloved grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it was clear that I had a choice: I could remain thousands of miles away, in Brooklyn, New York, where I have happily lived for eight years, or I could pack up my family of four and move to rural South Dakota to be closer to my extended family.  My husband and I decided to move. But on the day before we started looking for houses, I found out I was pregnant.  Suddenly, I wasn’t just choosing to move to a new state. I was choosing to move to a new state with a near-total abortion ban while carrying a high-risk “geriatric” pregnancy and a history of pregnancy-related complications.  Around the same time, the country was presented with its own surprise choice. After President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris dramatically changed the course of the upcoming election. The Democratic nominee for president injected hope and joy into an election cycle previously dominated by fear and despair. Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate pushed progressive optimism into overdrive.  Walz has defied the stereotypical caricatures of white, straight, male Midwestern politicians. From fighting to end period poverty in schools, to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights and providing free breakfast and lunch for all Minnesota students, Walz is a living reminder that the middle half of this country is not uniformly conservative or inherently regressive.  In 2023, in response to the Supreme Court defying decades of legal precedent and overturning Roe v. Wade, Walz signed a law enshrining abortion access into Minnesota statutes, ensuring that the state will continue to offer abortion care regardless of the courts system.  Now, at 22 weeks pregnant, it’s a law I am directly benefiting from.  Living just 30-ish minutes from the state’s border, I drive 45 minutes into Minnesota to receive my prenatal care at Pipestone County Medical Center. It was not easy to set up care in a neighboring state; I had to guarantee that my insurance would cover out-of-state costs, that my provider in New York state could send over medical records, and that the team in Pipestone, Minnesota, could take on another (out-of-state) patient.  After two weeks of calls, emails and yes, even faxes, appointments were made and I was assured by a nurse that I was in good hands, that I would be cared for, that if the worst-case scenario occurred my Minnesota team would be legally able to help.  In South Dakota, abortions are banned with very limited exceptions and providing an illegal abortion is a felony. While physicians are permitted to administer abortion care if the life of the pregnant person is in danger, like all abortion exceptions the language is vague and has left doctors, nurses and health care providers to navigate a treacherous gray area. I’m all too aware of the risks. Studies have shown and countless stories have highlighted a horrifying post-Roe reality: pregnant people in need of lifesaving abortion or miscarriage care have been turned away, or have been forced to endure invasive, unnecessary C-sections in order to spare attending doctors the possibility of hefty fines and possible jail time.  One recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics found that Texas’ abortion ban is responsible for an increase in the state’s infant mortality rate. At 37 years old, my pregnancy is automatically considered more dangerous. I also have experienced multiple miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and the loss of a twin at nearly 20 weeks gestation that forced me to give birth to one baby who was alive alongside the remains of a fetus. Given this history, I did not want to even chance the possibility of becoming another statistic in yet another study that highlights the devastating impact of abortion bans.  So I will make the choice, over and over again during my pregnancy, to cross state lines and ensure comprehensive prenatal care that, if necessary, could legally include an abortion. I will choose to give birth in a state I do not call home, just in case I experience a labor complication that South Dakota state physicians might be too scared to help me survive.  But this choice is not offered to countless pregnant people in South Dakota, or in the 21 other states that ban or severely restrict a common medical procedure that an estimated 1 out of every 4 women (as well as trans and nonbinary people) undergo in their lifetime.  An estimated 25 million women live in a state that bans or severely restricts abortion care. One recent Associated Press analysis found that more than 100 pregnant people have been either turned away from or negligently treated at emergency rooms since 2022. An estimated 1 in 5 women are traveling an average of 86 miles to receive the abortion care they want and need. Recently, two women living in Texas have filed federal complaints after they were denied abortion care to treat life-ending ectopic pregnancies and, as a result, nearly died. Fellow Texan Ryan Hamilton wrote down, in excruciating detail, the sequence of events after complications from an incomplete miscarriage — and medical staff reluctant to intervene — that nearly led to his wife's death. Walz’s so-called “abortion sanctuary state” gave me that choice, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing my physicians will never face federal prosecution for providing me with the care I may need.  Now, the nation has a similar choice. As Republicans continue to attack abortion rights and champion a nationwide abortion ban, Harris and her running mate are providing the country with an alternative — one that trusts pregnant people to make their own decisions about their bodies, pregnancies and families; that empowers physicians to do their jobs and adhere to their Hippocratic oaths; that continues to ensure parenthood is not a punishment for having sex but one of life’s overwhelming, joyful, scary, wonderful decisions. Life is about choices. I hope, come November, this country makes the right one. "
Judge Reed O'Connor recuses himself from Elon Musk's advertiser lawsuit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 1:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/elon-musk-reed-oconnor-recusal-advertiser-lawsuit-rcna166437,"When lawyers for Elon Musk’s “X Corp.” filed an antitrust lawsuit against advertisers in the Wichita Falls division of the Northern District of Texas, the case was destined for U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, who has several right-wing rulings to his resume. But the apparent judge-shopping was foiled Tuesday when O’Connor recused himself from the case. Why did he do so? His brief filing didn’t say.  The recusal comes after NPR reporting on the judge’s investment in Tesla stock, which NPR noted “has fueled questions over O’Connor’s fairness as a judge, since the outcome of the suits filed by [Tesla CEO] Musk’s X could impact his business empire.” However, in the other suit to which NPR referred — against watchdog Media Matters — O’Connor has not recused. It would’ve been helpful if the judge had explained the reasoning for his recusal. Whatever the judge’s rationale or what comes of either suit (though Musk’s chances in one may now be dimmer without O’Connor), the episode highlights the absurdity of apparent judge shopping: As NPR pointed out, none of the parties in either case is based in Texas. The advertiser case was reassigned to another judge in the Northern District, Ed Kinkeade. The recusal occurred alongside another, unrelated legal development for Musk. The UAW said on Tuesday that it has filed federal labor charges against him and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, stemming from comments they made during a conversation on X on Monday night. The UAW characterized the rhetoric as “illegal attempts to threaten and intimidate workers who stand up for themselves by engaging in protected concerted activity, such as strikes.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

North Carolina Republican candidates are breaking the 'crazy meter',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 1:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/north-carolina-republicans-candidates-robinson-morrow-rcna166440,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 12 episode of ""The Rachel Maddow Show."" The last time a Democratic presidential candidate won North Carolina was Barack Obama in 2008. But since Vice President Kamala Harris moved to the top of the Democratic ticket three weeks ago, Democrats are feeling like North Carolina may be in reach for them again. A new poll released by YouGov on Sunday shows Donald Trump and Harris currently tied in North Carolina at 46% each. Some of that is absolutely the relative appeal of the two candidates and their campaigns, but part of what may be lifting Democrats in North Carolina is that the Republican candidate for governor there is — and I believe this is the technical term — cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.Republican Mark Robinson calls gay people “filth.” He says schoolteachers are “wicked people.” He has mocked and attacked school shooting survivors. He has warned ominously that the music industry is run by the Illuminati. He said the film “Black Panther” was created by Jews and “satanic Marxists.” And he has — perhaps you won’t find this surprising — engaged in Holocaust denial. This man is the Republican nominee for governor in a totally normal state, a real place called North Carolina. That same YouGov poll that found Trump and Harris tied in the presidential race in North Carolina found Robinson losing the governor’s race to Democrat Josh Stein by a whopping 10 points. Now there’s new reporting highlighting another statewide Republican candidate in North Carolina who is right up there with Robinson on the crazy meter. In a since-deleted Facebook livestream unearthed by CNN, Michele Morrow, the Republican nominee to run North Carolina public schools, can reportedly be seen in a Washington, D.C.-area hotel the night of Jan. 6, 2021, advocating for a military coup to keep Trump in power. Previously Morrow called for the killing of Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats, including the public execution of former President Barack Obama.Again, this is now the Republican nominee for superintendent of all public K-12 education in North Carolina. Notably, Morrow calls public schools “socialism centers” and “indoctrination centers.” She is endorsed by Robinson, who said at a recent event with her, “We’re gonna make sure we do everything to get you in office.” With folks like that leading the statewide Republican ticket in North Carolina, Democrats think their presidential ticket has a real shot. The Democratic National Committee has now put up 15 new billboards across North Carolina as part of its first swing state paid advertising blitz since Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. So with the election rapidly approaching, keep an eye on North Carolina and watch this space.

Kamala Harris' new ad is a pitch-perfect response to Donald Trump's attacks,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 1:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/kamala-harris-immigration-record-donald-trump-rcna166421,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Vice President Kamala Harris is going on the offense, and touting what she sees as her tough immigration record in a new campaign ad. Since she entered the race, Republicans have attacked Harris over the issue, falsely labeling her as the administration’s “border czar.” This ad is exactly what the vice president should be doing: You go in on the issue that your opponent thinks is your weakness and make it your strength. It’s something Harris has done effectively on the campaign trail already. And it’s something that I suspect she’ll do effectively at the debate next month.  It’s very simple and the facts speak for themselves here. In July, border crossings were lower than during Donald Trump’s last month in the White House. There’s also the border bill backed by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma — the most conservative immigration bill in decades. While Harris supported that deal, Trump stopped it — ordering House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson to kill the bill.  He did so because the bill would not only be good for those on the border who are concerned about illegal immigration, but also because it would be good news politically for President Joe Biden. The ad was an effective way for Harris’ campaign to hit back against Trump and Republicans’ misinformation on her immigration record. We’ll see how it plays with voters in the coming weeks."
JD Vance uses his wife to whitewash Trump’s white supremacist problem,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 12:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-usha-trump-white-supremacist-nick-fuentes-rcna166282,"Sen. JD Vance tried to paper over former President Donald Trump’s connection with white nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes during an interview over the weekend.  Speaking with ABC News’ Jon Karl, Vance was asked about Trump’s widely criticized dinner with Fuentes and the Hitler-loving rapper, Ye in 2022, as well as Fuentes’ recent comments that Trump shouldn't have picked Vance as a running mate in part because Vance’s wife, Usha, is Indian American. Trump’s VP pick agreed with Karl’s summation of Fuentes’ attacks on his wife as “racist garbage.”  But after Karl noted “this is also a guy that dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago during this campaign,” Vance chimed in with some spin.  He said: After Vance falsely claimed Trump condemned his own dinner with Fuentes amid the backlash, Karl corrected him and noted that Trump has never condemned Fuentes or his views.  And that’s when Vance claimed his wife’s personal interactions with Trump assured him.  He said:  Evidently, Vance wants us to believe Trump’s willingness to dine with an avowed white supremacist and a Nazi-loving rapper is merely a sign of his welcoming nature. And Vance doesn't appear to have any qualms about using his Indian American wife, or her purportedly amiable interactions with Trump, to downplay the questions about the candidate’s ties to white supremacy and antisemitic hate. Usha Vance previously sat for an interview and attempted to downplay her husband’s misogynistic ""childless cat ladies"" comment. Now, her husband is using her ethnicity and gender to downplay Trump’s deference to bigots. Republicans have spent the better part of the past two weeks ridiculously accusing Democrats of antisemitism after Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.  Meanwhile, Trump and the GOP’s open association with antisemitic figures, including Fuentes and Ye, go unmentioned. Republicans haven’t devised a cogent explanation for this hypocrisy. And if Vance’s remarks are any sign, they won’t anytime soon. "
Roger Stone says his email accounts were how the hackers got into the Trump campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 12:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/roger-stone-email-hack-trump-campaign-rcna166422,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Donald Trump who helped to push the fake electors scheme, told the Washington Post that one of his email accounts was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack that was targeting the Trump campaign. The news surrounding this hack has been moving quickly, so let's review the sequence of events so far.  The juicy story here is that one of the most mischievous and aggressively outspoken figures in Trump’s orbit was the one whose private communications appears to have compromised — and possibly compromised others in the Trump campaign, as well. But a notable subplot is the media’s markedly different response to hacked campaign documents when they come into their hands directly, as compared to the 2016 feeding frenzy over private communications stolen from the Clinton campaign and made public by Wikileaks. The Associated Press is out with a story on the media outlets that have thus far chosen not to publish documents they've received as a result of the hack.  Remember when Trump literally called on Russia to ""find"" missing Clinton emails and declared his love for WikiLeaks?  Now Trump is benefitting from a restraint that neither he nor the media have afforded other politicians in a similar situation. Joy Reid called out this double standard on Monday’s episode of The ReidOut.

5th Circuit says 'geofence' warrants violate the Fourth Amendment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 10:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/geofence-warrant-fourth-amendment-fifth-circuit-rcna166370,"The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has broken new ground again — but perhaps not in the way you might think. While that court has issued extreme rulings aligned with Republican Party preferences that have gone too far even for the Supreme Court, this latest decision deals with the Fourth Amendment, an area of the law where opinions can cut across party lines. And now this issue could be headed for the justices, too. This time, a 5th Circuit panel held that so-called geofence warrants are unconstitutional. Such warrants seek location information within a certain area and time frame as a means to identify suspects; in the case of United States v. Smith, it was used to find robbers. In reaching its conclusion, the appeals court has split with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said recently in United States v. Chatrie that it didn’t count as a Fourth Amendment “search” when the government got two hours’ worth of location information from Google that had been voluntarily exposed by the defendant. Such “circuit splits,” as they’re called, generally increase the chances of Supreme Court review, because the justices can resolve them to ensure uniformity across the country. But this issue might not be settled by the high court soon, for a couple of reasons. First, the rulings aren’t necessarily the last word within the circuits, because both cases were three-judge panel decisions, and the full appeals courts in both circuits could weigh in and reach different conclusions. If that happens, then the decisions of those full courts could determine the next moves. The 5th Circuit covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, while the 4th Circuit covers Maryland, the Virginias and the Carolinas. Moreover, the Supreme Court hasn’t been eager to take Fourth Amendment cases lately. Its biggest such case in recent years was Carpenter v. United States, decided in 2018. But both of these geofence warrant rulings cite Carpenter to reach different conclusions, showing that the justices have open questions to settle in this area of the law.

Why Elon Musk’s hugely hyped X talk with Trump was so disappointing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 7:25 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-elon-musk-x-interview-zero-surprises-zero-appeal-rcna166309,"X owner Elon Musk hosted former President Donald Trump for a much-anticipated conversation on Spaces on Monday night. Musk — who has endorsed Trump and is actively using his wealth and influence to get him elected again — stressed at the outset that this would be a “non-adversarial” conversation aimed at “open-minded, independent voters who might be trying to make up their mind.” But before that performatively centrist intro, the event started much like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ glitch-plagued, campaign-imploding Twitter Spaces interview with Musk in May 2023 — disastrously. People looking to tune into the Musk-Trump conversation were mostly met with a blank purple square for more than 40 minutes.  Musk blamed the technical failure on a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. But as The Verge quickly reported, the rest of the site was operating just fine, indicating such an attack was highly unlikely.  As the delay dragged on, the billionaire Mark Pincus, another self-avowed Democrat for Trump,  tweeted in response to Musk's attack claim, “Its Dems fighting to ‘save’ Democracy from two massive disrupters!” [sic] Musk, ever the seeker of truth,  replied: “Yeah.” And that’s how Musk handled most of the conversation. He’d tee up Trump not with questions, but with semi-coherent pronouncements about illegal immigration or urban crime or how climate change is no big deal and we shouldn’t “demonize” oil and gas industry executives who are literally “saving civilization” as we speak. (Musk, during the conversation, described his own position on the topic as “pretty moderate.”) Trump would then reply in the same manner as his broadly panned RNC acceptance speech — interminably parroting random pieces of MAGA bromides. Musk would chirp into these soliloquies with an occasional “Yeah.”  Sometimes he’d sprinkle in an “I agree with you” or a “You make an interesting point.” But the alphaest of alpha male civilization-saving tech bros reduced himself to an unctuous hype man for an ever-more inarticulate Trump.  During the interview, Musk repeatedly said he’s been mostly apolitical throughout his life but also, confusingly, that he’s been a left-leaning Democrat his whole life.  And Musk wasn’t hiding the ball. He was quite clear on the point of this conversation — to convince persuadable voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is a Marxist, Israel-hating, open borders-advocating, cop-criminalizing supervillain. Moments later, they’d paint her as a cowardly, unaccomplished idiot not even smart enough to handle a conversation like the one they were having.  Musk and Trump both present as very needy men, perpetually thirsty for praise. So I’ll give them something: It is a remarkable achievement for two of the most powerful and influential right-wing political figures of our time to say essentially nothing of substance for over two hours and five minutes. Don, Elon — I’m impressed. To comprehensively fact-check this wet sandbox of rhetoric-heavy, meme-level political discourse is probably not worth the effort.  Suffice to say, Trump’s claims that the Democratic Republic of Congo is emptying its prisons to send them to the U.S. as migrants are not true. Nor is it true, as Trump insisted, that Harris is more left-wing than democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. It is also plainly untrue that Trump is a champion of free speech, as Musk declared.  As is Musk’s insistence that inflation — a global issue exacerbated by the pandemic — can be curbed simply by empowering something he called a “government efficiency commission” and deregulating all major industries (like the ones in which he owns companies). Whichever political direction one leans, economics are a little more complicated than that. But top men such as Musk and Trump are rarely told by their friends/employees that they’re not making any sense and that they should probably read up on the subject before pontificating in front of a million X Spaces listeners.  There were two moments where the conversation had a chance of becoming mildly interesting.  One was when Trump complained that artificial intelligence uses a lot of electricity. If Musk were as brave and inquisitive as his devotees claim, this would have been a great opportunity to show it. But the crypto-enthusiast Musk, rather than defend his preferred technologies’ outrageous use of energy, simply changed the subject back to his prospective “government efficiency commission.”  The other almost-interesting moment was when Trump rambled about certain places he says were made uninhabitable for thousands of years after nuclear plant accidents. Musk — for the first and only time in the conversation — pushed back on Trump, saying he’d been to Fukushima (the site of the nuclear plant disaster in 2011) and eaten locally grown vegetables.  Trump, in a role reversal, replied, “Yeah, yeah.” The pretense that people like Musk are courageous for hosting “civil” conversations like this remains ridiculous, but it’s a well-worn cliche at this point, the opposite of shocking.   And maybe I’m jaded by the lowering of standards that came with the rise of Trump, but there was nothing exceptional about this event. It was dull, uninformative and relentlessly repetitive. Both Musk and Trump have followers who would walk into the sea on their commands, but sitting through this entire thing takes a certain dedication. If you’re looking for two hours of overcompensating attempts at hypermasculinity, basic GOP fearmongering talking points about crime and immigration, and a touch of slobbering back-patting about free speech and civility — the Musk/Trump show is your ticket.

Republicans go to Supreme Court in bid to enforce Arizona voting law,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 6:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/republicans-supreme-court-arizona-voter-registration-law-rcna166267,"As November’s presidential election nears, one legal question that arises is how involved the Supreme Court will get. The impending resolution of an emergency bid from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans in a battleground state dispute could give us a sense this month of how the high court will handle requests to intervene this election season. Republicans want the court to permit Arizona to enforce a state law that requires documentary proof of citizenship in order to vote. They’re challenging a federal appeals court panel’s approval of a district court injunction against the law. The GOP told the justices that the injunction “is an unprecedented abrogation of the Arizona Legislature’s sovereign authority to determine the qualifications of voters and structure participation in its elections.” Republicans are seeking an immediate pause of the injunction to the extent that it requires the state to (1) accept voter registration applications without documentary proof of citizenship and (2) allow voters who have not provided documentary proof of citizenship to cast ballots for president or vote by mail. Notably, the three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel approved the injunction over dissent from a Trump appointee, which could get at least some of the justices’ attention. Indeed, the application cites the dissent from Judge Patrick Bumatay, echoing what he deemed the unusual procedural history of the case, in which his appellate panel ruled differently than an earlier circuit panel. Bumatay wrote: “All the public can take away from this episode is that four judges of the Ninth Circuit have voted to partially stay the injunction here, while two other judges voted against it. The two judges prevail — not because of any special insight, but because of the luck of an internal Ninth Circuit draw.” The more recent panel majority said that the earlier panel “overlooked ‘considerations specific to election cases’ and misunderstood the extent of confusion and chaos that would be engendered by a late-stage alteration to the status quo of Arizona’s election rules in apparent disregard of the Supreme Court’s admonitions in Purcell v. Gonzalez.” But in their application to the justices, Republicans said it’s the more recent appeals court that used the Purcell case incorrectly, arguing that the Supreme Court “has repeatedly instructed that the Purcell principle bars federal courts from enjoining the enforcement of state election laws with an election impending.” So the outcome could hinge on which side the high court thinks has the better reading of this principle, an important one for election cases. A written response to the application from voting rights groups is due Friday. The application cited an Aug. 22 deadline, so we may learn by then how the justices will settle this challenge — and perhaps get a hint of what’s to come as we head toward November.

RFK Jr.'s campaign is in decline. It could still be decisive on Election Day.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-jr-trump-harris-third-party-election-rogan-rcna166263,"Robert Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign is in decline. But his presence in the election remains significant, and it looks like he could be a major thorn in former President Donald Trump’s side should he stay in the race through Election Day. For many months Kennedy was averaging around 10% in national presidential polls that matched him up against Trump and President Joe Biden. After Biden dropped out and Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as his replacement, Kennedy’s support swiftly halved, and he’s averaging around 5% in the polls now. Kennedy has been participating in conferences and events, but he has otherwise vanished from the campaign trail for over a month, NBC News reports. And Nicole Shanahan, his running mate, campaign funder and valiant warrior against demonic control of the federal government, has been missing from the campaign stump for even longer. A good chunk of Kennedy’s decline can be explained by Harris’ rise. One of the key dynamics of the Biden-Trump 2024 match-up was the significant contingent of so-called double haters, voters who hold unfavorable views of Biden and Trump. While Harris is also underwater when it comes to favorability ratings, she’s still significantly more popular than Biden. She’s younger and more energetic than him, she seems less encumbered by some voters’ anxieties about the Biden administration’s economic record, and she has completely transformed the party’s 2024 messaging, giving voters something fresh and new to grapple with. “There’s no doubt that Kamala Harris has picked up some undecided and third-party support since she’s become the nominee,” David Wasserman, a senior editor and an elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, recently told The Atlantic. While Democrats have targeted Trump world with the insult “weird,” Kennedy has emerged as the person in the race who is most deserving of that label. In May, news emerged that Kennedy said in a 2012 deposition that a worm ate part of his brain. More recently, Kennedy released an utterly bizarre video in which he tells antisemitic conspiracy theorist Roseanne Barr that he left a dead bear cub in Central Park and staged it so it would look like it was killed in a collision with a bicycle. In an attempt to share more about his personal life, he told The New York Times that he once lived with an emu that used to attack his wife. While it’s unclear if this kind of news hurt his standing with his supporters, it certainly could not have helped him grow his base of support as an exciting new candidate emerged for the Democratic Party. But Kennedy’s numbers are still significant enough to play a potentially decisive role on Election Day, and recent polls show that in polls with three-way match-ups he is consistently hurting Trump more than he’s hurting Harris. That makes sense, considering that Kennedy’s campaign has focused most aggressively on a libertarian attitude toward public health and conspiracy theories about race, vaccines and satanic cabals — the kinds of ideas that appeal to many in the MAGA camp. Last week, Joe Rogan, the world’s most popular podcaster and a thought leader for millions of American men, praised Kennedy as “the only one that makes sense to me.” (Rogan later clarified that his comment was not meant as an endorsement.) But Rogan’s comments were enough to enrage Trump and his allies, who are already on the defensive after Harris’ rise and aware that the fundamental energy of the race has slipped out of their control, at least for now. The Democratic Party has figured out a path to mitigate its double haters problem and most likely increased its vote share because of it. But Republicans do not appear to have a plan. They’re banking on a man who has repeated the same white nationalist and authoritarian rants ad nauseam for close to a decade — and only seems increasingly discursive and incoherent while he does it. Unless Kennedy drops out (and possibly endorses Trump, as Trump has reportedly showed interest in), Trump is likely to face some vexing competition from the other crank in the race."
Trump is letting Vance do the heavy lifting. That could backfire.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-campaign-events-rcna166236,"I’ll give him this: Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has been hustling. The GOP’s vice presidential candidate spent the last week doing some heavy campaigning around the country before appearing on three Sunday shows. But it stands in stark contrast to how low-energy the guy at the top of the ticket, former President Donald Trump, has been since accepting the Republican nomination last month. If you were to ask Vance, it’s all part of the plan. The running mate is traditionally an attack dog for the nominee, a role that he has seemed eager to play in targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. But Trump’s slow pace is odd, even when you consider that August is traditionally a slow month in the presidential campaign season. At some point, if Vance is perceived as doing most of the heavy lifting for the campaign, that could become a major hindrance to Trump’s chances this fall. I’m not bringing up Trump’s sparse schedule to claim that the number of rallies a candidate holds is determinative of who wins an election. Nor am I saying anything similar about crowd sizes, no matter how much it irks him that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have been drawing huge audiences. It does, however, speak to electoral strategy and the lack of any sort of shift from Trump’s camp even as the race has fundamentally changed. When President Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Trump directed the Republican National Committee to divert funds from field operations and get-out-the-vote programs to focus on “election integrity.” His argument at the time was built on the belief that that’s still the greatest motivator to get his supporters out to the polls. But he hasn’t been putting himself out there nearly as much as that bravado would suggest. In fact, he held only a handful of events last week, not counting his hastily called fact-free press conference to try to draw the spotlight back to himself. This sluggishness wasn’t always the case with Trump. During his last two campaigns, he was a very different creature on the stump, sometimes holding multiple rallies in a single day, according to an analysis from The Washington Post’s Philip Bump. In contrast, the newly minted Democratic duo hit up seven stops over the course of five days, absolutely smoking Trump’s lethargic pace. And while it makes sense that the Harris-Walz ticket is in a hurry to introduce itself to voters with just under three months until Election Day, you’d think the Trump campaign would stress a similar urgency on its boss. Instead, it was left up to Vance to tail Harris and Walz around the swing states. The plan was to hit at Harris on issues on which the GOP feels she’s weak: immigration, crime and the economy. But as my colleague Jim Downie explained on Monday, those are all areas where things are improving as we get closer to Election Day, potentially blunting the Republican message against Democrats across the board. Vance’s appearances were also much more sparsely attended than the Harris-Walz events, setting up an unflattering contrast that couldn’t have made Trump happy. Even his attempts to directly confront Harris fell flat. Vance’s decision to literally do a press stop next to Air Force Two in Wisconsin didn’t produce much more than one of the most cringeworthy photo shoots of the election season. It doesn’t help that Vance isn’t exactly Mr. Popular these days. The messaging from Democrats since he was named Trump’s running mate appears to be sticking, according to recent polling. Since the GOP convention, Vance has “become more and more identified with his particular brand of conservatism and less with his famed biography as an author, veteran, and politician,” according to Semafor’s Kadia Goba. Tellingly, when you look at FiveThirtyEight’s polling aggregate, Vance’s unfavorable ratings are higher than Trump’s, which is really saying something. Vance is calling his stalking tour a win so far though, bragging about his Sunday show appearances on X while criticizing Harris’ lack of tough interviews since she became the presumptive nominee. As talking points go, focusing on whether Harris has done as many press appearances as he has doesn’t seem like a strong one. It honestly feels like a remnant of the race against Biden, when the main message was that Biden is too old to properly campaign. This all matters because beyond the energy and enthusiasm that have suffused throughout the Democratic base, the Harris campaign is using its events to sign up volunteers and do other ground-level work necessary to win in November. If Trump is still set to be the main GOTV force, he’s going to have to start pulling his weight rather than letting Vance be the voice of the ticket. And yet, it’s ironically Trump’s inability to stick to a message against Harris in his public appearances that has the potential to make Vance into the more reliable — if underwhelming — campaigner. There is still time for things to shift and Trump to pick up the pace again. Both he and Vance are going to be on the trail this week, including on Wednesday, when they’ll split North Carolina and Michigan between them. Vance will have the earlier appearance, but it’ll be worth seeing just how much more of a crowd Trump draws to his event. All told, the signs point to Vance’s anointment as the future of the MAGA movement as a bit premature — it turns out there’s still nobody quite like Donald Trump."
How Project 2025 plans to reshape the American family,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 3:02 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-reshape-family-christian-nationalism-trump-rcna166276,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 11 episode of “Velshi.” Project 2025, the authoritarian blueprint for dismantling federal agencies in the next Republican presidency, has a lot of thoughts on what your private relationships should look like and whom you should marry.  In fact, a Christian nationalist vision of the family is a key centerpiece of the 922-page manual. It describes proposals for the American family as “central to the next conservative President’s agenda:"" According to Project 2025, not all families are created equal. On page 451, it defines the “right” kind of family as “a married mother, father, and their children.” It claims this is the “foundation of a well-ordered nation and a healthy society.” Promoting this biblical concept of family is cited as a top-five goal for a revamped Department of Health and Human Services, which it criticizes for “having lost its way” by “promoting equity in everything we do.” The document says efforts at promoting diversity should be repealed and replaced with policies that support what it calls the formation of “stable, married, nuclear families.” In other words, the authors of Project 2025 believe they have the right to dictate what your family should look like, extending the arm of government into your home — and into your bedroom — to enforce a Christian nationalist worldview. They consider this not just a policy preference, but a core function of governance itself. So much for limited government. It should be noted that traditional families — people who are married with children — no longer make up the majority of family compositions in the U.S., according to recent polling by the Pew Research Center. This shift in family structures is due in part to more same-sex couples adopting children or starting their own families, reflecting the diverse and evolving landscape of today’s American society. That diversity, according to the authors of Project 2025, poses a danger to “the very moral foundations of our society.”  The document lays out several proposals for undermining the rights of those who don’t fit the biblical definition of a family. For instance, it wants the government to protect the right of businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples and says that federal grants should be made available to faith-based groups that refuse to recognize same-sex marriage, specifically, groups that, “affirm that marriage is between not just any two adults, but one man and one unrelated woman.” While acknowledging that this would violate the Respect for Marriage Act, which bans discrimination against same-sex couples, the document nonetheless calls for the government to “protect faith-based grant recipients that maintain a biblically based, social science–reinforced definition of marriage and family.” Its policy proposals also demonize children raised in nontraditional households, stating, “Social science reports that assess the outcomes for children raised in homes aside from a heterosexual, intact marriage are clear: All other family forms involve higher levels of instability; financial stress or poverty; or poorer behavioral, psychological, or educational outcomes.” Federally funded family planning clinics would be required to actively promote “the importance of marriage” which describes homes without a husband as “among the most dangerous places for a child to be.” Offensive and bigoted terminology is casually passed off throughout its pages, including urging the next DHS secretary to put an end to “woke transgender activism.” One especially alarming proposal is to criminalize transgender identity as pornography. This proposal likely takes its cue from Russia’s so-called gay propaganda bill passed in 2022, which bans all forms of what it refers to as LGBTQ “propaganda” and prohibits Russians from promoting same-sex relationships. Similarly, Project 2025 considers the “propagation of transgender ideology” to be pornography. The document also mirrors similar rhetoric used by extremist groups such as Moms for Liberty to oppose drag queen reading hours and to keep LGBTQ+ books out of libraries. Just five pages into the foreword, the document states, “The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.” It also classifies gender reassignment surgery as a form of child abuse. To confront these “threats” to straight heterosexual couples, Project 2025 proposes economic incentives for traditional nuclear families, advocating for policymakers to “use government power, including through the tax code, to restore the American family.” By redirecting federal funding to support its biblical view of family, same-sex couples or other family structures would be denied equal benefits given to straight, heterosexual couples. And the timeline for implementing all this? As soon as Donald Trump takes office, which the document assumes is a given.  “Conservatives have just two years and one shot to get this right. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.  The next conservative President will enter office on January 20, 2025, with a simple choice: greatness or failure.” This “very idea of America” seems to exclude the vast majority of American families today, most of whom don’t fit the Christian nationalist mold.

Republican candidate in North Carolina called for a Trump coup on Jan. 6,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/north-carolina-republican-trump-coup-michele-morrow-rcna166281,"This week brought yet another example of how Republican extremism may cost the party in a key state in November. A couple of months back, I wrote about the North Carolina GOP’s placing all of its bets on extreme candidates for statewide office, potentially creating an opening for moderate Democrats. At the time, I focused on attorney general candidate Dan Bishop, who compared Donald Trump’s treatment in his criminal court cases to being a Black Southerner in the Jim Crow era. But there’s also unabashedly bigoted gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson and Chad Brown, a lesser-known secretary of state candidate who has pushed the GOP’s bogus “election integrity” rhetoric and previously touted an endorsement from hate-mongering baseball legend Curt Schilling.  Another person on my list was Michele Morrow, the far-right superintendent candidate who has recorded herself complaining about people speaking foreign languages in public and, according to CNN, previously called for the execution of Democrats like President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.  Last week, CNN reported more disturbing details about Morrow’s past behavior.  According to CNN: CNN linked to public videos of Morrow at the Capitol during the deadly Jan. 6 riot, but it said it has no proof she entered the building or committed violence herself. Still, the video evidence — shared by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski — of Morrow effectively calling for a pro-Trump military coup after the riot failed is unsettling, given things we already know about her. In a few short months, Morrow could win control over North Carolina’s public school system. It’s a frightening prospect and one Democrats would be smart to highlight as they lay out the stakes of this race — along with others featuring GOP extremists in North Carolina — this November."
Olympians giving their all for the U.S. should get more in return,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 2:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/paris-olympics-healthcare-tiktok-ariana-ramsey-rcna166059,"The Olympics have come to an end after what feels like an exceptionally triumphant two weeks. Paris 2024 is being hailed by some as the best Olympics we’ve ever seen, in terms of production, ratings and the overall quality of competition. It was certainly triumphant for the United States, which finishes the Games atop the leaderboard in overall medals and tied with China for first in golds. Between Team USA basketball, the USWNT, Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, track and field — these Olympics were a showcase of excellence and at times redemption for the Americans. At a time of great division, for two weeks at least, we were all patriots. But the Olympics have always presented a profound dilemma to me, as someone who has covered sport through a critical lens for more than a decade. (Shameless plug: There’s an entire chapter in my book about this very dilemma.) I absolutely adore the Olympics — the joy, the spectacle, and most of all, the all-too-rare showcasing of women’s sports. But historically, they’ve been a hotbed for corruption and bribery, cost overruns, doping scandals, environmental havoc, militarized policing, population displacement and sportswashing — when major sporting events serve to distract from a country’s very real problems, whether it’s political turmoil, human rights abuses or the struggles of everyday people to pay for housing or health care. It’s that last part I find myself thinking about now that the Games are over, as we all return to the reality of the challenges we face at home. The Olympics highlighted many issues we can’t just ignore through gold-colored glasses. The USA Water Polo team was among the feel-good stories of the competition, with Flavor Flav becoming its No. 1 hype man, lending his star power and his dollars to the women’s team in particular. But let’s not lose sight of why he felt he had to get involved in the first place: It was in response to Maggie Steffen’s Instagram post calling for increased financial support. Steffens noted that most athletes work second and third jobs to fund their journeys to the Olympic stage.  For two weeks every four years, we exalt these athletes as the best examples of American excellence; we proudly uphold them as star-spangled avatars for all of us; we point to every medal as evidence that we are indeed the greatest country in the world. But once the Olympics are over, we largely leave these athletes to fend for themselves, implying that the glory and privilege of representing our nation should be enough. That dynamic was especially stark in the case of discus thrower Veronica Fraley, who posted on social media that she was struggling to pay her rent the day before she was set to compete. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian saw the post and sent her money, and her GoFundMe page has raised more than her $20,000 goal since the story went viral. It was a lovely gesture. But athletes shouldn’t have to rely on the benevolence of wealthy, celebrity fans or crowdsourcing just to make ends meet, especially not when the institutions they play for are benefiting so much from their achievements.  It’s indicative of a broader trend we’re seeing with everyday Americans. Stories abound detailing people with catastrophic medical conditions in dire financial straits who were only able to survive due to the kindness of strangers. Some medical professionals actively recommend crowdsourcing as a way to pay for medical bills, to the point where The Atlantic declared GoFundMe “a health care utility.” The heartwarming headlines from the Olympics and the generosity of people like Flavor Flav, Ohanian and smaller GoFundMe donors are billed as feel-good stories, but they also serve to placate us into accepting the current state of things. But if anything, these Olympics demonstrated firsthand that it doesn’t have to be this way. USA Rugby player Ariana Ramsey went viral for using her time in Paris to take advantage of the free health care provided in the Olympic Village. Ramsey was astounded to walk into the clinic and receive basic preventative care like pap smears and teeth cleaning at no cost. “I haven’t had an eye exam in a really long time,” Ramsey told The Washington Post. “So, I was like: Why not get one if it’s going to be completely free? I don’t have to worry about trying to find a primary care practitioner who takes my insurance.” All the medals in the world can’t obscure the fact that the United States is the only high-income country without universal health care. So, as we come down from our Olympic high and continue to celebrate our beloved athletes (I would run through a brick wall for Jordan Chiles), let’s stop to think about the things that truly make a country great. Access to health care, education, voting, personal safety, freedom to love, the pillars of democracy — they’re worth their weight in gold."
Debunking Trump's claim that the presidency was 'taken away' from Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 1:45 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-stolen-election-joe-biden-kamala-harris-fact-check-rcna166247,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 10 episode of ""Velshi."" After Donald Trump and his allies spent months dragging President Joe Biden for his age and mental acuity, they appeared to be caught flat-footed when someone younger and sharper took over the ticket. Now according to Trump, Americans are being ripped off because, get this, the campaign was stolen from Biden. Hearing Trump say that he cherishes the Constitution is pretty rich but this isn’t the first time he's made this claim. Trump has posted on Truth Social alleging, “the Democrats have Unconstitutionally taken a Candidate ... and unceremoniously replaced him with a new Candidate."" Team Trump has even likened the whole situation to a ""coup."" If you’re like me, you’ve been seeing versions of Trump’s lie all over social media. And maybe hearing it from your conservative uncle who likes to argue during family dinners. I don’t want to give credence to every ridiculous claim Trump throws out but this one seems worth debunking. So, for fact's sake, the presidency was not taken from Biden. Nor has Vice President Kamala Harris unconstitutionally robbed Biden of the Democratic nomination. In fact, the U.S. Constitution doesn't address the matter of party nomination processes. Here are some other talking points to politely provide to your extra-loud uncle: Biden won the vast majority of the Democratic delegates during the primary election process and clinched the presumptive nomination back in March. But he was not formally the Democratic nominee — he was the presumptive nominee. This allowed him to, after much consideration, step aside voluntarily. He was not kicked off the party ticket and while the whole gambit might’ve been a politically risky move, there’s nothing illegal about it. When Democratic primary voters selected Biden, Harris’ name was attached to his name and they chose her as vice president — you know, the role that takes over for the president if needed. So the argument that the American public did not have a chance to vote for Harris is categorically false. Also, they will have a chance to vote for her, or not vote for her, on Nov. 5.  The Democratic Party has a lot of rules in place for a situation as serious as a presidential election. There are rules for this exact scenario. Harris, in order to officially take Biden’s place on the ticket, needed to secure support from at least 2,350 Democratic convention delegates, including those who already pledged their support to Biden, and the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders dubbed the “superdelegates.”  Lo and behold, she did that. The Democratic National Committee had a virtual roll call to make sure everything was squared away and it was announced that Harris secured enough delegate votes to become the party’s nominee. To avoid any complications when it came to the physical ballot — the Democratic Party held that virtual roll call to make sure that Harris’ name, along with that of her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could be printed on the ballots by an Aug. 7 certification deadline. If the Democratic Party wanted to replace its nominee after the convention, that would be a different story. Though it still wouldn’t be unconstitutional, because the Constitution is silent on party nominations. Anyone who tells you otherwise is woefully misunderstanding this process or being deliberately misleading. As the MaddowBlog's Steve Benen puts it: But if Trump wants to talk about things that are unconstitutional and an attempt to steal an election away from the people ... I would be happy to remind him of Jan. 6th.

Trump cites Judge Cannon in seeking compensation for the Mar-a-Lago search,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 12:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-legal-filing-mar-a-lago-damages-rcna166222,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon and the Supreme Court have already helped Donald Trump in his criminal cases. Now he's using them to support his request for civil damages, too. A lawyer for the former president is citing Cannon and the justices in a filing that serves as a precursor to a possible federal lawsuit stemming from the 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property and subsequent charges for alleged unlawful retention of national defense information and obstruction. The filing may be best understood as a political document — claiming, as it does, “political persecution” against the GOP presidential nominee. But it’s notable how it leans on Trump’s own judicial appointees to justify that persecution narrative — even if closer inspection reveals that their rulings might not support this civil effort, however much they have helped him in his criminal cases. Cannon dismissed the classified documents case last month on the grounds that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded — a decision that Smith is challenging on appeal. The former president also invokes the recent Supreme Court ruling granting broad presidential immunity from prosecution, arguing in support of his civil “malicious prosecution” claim that: That argument is a little difficult to follow. Putting aside the relevance of Garland’s legal foresight, the Supreme Court broke new ground last month with a new (and vague) presidential immunity test. Whatever anyone might have guessed the court would do ahead of time, it wasn’t apparent until long after Mar-a-Lago was searched and Trump was charged. Plus, while the high court said that presidents get at least some immunity for official acts, that ruling came in the federal election interference case — not in the classified documents case, whose charges relate to Trump’s post-presidency conduct. Cannon likewise broke new ground last month when she dismissed the classified documents case. But that ruling didn’t deal with the underlying merits of the prosecution or the court-approved search that Trump complains of in his civil filing. There’s also the fact that it’s a trial-level ruling currently on appeal. Even if it survives appeal, it’s still difficult to see how Cannon’s decision on Smith’s appointment and funding calls into question the Mar-a-Lago search, which predated Smith’s appointment.   Trump also cites Cannon and the immunity ruling in his civil “abuse of process” claim — his third argument, in addition to malicious prosecution and “intrusion upon seclusion” (essentially, an invasion of privacy claim). In making his abuse of process argument, Trump’s counsel writes that “the lack of appropriations, a lack of a constitutionally appropriate appointment, and the unconstitutional nature of prosecuting an immune former President reflect the misuse of the prosecutorial process for an inappropriate — that is, a political — end.” But again, even if the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling somehow affects the classified documents case, and even if Cannon’s dismissal is upheld on appeal, it’s unclear how these rulings — which came after Trump was searched and charged — signal legal abuse in retrospect. There’s more to say about this new civil filing, and it’s unclear if it will turn into a full lawsuit or what will come of it if it does. The reason that it doesn’t go straight into court is that this sort of legal action against the federal government, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, starts with filing a notice to the agency involved — here, the Department of Justice, which can respond within six months. Trump claims $15 million in compensatory damages for alleged harm from legal costs, and $100 million in punitive damages (though, perhaps importantly if this moves forward, courts have noted that punitive damages aren’t available in FTCA cases). Whatever the outcome of this development, if it does go to court, it could test the degree to which Trump's luck in some of his criminal cases may extend to a civil case.

We have more questions than answers about Trump campaign’s hack claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 12:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-hacking-trump-campaign-jd-vance-rcna166162,"Politico reported Saturday that last month it began receiving internal documents, reportedly assessed as authentic by two knowledgeable sources, that seem to have been hacked from within the Trump campaign. Also on Saturday, The Washington Post revealed that it had received similar documents two days before. The Trump campaign issued a statement Saturday asserting that it had been hacked and blamed Iran. As a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, I have questions. The documents in question reportedly include a 271-page research document containing the results of Trump’s vetting of vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Forbes referred to that document as Vance’s “dirty laundry dossier,” implying that it might contain information painting Vance in a more unfavorable light than the struggling candidate is already in. Politico provided intriguing details of the email it received offering the material:  “The person said they had a ‘variety of documents from [Trump’s] legal and court documents to internal campaign discussions.’ Asked how they had obtained the documents, the person responded: ‘I suggest you don’t be curious about where I got them from. Any answer to this question, will compromise me and also legally restricts you from publishing them.’” Here are three questions that should be foremost on our minds as we process this alleged foreign attack on our election process. First, could it be true? Reports of the hack are eerily consistent with a report Friday from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center. Microsoft said Iran had “launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.” The Microsoft report then gets even more specific: “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.” That scenario reportedly matches the description of what happened to Trump’s campaign. Microsoft said it “notified those targeted.” Trump, on his Truth Social platform, said he was the person Microsoft had notified. Trump and Microsoft aren’t the only ones pointing to Iran. Just last month, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) publicly warned us of Iran’s intentions to influence the U.S. presidential election and to sow discord in America. When it comes to trying to mess with our election, this isn’t Iran’s first rodeo. According to a declassified ODNI report, in 2020 Iran “carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects.” As that election approached, Facebook announced it had disrupted Iranian and Russian operations aimed at U.S. election interference. Iran has the motive and means to carry out a cyber hack against the Trump campaign. The country wants revenge for Trump’s 2020 decision to assassinate top Qods Force general, Qassem Soleimani, by missile strike as he arrived in Baghdad. In fact, Iran doesn’t seek to simply eliminate Trump as a candidate but to eliminate him altogether. After the attempted assassination of Trump last month at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, we learned that U.S. intelligence agencies had detected an Iranian plot to kill the former president. On Aug. 6, a Pakistani man with ties to Iran was arrested by the FBI on charges of plotting to assassinate  a U.S. official not yet publicly identified. Second, what are the reasons to doubt that the documents were hacked by Iran? Despite all the evidence pointing to Iran, we don’t yet have the proverbial smoking gun, or laptop, in the hands of an Iranian operative. That kind of evidence may come soon, but in the interim, we might ask what else could have happened here? After all, the fruits of a successful state-sponsored malware attack against a presidential nominee ending up in the hands of a solely digital political newsroom might seem a bit, well, weird. And, while Politico may have been figuring out what to do with its unsolicited “gift,” whoever had possession of the documents may have grown impatient and forwarded it to the more traditional influencer, The Washington Post. Could someone within the Trump campaign have leaked the documents, and why? Well, a document containing potentially injurious details on the fledgling vice presidential pick could bolster calls for his ouster. Trump can’t like the fact that he has had to increasingly defend his choice of Vance. At least one former Trump staffer insists that Trump has to replace Vance, who has already been labeled a “historically unpopular pick.” Two things can be true at the same time. Iran is intent on interfering with our next election. Yet, could it also be true that, having been warned by Microsoft of the Iranian threat, someone with the Trump campaign decided to leverage that knowledge and leak some embarrassing data about Vance, then blame Iran? We don’t yet know the timing of Microsoft’s notification to Iran’s target, but we know Microsoft started spotting Iran’s efforts against the campaign in June. The hack, or appearance thereof, also allows Trump to play the victim — a role he seems to relish. If things don’t go his way in November, don’t be surprised if Trump blames Iran, the U.S. Intelligence Community, Politico and The Washington Post for his demise. Third, why should we care? Word of the Iran hacking allegation immediately triggered a tsunami of skepticism and even outright rejection of the claim across social media. The disbelief is understandable. Trump is a polished pro at lies and deceit, and the public, even when equipped with the latest intelligence on Iran’s cyber efforts, knows it can’t take anything Trump says at face value. The U.S. intelligence community is feverishly working to thwart foreign power attempts to disrupt our election. The FBI said it was “aware of the media reporting” on the Trump campaign incident, but declined to comment. That’s why I’m calling on the Trump campaign to fully cooperate with any FBI investigation of the alleged Iranian attack, if it isn’t cooperating already. The FBI should be as transparent as possible with its findings — given the constraints of classified details — as quickly as possible. If our intelligence agencies determine that Iran really did compromise the campaign of a major party's presidential nominee, and we’ve reached the point where we’re so distrustful that we can’t rally against a foreign adversary’s attack on our processes, the adversary wins. We know that the Department of Justice is already reticent to do anything that might affect the outcome of an election this close to Election Day, even including the opening of a counterintelligence or criminal investigation “related to politically sensitive individuals and entities.” But, not letting us know if a nominee — any nominee — has or has not been allegedly attacked by a foreign power may have the unintended consequence of depriving us of information we need to assess before we vote."
Trump's false claims about A.I. crowd photos are incredibly ironic,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 10:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ai-photos-harris-crowd-false-claims-rcna166229,"Seemingly stumped in efforts to stem the energy surrounding Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Donald Trump is asking voters not to believe what they can see with their own eyes. In social media posts shared Sunday, Trump falsely accused the Harris campaign of using artificial intelligence to generate images of large crowds at her events. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. He continued, saying, “She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the ‘crowd’ looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches. This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING.” To be clear: the crowds were real. The Truth Social post included an image from a Detroit-area airport rally that drew thousands of people, as NBC News reported. And while Trump said there was “nobody at the plane” when she arrived, you can see her being greeted by a large crowd as she steps off her plane in footage captured by NBC News. You can also see an image of her plane being welcomed by a large crowd here. And a Getty photographer confirmed the large crowd to The Daily Beast. Trump is no stranger to getting crowd sizes wrong. He's notoriously obsessed with inflating the crowds at his own events. And his claim that Harris was waving at nobody is particularly rich considering he's the one who has been captured in a video appearing to wave at nonexistent crowds in footage his campaign has shared to give the impression he’s immensely popular. It's also ironic that Trump is claiming that Harris is sharing A.I.-generated images for political gain when he and his followers have done just that. In one example, he used his social media platform to share an image that appeared to depict him praying in a church, only for the image to be called out as fake after people noticed he had six fingers on both hands. And Trump’s followers have shared other A.I.-generated images depicting him around Black people to give the impression he’s popular among Black folks. So his claims about Harris fit his pattern of accusing other people of doing things he has himself already done. But they also suggest his desperation over Harris’ apparent popularity is growing, as is his seemingly increasing public detachment from reality and his insistence that followers join him in undermining faith in democracy.  If he can convince his supporters that the photographs are fake, it's a short step to convincing them that any votes for her in November are bogus, too."
"‘And really, THAT song?’: Céline Dion rebukes Trump’s use of ‘Titanic’ anthem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 8:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/celine-dion-titanic-song-trump-rally-rcna166211,"Céline Dion has joined the long list of musicians who have rebuked the use of their music at Donald Trump’s campaign events. After a video of Dion performing her hit song “My Heart Will Go On” was shown at Trump’s rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday, the Canadian singer expressed her disapproval in a statement posted on X. “Today, Celine Dion’s management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc., became aware of the unauthorized usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at a Donald Trump / JD Vance campaign rally in Montana,” Dion posted.  “In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use. …And really, THAT song?” The romantic ballad, released as the theme to the 1997 film “Titanic,” is an odd choice for a political rally, as campaigns generally avoid imagery of sinking ships. The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris took note of the irony, posting a video of the song playing at the rally with the caption, “Trump campaign plays the theme from the Titanic at his rally.”  The song was in keeping with Trump's more unorthodox approach to campaign music, which ranges from the usual patriotic anthems such as Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” to unexpected picks such as the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and musical theater numbers from “The Phantom of the Opera.” That wide-ranging taste has also gotten Trump in trouble. Since 2016, many prominent musicians have disavowed Trump’s use of their music at his campaign events  — so many, in fact, that there’s a Wikipedia page titled “Musicians who oppose Donald Trump’s use of their music.” Dion reportedly turned down an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration in 2017."

To illuminate the upshot of the pick strategically, Former Senator Claire McCaskill is joined by guest co-host David Jolly, former Congressman of Florida’s 13th District. The pair analyze the shifting dynamics in the race, which had been Trump’s to lose, and why Harris has been underestimated in the past. Then, they’re joined by Politico’s politics bureau chief Jonathan Martin, who attended Walz’ debut in Philadelphia, to glean what he brings to the ticket and how the Trump campaign is responding.   Also, a note to our listeners: Claire’s good friend and co-host here on ‘How To Win’, Jennifer Palmieri, has moved on from our MSNBC and podcast family to join the Harris-Walz campaign. She’ll be taking her wisdom and expertise to literally sort out how to win this fall. We love you Jen, and we wish you all the best!   Want to listen to this show without ads?

Claire McCaskill: Hello, and welcome to “How to Win 2024”. It’s Thursday morning, August 8th. I’m Claire McCaskill. And I’m here with my guest co-pilot today, former Florida Congressman David Jolly. Hey, David, it’s great to be with you. David Jolly: I’m so excited to be with you. My only fear is you’re going to lose a lot of listeners by replacing Jen with me for a week. That’s terrible news. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I know. And let’s talk about that just for a minute. Before we get in today’s show, I want to share the news that my amazing co-host here on “How To Win,” Jen Palmieri, has moved on from our family at MSNBC in this podcast to actually join the Harris campaign. So she’s going to take her wisdom and her good humor and her expertise to literally sort out how to win in 2024. We love you Jen and we wish you all the best. And we hope to have you back to say hello between now and the election. Go get them. And now onto today’s episode, the countdown continues. Today marks 89 days to the election and Vice President Kamala Harris is officially the democratic nominee. So David and I want to break down the latest from her campaign, how she’s doing and why she’s been underestimated. And also, how Trump seems to be flailing. I mean, flailing, what was once his race to lose. And Jonathan Martin is going to join us to talk about the excitement around the VP pick. The teacher, the coach, the veteran, the governor, Tim Walz, and what he brings to the campaign. But first, we’re going to go to the strategy session. We do this David, where we talk about, if we were in the room, what would we be advising? What would we be telling the campaign that we think they ought to do? And so let’s talk about first of all, what do you think they’re doing right and what do you think they’re doing wrong? David Jolly: I think if you’re vice president, keep doing what you’re doing. You’re doing everything right, right now. I mean, it is a remarkable chapter in her candidacy. You know, I think one thing that she needs to address, which we’ll talk about with Jonathan is this issue of not sitting down for an interview yet. Look, she’s been very busy. There’s been a lot going on in the vice president’s world so, it’s understandable she hasn’t sat down for an interview, but kind of that Lester Holt conversation that the country needs to see, when is that going to happen? And then I think the other curiosity I have is we are a nation that is watching a lot of global conflicts, and we play a leadership role in each of them from Ukraine to the Middle East, but also some tinder boxes elsewhere. You know, the vice president has four years of great experience working on national security issues with Joe Biden. What will she demonstrate with her voice and her ticket about her leadership on the world stage? I think those are two open matters for her, but they’re not detracting from anything right now. I think it’s just what’s coming up next. But as for right now, keep doing what you’re doing because you’re winning this race doing what you’re doing. Claire McCaskill: If I were in the room, I would tell them to try to continue to bang on Republicans for Harris. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: They got a pretty good swing at that this week. As somebody who knows most of the people well that are part of the Republicans for Harris group, what else can they be doing? And do you think they got a chance of getting pins? Give us your take on that. David Jolly: I don’t think that no, I don’t actually. And this is where there’s a lot of euphoria around Vice President Harris right now and there should be. But the reality is you’re down the line Republicans like Pence and others. A lot of these former senators are still looking to save the Republican party, and they can’t do that if they actively support Vice President Harris. But the fact that they’re staying out, the fact that they’re not supporting Trump, you can ask hard questions about that decision itself, but it is a hard reflection on Donald Trump. And I think what this Republicans for Harris speaks to most importantly, is the coalition that’s available to Vice President Harris. You and I, Claire, talked about this at one point a few weeks ago, whether or not the Biden coalition instantly transfers and the Biden coalition is a little different, right? That was the soul of America coalition. That was four or five years in the making the Harris coalition now includes this entirely new energized wing from young people to voters of color, to the people you see at the rally in Atlanta and Philadelphia, that’s a different coalition than the Biden coalition. So I think if there’s an opportunity for the vice president to reach out and grow even more, it is in groups like this Republican for Harris and others that may have felt more natural being a part of the Biden coalition. People that would also vote for a Claire McCaskill, for instance. Claire McCaskill: Right. I think there are maybe five or six of those people still out there. I don’t know. So what about this Elon Musk thing and Trump? Should the Harris campaign just ignore all that? The Peter Thiel and the Elon Musk and these billionaires that are frankly behaving. I don’t even understand how crazy these guys are. Should they be paying any attention to that? And they don’t even need to worry about money at this point, right? I mean, I think Harris is in a commanding position in terms of raising money, low-dollar donations in amounts that this country’s never seen before. David Jolly: Yeah. I, I love that question. I’m curious your take on this as well, Claire, because you brought up money. I would say largely when it comes Trump, Elon and others, you can ignore most of what they say because the country sees it for what it is. Either it’s biblical truth for certain voters or it’s nonsensical for others. But I do think the two areas you have to pay attention to are money and misinformation and how do you quickly address those. On money, as you said, look, she’s going to be just fine it appears going toe to toe. The misinformation piece is really scary because we saw in Donald Trump over the past eight years and certainly in 2020, his willingness to create and use misinformation. And now, you have partners out there in the world particularly controlling platforms like X willing to do it as well. Is it your responsibility as a candidate to address the misinformation or to just out, you know, volume that misinformation? What’s your take on that? Claire McCaskill: I think it is very important that she keep the advantage she appears to have right now online. And the advantage her side has online is it so organic. And I mean, I have young people in my life that all they do is get their information from TikTok. I’m not proud of that, but it is what it is. And they tell me that the change in TikTok is remarkable over the last two or three weeks that it has gone from being dominated by a lot of misinformation, to a lot of stuff that is good for Harris and Walz. And as long as that’s occurring, I know they’re tracking that at the campaign. I think they’re going to be okay. If that gets back into an imbalance situation, that’s when the misinformation really has a chance to take root. And that’s when they’ve got to aggressively put some money behind correcting the misinformation. I think what they’re doing so far, you know, I saw her first bio ad by the campaign during the Olympics last night. It’s very good. There’s been a PAC running ads. I mean, if I’m seeing ads in Missouri, they’re seeing them everywhere in the country. David Jolly: Right. Claire McCaskill: Because I can assure you, they are not buying ads in Missouri. So, they’re not that dumb. They are buying ads obviously in the swing states heavily, but they’re also doing some national ads, which I think is brilliant. I think the idea that they’re spending some money on national ads makes sense. And you know, so far, I don’t know what the ads look like online in terms of misinformation or on the more traditional channels on the swing states. But so far, I don’t think anything they’re pitching is being caught by the American public. David Jolly: That’s right. Claire McCaskill: I think they’re in a pretty good place on the misinformation. I am scared about Elon Musk because when he tweets that Kamala Harris is a communist, you know -- David Jolly: Some people believe it, right? Claire McCaskill: -- some people actually believe it and it’s just so irresponsible. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I’m ashamed to say I used to own a Tesla. David Jolly: Hey Claire, let me ask you a question coming off of this week, the Walz announcement, the momentum continues for the vice president. At least in my words, I think you probably agree she’s doing everything right. This is just a remarkable campaign on jet fuel right now. I see two scenarios conflicting in my own analysis. One is kind of what I just described. That it almost feels like this race is over. That if this race is something beyond ideology, if it’s actually about what direction are we going? Are we all rowing in the same boat? Are we rooting for America or rooting against it? Who are we? Are we willing to tolerate racist language and racial undertones? Or are we actually better than that as a country? It almost feels like this coalition emerged that now is unstoppable, right? That’s one scenario that I think is really feasible. We might actually be in that scenario. The other scenario is, and I want to ask Jonathan about this, bring the enthusiasm back down a little bit and realize maybe America didn’t change two weeks ago. It probably didn’t. Are we still just a 50-50 race? And is this still Donald Trump’s to lose or has the ground truly shifted among the American electorate? Those are two competing scenarios. How do you see it? Claire McCaskill: Well, I am guilty of being an optimist. I am guilty of continuing to believe in this country. I am guilty of believing that a lot of the 50-50. I’m not saying it was ever 60-40, but I think it’s probably closer to 55-45 on the side of optimism, opportunity, positive things, not grievance and you know, appealing to the lowest common denominator playing to the cheap seats. So I actually think that a lot of the 50-50 was in fact people who were worried about Joe Biden’s ability to be president at his age. And I think we’re not talking about how that has played in this. David Jolly: Right. Claire McCaskill: The sense of relief that people had that are not Democrats or Republicans, that really don’t like Trump, really don’t like him, that they couldn’t really get comfortable with the idea that somebody that old was going to have that big a job. And I think that it’s not just that she’s done a great campaign. It is that sense of relief that she’s really bounced. I pay a lot of attention to the cross tabs on independence because I lived and died by independence. David Jolly: Right. Right. Claire McCaskill: I never would’ve got elected statewide in Missouri without winning independence. So I focus on that and the independence have really popped. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know, when you moved independence 10 points in two weeks that says a lot about Kamala Harris, but it also says a lot about how worried people were about Joe Biden’s age. David Jolly: No, that’s right, Claire. And I actually think for Donald Trump, and I really mean this, the spark is gone. I mean, I use the analogy or a metaphor, whichever one it is of relationship that started eight years ago based on a spark, based on something that people just felt, and they don’t feel it anymore. That spark is gone. And you know it well as anybody, as a practitioner of politics, when you’ve got the momentum, you’ve got the spark, people want to be a part of it. They want to be with a winner, right? That’s the Harris campaign right now, Donald Trump’s the losing campaign that was eight years ago. Claire McCaskill: Charlie Sykes coined the best term of all for Donald Trump’s campaign right now. He’s in the fat Elvis stage of his career. David Jolly: I know. It’s perfect. Claire McCaskill: It’s just perfect. People are tired of him. People are really tired of him. David Jolly: Yeah, that’s right. Claire McCaskill: Before we get to our guest, II got to mention the bear, the dead bear, the dead bear carcass in the back of the van. You know, when you really think about the story he told, RFK telling Roseanne Barr, I mean, this is like a “Saturday Night Live” skit. I’m sure it will be. You know that he was falconing or hawking or something and a dead bear and it ended up in his car. And then he had to go to Luger’s for a fancy steak dinner and no time for a shower. And he had his hand inside the bear’s bloody mouth and then he thinks it’s a good idea, but he drops by Central Park and happens to have a bike in the car. And then somehow the bike and the bear end up in the park and then he ends up to going to Luger’s. And then he is got to get to the airport. And you know, I mean, Tim Miller did a hysterical bit with Sam Stein on this, you know, as an assassination type moment by moment analysis of the tape of him explaining this. I mean, this guy is going to end up at 1 percent. I predict he’ll end up at 1 percent David Jolly: And there’ll be 1 percent from Trump because here’s what I’ll tell you from his vaccine denialism to a dead bear, RFK, Jr. keeps doing everything possible to take voters from Donald Trump. Claire McCaskill: Exactly. David Jolly: He’s not taking voters from Kamala Harris. Claire McCaskill: They love the dead bear. They love skinning a dead bear and eating bear meat. I know those people. We have a bunch of them in Missouri. And there’s nothing wrong with it. Nothing wrong with it. You can hunt and skin and eat bear meat all you want as long as it’s legal. I would not be recommending dumping the carcass in Central Park, however. All right. We’ll pause here. Up next, “Politico’s” politics bureau chief Jonathan Martin joins us to give us take on Governor Tim Walz after seeing his debut with Vice President Harris. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. My co-host former Congressman of Florida’s 13th congressional district, David Jolly, is still with me. So David, after a couple of weeks of veep vetting by Vice President Harris and her team, we have emerged with coach put that one first, veteran, put that one second, teacher, and then like a little bitty letters, Congressman and governor -- David Jolly: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- Tim Walz as her choice. After a kickoff Tuesday in Philly, they hit a Midwest tour of Wisconsin in Michigan. Jonathan Martin was there in Philly as Coach Walz was introduced to voters and he joins us now. He’s the politics bureau chief and senior political columnist at “Politico.” And previously, Jonathan was the national political correspondent for “The New York Times.” He’s also the co-author of “The New York Times” bestseller, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future,” which focused on the 2020 election and its aftermath. Welcome, Jonathan. And by the way, it’s not in his biography, but he’s like in everybody’s ear. He’s kind of obnoxious. Like no matter what’s going on, I usually hear from Jonathan, and I know he only has about 400 people like me. This is a guy who has tentacles that are constantly squirming out there in the world of politics, pulling in all the little creatures he can into his world. So he knows more than everybody else. Jonathan Martin: Oh, Lord. Claire McCaskill: And he is very hard to say no to. I mean, because you know, he’s kind of Midwest nice, like Coach Walz. David Jolly: I love it. Claire McCaskill: So welcome, Jonathan. Jonathan Martin: Of all the Introductions I’ve ever had, that is the most recent as the old joke goes. No, that is high praise. Senator, thank you so much for that compliment. I’m quite vivid, but I’m grateful to be on the pod. Thank you for having me. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. It’s nice of you to come. Okay, so you talked about the kickoff in Philly with the headline Harris chooses comfort food, will America bite? And I’ve been calling him mac and cheese in a trip to the hardware store. So we’re thinking the same way. Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: Give us your bottom-line takeaways. Jonathan Martin: I think the far-right and the far-left were so wrong about this pick. She didn’t snub Shapiro because he’s Jewish and she didn’t pick Walz because she was suddenly taken with the righteousness of the Palestinian cause and wanted to stand up to the sort of centrist of the Democratic Party and show her like diehard left-wing roots. Both those lines are BS. She picked him, Walz, because she had a personal connection with him. She had chemistry with somebody who’s the same age as her, who I think frankly is kind of an upper Midwest version of Doug Emhoff. He’s an affable, decent normal guy who she could connect with. And also frankly, Claire, who wasn’t going to overshadow her, who was a compliment to her. And I think that that had everything to do with this. And by the way, that debut in Philly, I think vindicated her assessment because it shows Shapiro’s chops and the how Shapiro could in fact, overshadow her. And it demonstrated how Walz I think is a good compliment to her, classic Midwestern, small town teacher, coach, veteran with a liberal California prosecutor. It makes sense. And so I think that was her thinking and I think, you know, so far proven to be right. David Jolly: Hey Jonathan, can we jump on the Philly -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- event for a minute because we saw Josh Shapiro with all of his -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah, exactly. David Jolly: -- and all of his loyalties, right? I mean, what’s amazing is all of the contenders for vice president really stuck together, even hosted rallies without Harris leading into the event. At the same time, he didn’t have a choice, right? He had to be. Had he not been there, it would’ve been a story. Jonathan Martin: Yes. David Jolly: And so he was there with five days to go the Harris-Walz ticket, watched Shapiro, working the Keystone state, very hard, going through Pennsylvania to win this thing. Do you see any daylight coming out of this? Some of the reporting that well, Shapiro, this is a perfect situation for him because now he can support the ticket, but not be tied to it. This is an ambitious governor who one day wants to run for the White House. You were in the room. What’s your read on the energy there? Jonathan Martin: I think it would’ve been a difficult relationship between the two of them if they had won because they’re so damn similar, right? They’re hard charging coastal lawyers and, I think it would’ve been scorpions in a bottle, frankly. And I think that sort of makes sense. Now, look, let’s not pretend like Tim Walz is somehow some shy and retiring figure. He said the right things during his interview with her and said he wanted to be helpful however he could. He had no greater ambitions. Give me a break. Okay. He’s a congressman turned two-term governor. He has plenty of ambition. He just knows what to say in the right places. But don’t tell me that Tim Walz wouldn’t love to be president one day, okay, because I’m sure he would. You don’t do that job if you don’t have at least some inkling on running for president yourself. But look, if you’re Shapiro, the ticket wins this fall. You’re probably going to be a two-term Democratic governor of a really (inaudible) state, unless something happens in 2026, and he loses his re-elect. And then you’re looking at 2030, and he’s still going to be a fairly young guy at the doorstep of 60 by then and could certainly run for president in ‘32. So that’s a long ways away. And obviously, if Harris loses this fall, Shapiro’s going to be top of the list, David, for ‘28. David Jolly: Yeah. And I asked that very quickly, Claire, because what has been amazing since all of the conversation around Biden to now is how all of the principles leading principles in today’s Democratic Party have kind of done everything, right? We talk about how Harris has done everything, right. But you know, Harris’ VP stuck with Biden, defended Biden. Walz was the Democratic Governors Association spokesperson who walked out of the White House and said we’re with Joe. And then as it all shifted and Harris was the presumptive nominee, all of these key players with their own ambitions also rallied around the vice president. It’s been a really remarkable moment for democratic unity. Jonathan Martin: Nothing focuses the mind like the thread of a political hanging, right. David, I mean. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. You know, I will tell you that I was in a weird, weird position for two weeks. David, as you know, painfully, we were on panels together where I was meekly, but affirmatively stating in every way I could, other than he must drop out that we had a problem, and it had to be addressed. And what I knew that a lot of people didn’t know is how furiously people were working behind the scenes in ways that were productive. And I will just say this, and I don’t know if Jonathan Martin will agree with me, but Chuck Schumer doesn’t get enough credit. He really doesn’t. Chuck Schumer was doing everything that he needed to do, including saying all the right things publicly, doing all the right things privately, getting all the battleground states polling done about a week out so they had that data. And it’s a blessing curse, but in this instance, a blessing that we have real Senate races in every single state that she has to win. So, yeah, I’m proud of the democratic leadership and how this has all come through. And I think the reasons Jonathan gave for her picking him are exactly right. He augments her. He doesn’t mirror her. And you know, I will say, I think maybe the only person who might be slightly disappointed is Amy Klobuchar. Jonathan Martin: Your classmate. Claire McCaskill: I know. I know because this makes her path forward a little difficult because I think we all know she would like to run again someday, but she’s close friends with Tim Walz and I know she’s enthusiastic about him being vice president. Jonathan Martin: Claire, it’s good that you mentioned Schumer because of course, Schumer was one of the fathers of the class of 2006. He was one of the architects of that democratic wave that year that elected you, that elected Tim Walz, obviously, to the House, but elected Amy Klobuchar to the Senate. And yes, elected the two most vulnerable sitting senators, Sherrod Brown and John Tester whose faith this fall depends in part on Kamala Harris and Tim Walz running a strong campaign because you know, they can survive the top of the ticket losing to their states, but they can’t survive a debacle on the top of the ticket. So all roads lead back to the class of 2006, at least when it comes to the politics of 2024. I think you’re right on Chuck. I mean, he obviously went out to Rehoboth, to Biden’s summer house and had a clearly frank and candid conversation as they say diplomatic circles. And I think everybody in politics knew that if Biden had not dropped out that Sunday afternoon, then Schumer and Pelosi and Hakeem Jeffries were going to be forced to take extreme measures that coming week and by extreme measures, I mean probably having to go public to some degree, demanding Biden drop out. Biden took the sort of better part of valor and made it a sort of difficult month, slightly easier on himself, still humiliating. But obviously, it could have gotten a lot worse that week. And I do think Schumer and company were going to have to go further if Biden hadn’t dropped out. Claire McCaskill: Do you think they made a mistake in Philly not mentioning Joe Biden’s name? Jonathan Martin: I do. Yeah. I think that would’ve been a nice touch on the top of the VP’s remarks to have tipped a hat to him. Let’s be honest. Philadelphia is basically Biden’s backyard. It’s his de facto sort of major Metro areas. Campaign was based there in 2020. His wife is from there. It would’ve been a nice touch. I got to thank Claire that she’ll use her acceptance speech in Chicago to do a nice homage to Biden, but you’re right, missed opportunity in Philly. David Jolly: So Jonathan, let me ask you a question. This is where my political coalition, if you will, now that I’m out of office as an independent -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- is I ally with the democratic coalition though I’m not one. And so that’s also where on this matter, I was a little more quick to just accept the direction it was going until I was told it was going another direction. Claire much more experienced at the backroom dealings on some of this stuff. But if you look at this Harris-Walz ticket and how it’s setting up, I do wonder if there are vulnerabilities around national security at a time when there are wars breaking out in the world, the Middle East really is a tinder box that could change tomorrow. You do have two candidates in Harris and Walz with experience, with national security chops. Obviously, the sitting vice president with her four years. Walz with his career as a National Guardsman and all the work he’s done on behalf of veterans as well. I realize it’s not the most poll tested issue right now, but it’s one of those issues that kind of has to get attended to. Do you see the Harris-Walz ticket being able to address some of the concerns about global unrest or do you see them really getting to find in a Clinton-Gore domestic policy way and who chooses how they get defined? Jonathan Martin: Let me answer that, two ways, David. One, I think if we do have a wider war in the Middle East or some kind of God forbid, either breakout of hostilities in the Pacific in the next 80 days, then I think we’re going to see that question come front and center, who’s better suited to be commander-in-chief. You know, absent that, I think this is much more of a referendum on do you want Donald Trump back in office? Which frankly has been the defining question of American politics for nine years now, which is Donald Trump, which side are you on? It reminds me of like a modern, smaller scale, more limited version of the civil war in America for decades after the civil war in American politics. The only question was which side of the war were you on? And then nothing else really mattered, right? And like, you’re a great example of this. You were Republican Congressman from Florida, but obviously, you just can’t be for the Trump party anymore because that’s the defining question. It’s not right and left. It’s not issue based. It’s are you forward against Trump? I still think that’s central in some kind of a major national security conflict or the sort of mushrooming of the current conflicts going on. Lastly, I’ll just say this. I think Trump is going to use their debate if they do have one, I think it looks like that that they will, to say something along the lines of, you know, the world leaders, Putin or whatever, they’re not going to be scared of you. They’re going to laugh at you. David Jolly: Right. Jonathan Martin: I mean, I think that’s going to be one of Trump’s major lines of attack is to say that you can’t be commander-in-chief, that the world leaders wouldn’t take you seriously, right? And I’ll be really curious to see what her response is because she’s got to know that that’s coming, right? Claire McCaskill: I can’t wait. Okay. So next up, speaking of how Trump and Vance are handling this new ticket. Jonathan Martin: Not well. Claire McCaskill: We’re going to talk about that on the other side and what the polling trends look like. Back with David jolly and Jonathan Martin in just a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Okay. Welcome back. Former Republican and former Florida, Congressman David Jolly and I have been speaking with Jonathan Martin, who is the political politics bureau chief and senior political columnist. Let’s talk about Trump and the GOP’s reaction to the Walz pick specifically. It really seems really weak. And I got to tell you, that thing that he did yesterday, Vance, his instincts are not good. David Jolly: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: That running down the tarmac to like somebody in high school going, oh, yeah, that’s going to be my plane someday and, oh, she’s not answering questions. I mean, it looks so bush league. It did not look anywhere close to leader. I know he is trying to emulate, you know, tricks that Trump would do, but what’s your take on how these guys have tried to frame this race and how they fail to frame this race. Jonathan Martin: There’s a saying, as you know, Claire in politics about, you know, living off the land and when you don’t have a coherent singular message, you tend to live off the land. So when the stock market crashes on Monday, you’re living off of the Kamala crash. The economy’s going to hell on the hand basket. Oh, well there was a recovery on Wall Street, Tuesday, never mind. Okay, and now we’ll focus on Kamala is not answering questions from the press. So we’ll go over on the tarmac. It’s reflective of the lack of a consistent, straightforward message. It’s the economy, stupid, hope and change, compassionate conservatism, you know, restoring the soul of America. If you don’t have a coherent, straightforward bumper sticker pitch, then you’re going to be living with whatever the news cycle gives you day in, day out. Claire McCaskill: Like we won’t go back. Jonathan Martin: There you go. David Jolly: I actually would not be surprised Claire and Jonathan, if Trump tries to swap out J.D. Vance. Claire McCaskill: Really. David Jolly: I realize it’s really late and I realize there’s ballot type. Here’s why. This is a former president who fired senior officials by tweet. Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: Right? When he’s done with somebody he’s done. He also knows, the one thing he knows is showmanship is grabbing a news cycle. He’s smart enough to know that the vice president and Governor Walz have all the momentum right now, all of it. And the Trump campaign is in a free fall, and nothing is working for him. He has to have a reset. I really think he is in a free fall. And where does he get that reset? He’s not capable of changing kind of the racial undertones or outright racist language. He’s not capable of stopping the insults. The one thing he can do is try to create some type of news story for a couple weeks around swapping that. Jonathan Martin: Yeah. I’m really curious what he says if there’s news conference of Mar-a-Lago. But my instinct is that if he does make a change, it would probably be with his staff rather than Vance just because changing your VP pick is so much more disruptive and convulsive to the campaign. David Jolly: But we’re talking about Trump. Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: So Jonathan, let me ask you though a question following up on this because I do think in the horse race analysis, Trump’s in a free fall. Harris has all the momentum, they’re doing everything, right? So among democratic activists and voters and democratic allies, there’s a bit of a high right now that, wow, this is going to last. We’re going to win this thing. It’s over. This race is over. Fundamentally though, we know America didn’t change two weeks ago just because Biden stepped out -- Jonathan Martin: Right. David Jolly: -- and Harris stepped in. And you could argue the race is still Donald Trump’s to lose, but he’s just doing the things to lose it right now. Jonathan Martin: Yes. David Jolly: As a seasoned journalist, how do you read the room nationally on where this race really is? Jonathan Martin: A very competitive race. It’s an evenly divided country when you look at the Electoral College. Look, Trump is forever going to be a 46 to 47 percent plurality. He’s not going to sniff a majority in this country, but he doesn’t have to, like, we don’t have a popular vote. So yeah, it’s still a really close race because the map structurally tends to be stronger for today’s Republican coalition. It’s easier for them to find past to 270. And yeah, you’re asking the country to support a California liberal, which is not an easy ask, right? This is not Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp on top of the ticket. So it is tough when you go into places like Wisconsin and Michigan. It’s not impossible, but obviously, is not easy. I think Harris is going to need a lot of help from Trump. I think you’re right, David. I think Trump is capable of losing this race more than Harris is capable of winning it, you know? And he may do just that. Claire McCaskill: Well, I’m going to disagree with you a little bit there. Jonathan Martin: Please. Claire McCaskill: I actually believe, and you and I may have talked about this before, but I don’t think people appreciate the jungle that is California primary races. I don’t think people appreciate how hard it is as a Democrat to emerge, first to be the D.A. of San Francisco and then to be attorney general of California and then to become United States Senator. I mean, California is bigger than most countries and there are lots and lots of people who want to be what Kamala Harris has been in California. She is particularly good at this. And I think what happened to her is that her presidential race -- Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: -- did not go well for a lot of -- Jonathan Martin: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- complicated reasons that they’ll probably be several books written about now. Jonathan Martin: Yes. Claire McCaskill: And then her first two years in the vice presidency were very rough and she was really taking it too much to heart that she was being diminished as vice president, but she has gone back to her skill set. And I watched her with those hecklers yesterday. She did really well. Her timing has been impeccable. Her choice of Walz has been impeccable. I really think she is much better at this still than people are giving her credit. I may not get it that she can lose this race, but I believe she can win this race too. Jonathan Martin: Let me say two things in response. One is I having covered her when she was the A.G. and Senator in California, you’re right. She’s more talented than her belly flop of a campaign in ‘20 and her rough couple of years in the White House show. She does have real talent. She’s proven that this week on the trail. I guess where I would push back a little bit is to say, yeah, she navigated the California thicket, but that’s a thicket that is like far-left, center-left and center. And it takes a certain level of dexterity, but you’re navigating basically everything that’s either from the center to the left. I think it’s tougher now because she’s not had the navigate places like you did, you know, go into a place like a Joplin, Missouri. That’s just not been what she’s had to do. And frankly, been ill served by the White House that has not put her in front of VFW conventions and Legion conventions but has had her doing entirely base oriented work for the last three and a half years. So she’s now got 90 days to appeal to a general election audience that she hasn’t really talked to in a long time. Claire McCaskill: I agree. I agree. And I mean, that’s a good point. I always think it’s better to have somebody on the ticket that is actually won in a state that’s hard. David Jolly: I’m very curious if we get to November and she indeed wins this thing, which I think she will actually. I think she’s going to win this race. And I think it’ll be part of Trump’s failures, but also her true talents and her hard work. I’m curious if voters elect Kamala Harris, not necessarily because we’ve had a broad ideology debate, but because they’re voting based on who we are as a country and who we want to be. There’s something bigger at play than the traditional left, right spectrum going on. Jonathan Martin: Absolutely. And Trump’s the stand in for that. David Jolly: That’s right. Jonathan Martin: It’s a, which side are you on question? Like, you know, do you find Trump to be somebody who reflects the country that you want to be a part of? It’s so much bigger than right versus left. And it’s why the Biden coalition is so precarious. I mean, because you create a coalition that includes the David Jolly’s of the world, like the Cheney family, all the way to like AOC, an actual socialist. Well, that’s a pretty ungainly coalition right there, right? It’s a powerful one because it includes like everything from, you know, Brooklyn hipsters to the Ladue country club player, but like it’s tough to sustain and it depends on Trump saying and doing crazy shit, you know? Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Well, I’m betting on it. I’m betting on the crazy shit. But before we go, I’d like your take Jonathan on, if you think this issue they’re trying to use on Walz is going to have any kind of impact whatsoever from a guy running for president that had bone spurs, this National Guard thing. Do you think this is a chance in hell of moving a number for him? Jonathan Martin: I think absent new and damning information, I’m skeptical. Look, if there are e-mails or if there are recordings of Walz talking about bailing from the Guard because he got word that they were going to be deployed to combat, I think it’s a much tougher scenario. I think absent that, I don’t think it’s going to pop. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I agree. You know, I mean, and let’s remember Vance was a war correspondent, not to diminish -- Jonathan Martin: Thank you. Claire McCaskill: -- people who write for a living, J-Mart. David Jolly: Exactly. Claire McCaskill: But this is no Jim Webb. Jonathan Martin: There you go. There you go. There you go. Claire McCaskill: Okay. David, don’t you think we should get Jonathan to opine about the polling before we go? David Jolly: Oh, I agree. That’s kind of where -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- I was going because I think everything’s going right for Harris and her numbers could hit 60 at this rate and trumps could hit 40 -- Jonathan Martin: Yeah. David Jolly: -- because he’s so bad at this. And I guess that’s where the reality check from -- Jonathan Martin: Yes. David Jolly: -- from you, Jonathan. What does it take, let’s say for Trump to stop the bleeding, because if Trump doesn’t stop the bleeding, I presume you would agree, the polls don’t start to change if Trump doesn’t change his candidacy. Jonathan Martin: Yeah, which is why this debate matters and which is why I think Trump’s going to give in regardless of who broadcast it because Trump needs just like Biden did frankly this spring to change the conversation. And I think that a debate in which Kamala Harris has a bad moment or two could change the contours of this race. So, prepare America, I think we’re going to see a debate in September. David Jolly: Could I ask you very quickly on that, Jonathan, because I asked the national security question. Related to that, the Republican charge that she won’t sit down with the press. I mean, they’re really hammering on this issue that she has yet to sit down with the press. What’s your read on that as a member of the press? Jonathan Martin: Look, the longer she delays it, she just raises the stakes. If she and Walz were doing regular interviews on the campaign trail, forget national. Just do your affiliate stuff on the way, you keep the press at bay, and you lower the stakes. By doing this now it just raises, I think unwisely, it just raises the stakes for whenever they do a sit down and I don’t get why they’d want to do that. And I think frankly, it reflects a lack of confidence in the candidate. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. I think the affiliate anchors is what she should start doing, you know, 10, 15 minutes with affiliate anchors because they’re going to be, you know, as long as they don’t go to that kid in Colorado, that’s making a national name for himself. I think she would do really, really well. And frankly, I think she’ll surprise people in the interviews too. I don’t know why they’re hesitating. Jonathan Martin: She has been so much more confident this week than I’ve seen her in the three and a half years as vice president. It’s a whole new person, you know? Claire McCaskill: Okay. J-Mart, thank you so much for your time. Jonathan Martin: What a treat. Claire McCaskill: We are honored to have had you. And hopefully, we will talk to you again before we get to the end. Jonathan Martin: Would love to. Claire McCaskill: Okay. So Jonathan Martin is “Politico’s” politics bureau chief. And let me do this, don’t forget the book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump Biden and the Battle for America’s Future.” If you haven’t read it, I actually have, I don’t want to admit that to you because that’s a confession that you’ll probably use against me. I thought it was actually very, very good. So I recommend it for people who want to understand exactly what happened around 2020 and why it all matters today. So, thanks. Jonathan Martin: Thanks guys. Claire McCaskill: Yep. All right. And let do this. My guest co-pilot today, former Republican and former Florida Congressman David Jolly. Thanks for coming. David Jolly: Thank you. Claire McCaskill: Before we head out, two things. One, remember we have Tim Walz’s winning hot dish recipe in the notes for the podcast we did with him a few weeks ago.

Republicans’ 2024 case has three pillars. All three are collapsing.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 12, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-2024-election-inflation-immigration-crime-rcna165773,"Giving Donald Trump advice is much like attempting to steer a hurricane — neither will change course. Yet that hasn’t stopped Republicans from offering the former president what they think is a simple prescription to reverse Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum: Stick to the issues. Trump’s campaign “has sought to attack her on policy grounds while casting her as unfit,” reports The Washington Post. “The policy- and issue-related attacks would get more traction,” Republican pollster Neil Newhouse told The New York Times. But there’s a problem. The GOP’s policy argument against Democrats is built on three pillars: inflation, immigration and crime. Yet on all three fronts, the Republican case is collapsing. One of these pillars, crime, was admittedly in shoddy shape well before 2024. When Americans understandably worried about crime rates spiking during the pandemic, Republicans pounced on the issue. Even though crime rose in liberal- and conservative-run cities and states alike, the GOP hoped to reuse its old “soft on crime” playbook from the late 20th century to put Democrats on the back foot. Then crime rates fell in 2021 — and 2022 and 2023. Most recently, Justice Department data shows a 15% drop in violent crime in the first three months of 2024. According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the murder rate in nearly 70 large U.S. cities is down more than 8% since Trump left office. GOP attempts to run on reducing crime were always going to be complicated after their presidential nominee was convicted of 34 felony counts. But the data should make it impossible. I say “should” because for Trump, crime isn’t really about crime; it’s about Black and brown people doing crime. Crime and immigration are essentially inseparable to him — and indeed the entire right-wing media machine. And with unlawful border crossings much higher for most of President Joe Biden’s tenure than under other recent presidents, conservative attacks on immigration have gone into overdrive. So worried were Senate Democrats that earlier this year they reached a border agreement with their Republican counterparts heavily tilted toward GOP priorities. Then Trump killed the deal at the last minute anyway so he could keep campaigning on the issue. Instead, Biden issued an executive action that heavily restricted the number of asylum-seekers allowed to remain in the U.S. But even before Biden announced that new policy, unlawful crossings were already declining. Last month, the Border Patrol made 56,000 apprehensions, the lowest since the fall of 2020. “Shelters on the southern U.S. border and in some major cities that were inundated with migrants a year ago say they are seeing sharp declines in migrants seeking refuge,” reported NBC News on Friday, “some reporting drops as high as 60% in just the past few months.” How long this decline continues remains to be seen. The U.S. is counting on Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to continue that country’s stepped-up enforcement against non-Mexican immigrants trying to reach the countries’ border. And as Dara Lind wrote for MSNBC about Biden’s action soon after it was announced, “generally, a crackdown engenders a ‘wait and see’ period [among would-be migrants] of a few weeks or months,” after which “the deterrent effect fades.” Our immigration system needs a complete overhaul, including far more resources. But for the moment, Democrats will take the good news. That leaves the most important issue to voters: inflation. Sustained inflation rates not seen in years provided Biden’s greatest political obstacle aside from his age. Though polls show voters trust Harris far more than Biden on the issue, the GOP would like to change that. Republicans have wildly overstated how much fault lies with government spending, when corporate price hikes and Covid-induced supply shocks deserve far more of the blame. But they had every reason to be confident in using the issue as a cudgel against the Democrats. “You have people dying financially because they can’t buy bacon,” Trump claimed (wrongly) at his low-energy press conference Thursday. “They can’t buy food, they can’t buy groceries, they can’t do anything.” Yet even shortly after inflation’s peak, the GOP underperformed in the 2022 midterms — suggesting voters didn’t believe that electing Republicans would slow the rise in prices. With each passing month, the case has weakened: In June 2023, the annual rate of inflation dropped to 3%, where it has hovered ever since. The consumer price index dropped 0.1% between May and June, the first month-to-month decline since the pandemic. Even mortgage rates — which are not included in inflation statistics but are a key cost for millions of prospective homebuyers and sellers — hit a 15-month low last week. By itself, the declining rate of inflation might not be enough. Millions of Americans still struggle furiously to make ends meet. But Trump has further undermined his own party by refusing to walk back his calls for sweeping tariffs — 10% on all imports and 60% on Chinese-made goods. (He has even suggested using tariffs to replace income taxes.) Economists on both the left and right say these tariffs would only exacerbate inflation. Add it all together, and the GOP case on inflation has become as laughable as the idea that Trump has ever done his own grocery shopping. Not since the early years of the Great Depression has news cut so uniformly against one party’s case for power. Republicans’ best hope was that the former president could win the same way he did in 2016: in spite of himself. With roughly three months to go, there’s still time for some news event to change matters, as Jim Comey’s letter did in 2016. But as of now, real-world trends won’t save Trump. Given his tenuous relationship to reality, that’s entirely appropriate."
Brittney Griner’s Olympic story is a real-life hero’s journey,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 11, 2024, 10:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/brittney-griner-gold-medal-basketball-team-usa-rcna165817,"Brittney Griner had a moment while standing on the medal podium after she and Team USA defeated France 67-66 in a nail-biting Olympic gold medal game. She let all of the tears pour out of her while she listened to “The Star-Spangled Banner” and watched the United States’ flag rise to the top of the rafters. She stood tall with a gold medal on her neck and her hand on her heart. USA Basketball’s women’s national team had just made history winning its eighth straight gold medal and Griner had just won her third. DeWanna Bonner, a former teammate of Griner’s and a current forward for the Connecticut Sun, had foreshadowed the moving scene that took place in Paris on Sunday for the 33-year-old Griner. “I’m pretty sure to hear that national anthem and that gold medal going around her neck is gonna mean so much more to her than probably anybody else in that arena,” Bonner told me July 19, the day before the WNBA All-Star Game. Why did winning in Paris and keeping Team USA’s dynastic gold medal streak alive mean so much for Griner? “My country literally saved my life,” she said during WNBA All-Star weekend in Phoenix before flying to Europe for her third Olympic Games. “And now I’m able to represent them again, and it just means so much more. So much more.” Two years ago, Griner couldn’t have imagined that she’d be winning a gold medal for the U.S. or even playing basketball at all. She was still reeling from a nine-year prison sentence from Russian Judge Anna Sotnikova after she was found with two cartridges of hash oil at a Moscow airport. Griner, wrongly detained in Russia, thought she’d still be serving that full nine-year sentence. She was finally released in December 2022, after spending 293 days as a Russian prisoner, when the U.S. swapped her for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. What Griner has gone through in the past couple of years has been nothing short of a “hero’s journey” that is as extraordinary as any fable or piece of Greek mythology. It sounds too remarkable to be true, but it’s a moment in American history that shouldn’t be forgotten. Griner will leave this Olympics as an American hero and a public servant not just for what she did on the court during the United States’ six-game Olympic run, but also for how she has influenced the United States off the court. What makes an American hero? Sacrifice of self, cultural influence and service to community, according to journalist Antonio Olivo. Let’s see how Griner fits the bill. While Griner was detained, and after she returned to the U.S., she and her wife, Cherelle, raised substantial awareness across the U.S. about what the families of wrongfully detained Americans go through. The partnership that the Griners have with the Bring Our Families Home campaign was instrumental in making sure there was pressure on the White House not to forget about the other Americans detained abroad. On Aug. 1, she and Cherelle were transported back to 2022 when they heard the news that President Joe Biden had pulled off yet another prisoner swap and brought home Americans Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva. They got the news just as Griner and Team USA were about to play Belgium in the group stage. “It’s a great day,” Griner said after Team USA won that game 87-73. “Head over heels happy for the families right now. Any day that Americans come home is a win.” Before the 2024 Paris Olympics, Griner talked to NBC News’ Liz Kreutz, who asked her what she wanted people watching the Olympics to know about her. “That BG is locked in and ready to go,” Griner replied. “I’m happy. I’m in a great place, I’m representing my country, the country that fought for me to come back. And I’m going to represent well.” Griner has represented well but not in the typical way that WNBA fans are used to. On what is the hardest basketball team in the world to make, Griner didn’t start for Team USA in the Olympics and averaged around 14 minutes per game while averaging 7.3 points per game. She wasn’t the No. 1 option, but that doesn’t mean she didn’t make an impact. When A’ja Wilson’s shots weren’t falling, Griner would position herself to get the putback. When Team Nigeria’s top scorer, Ezinne Kalu, picked off a pass meant for Griner, the 6-foot-9 center with a 7-foot, 3.5-inch wingspan didn’t stop. She ran as fast as she could and blocked Kalu’s layup on the other end. Griner thrived doing the little things rather than every play being run through her. Heroes don’t consciously think of themselves and don’t stray from their sense of commitment. Overseas for the first time since being wrongfully detained, Griner put her teammates and the fans who graciously sought her autograph above herself. In an interview before Team USA’s semifinal game against Australia on Friday, head coach Cheryl Reeve touched on how Griner always makes time for the people around her. “I think that the reception that she gets and the warmth that she feels for her is something that is incredibly meaningful that she’ll always remember,” Reeve said. “I think what she went through we all sort of haven’t forgotten. … It’s a part of her every day. That will never leave her.” American heroes make major impacts on the nation, on society and in their communities. In addition to raising awareness about a political issue that wasn’t previously getting enough attention in the news, Griner’s presence and desire to tell her story affects young women all over, and especially young women who don’t fit feminine stereotypes. “Women come in all different shapes and sizes, all different packages, and so for her to share that, regardless of what people say or what people see, she is just a different brand of woman,” said Jonquel Jones, a friend of Griner’s and a player for the New York Liberty. “I know that there’s gonna be kids out there that want to be able to see themselves in somebody like her, that can inspire so many.” Griner’s intent to serve the communities around her will continue as the WNBA’s Players Association determines if it will opt out of its current collective bargaining agreement. According to The Ringer’s Mirin Fader, Griner has taken more of an interest in working with the Players Association to help shape the future of her union, including seeking higher salaries so that WNBA players don’t have to go to other countries to make money in the league’s offseason like she did. In Griner’s most recent memoir, “Coming Home,” which details her ordeal in Russia and her adjustment back to American life, she explains that she believed she had let down her family as a result of accidentally carrying hash oil, which she’d used for the chronic pain she developed as an athlete. “The Griner name was now stained around the globe,” she wrote. “Dope head. Drug dealer. Dumb. I hurt because I knew I handed the world a weapon.” But the Griner name is anything but “stained.” It’s a name that ought to be uttered with honor. The White House should consider honoring Griner with a Presidential Medal of Freedom, a high honor that recognizes “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.” Griner has done all of the above."
