I wanted to impeach Oklahoma’s school chief last year. Now some Republicans do too.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 5:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/oklahoma-bible-public-school-mandate-rcna166602,"If ever there was a time to cue up “Ya Got Trouble” from “The Music Man,” it’s now. You might remember the slick con artist who duped a whole town into buying band instruments while scheming to run off with their money. But Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters isn’t a swindler peddling trombones — he’s a self-serving politician on a Christian nationalist crusade to dismantle public education. If the Republican supermajority in the Oklahoma Legislature doesn’t rein him in, he’ll destroy the entire public education system. Walters has consistently put his own political ambitions and divisive cultural wars ahead of the needs of students and teachers. His tenure has been defined by unconstitutional initiatives, reckless mismanagement of taxpayer dollars and a relentless focus on self-promotion. One of Walters’ more alarming moves, his push to mandate Bible instruction in every 5th through 12th grade public school classroom, went into effect with the start of school this week. That move isn’t about education but about using public schools to advance his ideological agenda. Thankfully, most large school districts have refused to implement Walters’ mandated Bible instruction citing doubts about its constitutionality. Indeed, Walters has shown little regard for the Constitution, ignoring the separation of church and state in his quest to reshape Oklahoma’s education system in his own image. His handling of taxpayer dollars has been equally troubling. Take, for example, the funds allocated for emergency asthma inhalers in schools. Walters has let those funds sit unused for over a year. In a letter to the state’s attorney general, he said he wants clarity on how to distribute the money, but he also questioned whether the money allocated to the foundation to provide the inhalers — named for a 16-year-old who died of an asthma attack —  would mean the state is showing preferential treatment to a single vendor. In short, he’s choosing to play politics instead of protecting Oklahoma’s students. That’s not just irresponsible; it’s potentially life-threatening. Democrats aren’t the only ones who are fed up. Recently, 26 Republican state representatives, almost a third of those in the state House, signed a letter demanding an investigation into Walters’ conduct. Written by Rep. Mark McBride, the letter highlights bipartisan concern over the chaos he’s caused. It also expresses unease “about the budget performance, spending priorities, and transparency” of Walters’ office and describes his treatment of state lawmakers from both parties as “unprofessional, beneath the dignity of a statewide elected official, and … contrary to the best interests of the taxpayers and students of Oklahoma.” The Republicans’ letter says Walters has failed to “comply with legislative budgetary directives,” failed to “turn over complete information surrounding the expenditure of state funds for travel,” failed to meet the requirements of the Open Records Act — “which resulted in the Attorney General threatening civil and criminal action” — and defied the “Legislature’s appropriations authority by refusing to execute required funding for critical asthma inhalers.” They say those complaints are “a non-exhaustive list of recent actions” from Walters. That significant percentage of Republicans demanding an investigation might not be enough. House Speaker Charles McCall has said he’ll only consider such a request if 51 of the 81 Republicans in the chamber sign onto the letter. Walters has dismissed his Republican critics as “moderate Republicans.” In a post on X, he wrote, “Ending porn in schools. Driving woke indoctrination out of the classroom.  Demanding accountability. The left and union lackeys call for an investigation and impeachment.  I will never stop standing for parents!” In a news release in which he accuses Walters of “gaslighting,” Oklahoma Republican state Rep. Nick Archer says “multiple elected officials have made reasonable requests regarding [Walter's] use of taxpayer funds and asked that he address critical education issues. Instead, he deflects accountability by referring to Republican legislators as ‘moderate’ individuals who are promoting ‘porn in schools.’” After pointing out that the Oklahoma Legislature is “widely considered one of the most conservative in the country,” Archer writes, “Let me be clear: neither porn nor Ryan Walters belong in Oklahoma schools.” Following his push for Bible instruction in public schools, Walters  championed the establishment of St. Isadora, which would have become the nation’s first publicly funded religious school if the Oklahoma Supreme Court hadn’t ruled against it. A year ago, when I first called for Walters’ impeachment, some dismissed it as partisan politics. But now, as the letter from Republican lawmakers illustrates, even members of his own party are beginning to see the damage he’s done and are calling for the same. Walters has consistently put his political ambitions above the needs of Oklahoma’s students, and the consequences have been disastrous. Much attention has been given to Project 2025 agenda, a far-right blueprint designed to reshape American government. But, under Walters’ supervision, Oklahoma is already serving as a testing ground for policies that aim to weaken public institutions and impose ideological agendas. What’s happening here could happen nationwide if we don’t take action. Among the many lawsuits naming Walters as a defendant, one stands out because, in that case, a judge granted a student a protection order preventing Walters from disclosing their identity. The student’s lawyers say Walters and his administration had previously done just that at a public meeting. The student is challenging the state’s discriminatory policy against altering gender designations in school records, and Walters publicly identifying them highlights how his aggressive stance on “radical gender theory” not only contradicts legal protections but also jeopardizes the safety of students. In addition to all the above, under Walters’ leadership, Oklahoma’s student performance metrics have declined, and one study ranked our state's education system the second-worst in the country. Meanwhile, monthly State Board of Education meetings have turned into battlegrounds, with parents, teachers and concerned citizens showing up in protest.  Walters has prioritized his ambitions over the well-being of the people he’s supposed to serve, weaponized religion, mismanaged public funds, and disrespected teachers and administrators across the state. The governor had to issue an executive order to force Walters to stop using taxpayer dollars to pay a PR firm tasked with making Walters look good.   Oklahoma is a test case for a far-right agenda that could rapidly spread to other states, turning public education systems across the country into battlegrounds for ideological wars. His mandate that students read the Bible shouldn’t be viewed in a vacuum. It’s a part of a much more comprehensive plan to erode the separation of church and state all over."

Donald Trump was right: The economy does do better under Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-donald-trump-economy-inflation-rcna166795,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 14 episode of ""The ReidOut."" In a 2004 interview with CNN, Donald Trump said, “The economy does better under the Democrats.”  The 2024 Republican nominee for president wasn’t wrong. And now, we have even more evidence to back up his point.  On Wednesday, we learned that inflation fell to its lowest level in more than three years. That’s not just good news for your pocketbook, it’s really good news for the Federal Reserve, which has been looking for numbers like this to justify cutting interest rates. Do you know what else we found out this week? Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has produced the most oil ever by any nation on Earth. This news is such a big deal that it seemed to trigger Trump. Late Wednesday, Trump held a “messaging event” on the economy in North Carolina.  He was supposed to lay out his economic vision for the future. Instead, he went on for more than an hour with incoherent lies about the currently booming economy and lies about the economy he left for President Joe Biden. Trump said he gave “Harris and Biden an economic miracle” that they turned into “an economic nightmare.” He then made vague promises about lowering inflation … without saying how he’d do that. “My first day back I will sign an executive order directing every Cabinet secretary and agency head to use every tool and authority to defeat inflation,” Trump said.  Then he just wouldn’t stop whining about how Harris supposedly copies him. “When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan it’ll probably be a copy of mine because basically that’s what she does,” Trump said. Trump’s rambling “messaging event” was totally disconnected from reality. Inflation is down, wage growth is outpacing price growth, and violent crime is also down. These are objective facts that don’t care about Trump’s feelings. Vice President Kamala Harris will also be in North Carolina on Friday to lay out her vision for the economy. According to Axios, she’s going to outline how she would lower costs for health care, housing and food for the middle class.  She reportedly wants to break with Bidenomics and hit rising prices head-on, making middle-class economic concerns a key focus of her campaign. Harris was boosted by a Financial Times poll that showed voters trust her more than Trump on the economy. Like Trump said in 2004, maybe voters are realizing that the economy just does better under Democrats.

Down-ballot Republicans will suffer under Donald Trump — and it's their own fault,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 2:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-down-ballot-republicans-agenda-rcna166786,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 14 episode of ""The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle."" Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, down-ballot Republicans appear to be getting nervous. Republicans are desperately trying to get former President Donald Trump to stay on message and focus on substance instead of attacking Harris for her crowd size and racial identity.  The last time I was a down-ballot Republican, I was on the ballot with Trump in 2016. So let me tell you how hard this upcoming election will be for them. The real problem here is, it’s not just that Trump is completely incapable of articulating an agenda — down-ballot Republicans really don’t have an agenda either.  This is a cycle where House Republicans have nothing to take to the American people on virtually every piece of legislation of national consequence. From raising the debt ceiling to keeping the government open to funding forces trying to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s march across Europe — it was Democrats, not Republicans, who actually led the governing coalition in Washington.  So as much as these down-ballot Republicans are rightly suffering under Trump’s listless campaign — truly one of the worst presidential campaigns we’ve seen in modern history — most Republicans have nobody to blame but themselves because they don’t have a discernible agenda either."
Donald Trump is teetering on the edge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 1:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-losing-control-kamala-harris-rcna166730,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 15 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio versus Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is literally the campaign of yesterday versus tomorrow. On Wednesday, we saw Trump deliver what was supposed to be a speech about the economy. Instead, he stood there and claimed the United States was a Third World country. I don’t know anyone who believes that.  Trump’s co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, are extremely good at what they do. But that skill doesn’t matter when it seems they have lost control of their candidate.  Trump has a tired, 20-year-old act. He updates it with some new figures from the past two or three years, but, at its core, it’s the same: The election was stolen. We’re a Third World country. Crime is up. Immigrants are going to attack your children — all sorts of fear factors.  And a lot of that act comes with huge, ugly racial overtones — especially in regard to the vice president. It makes you wonder: How long will it be before he really gets out of control? I think that’s going to happen at the debate. He’ll be in the ring with Harris, the vice president of the United States, a very sophisticated, very intelligent woman, and she will hammer him like a prosecutor. She won’t let him off the hook. In that moment, something may snap in him. And that’ll be it."
Trump flunks basic science yet again in speech insulting Harris' intelligence,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-north-carolina-speech-smart-rcna166779,"Donald Trump promised an “intellectual” speech during his campaign stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. True to form, Trump broke his vow. Instead, what rallygoers got were some mind-numbingly misinformed ramblings from a septuagenarian nominee. Over the last several weeks, Trump has lobbed all kinds of puerile insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, attempting to undermine her intelligence. During this very speech, which Trump claimed would focus on the economy, Trump claimed Harris is “not smart.” But it's hard to take such insults seriously when Trump himself fails to grasp some fairly basic concepts involving science and economics. For example, he went on a rant arguing that Harris wants to “abolish oil, coal and natural gas,” and he suggested people who use wind power can't use their electronics when it’s not windy. In reality, the vice president is currently serving in an administration that has overseen a record boom in domestic oil production. And wind turbines are capable of storing power, so people who rely on them do not need to experience some ""Wizard of Oz""-level wind storm to use their appliances and gadgets. But this is not the scenario Trump envisioned in his speech: Trump has long demonstrated his ignorance of and aversion to wind power and other climate-conscious policies. During another rant against wind power back in 2019, Trump admitted he “never understood wind.” Evidently, he still doesn’t. That this confusion comes from a man who’s called climate change a “hoax” and repeatedly claimed that the primary consequence of rising sea levels will be more beachfront property doesn’t inspire confidence in his capacity to confront the issues of climate change or encourage an expansion of renewable energy.  Trump also admitted on Wednesday that he doesn't know what “net zero” means, referring to “Kamala’s extreme high-cost energy policy known as net zero.” But then he took it further: In reality, many people — all over the world — are familiar with the term (but if you're not, “net zero” refers to the point at which the amount of greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount being removed from the atmosphere). In fact, there are even quick, eye-catching videos online that explain the concept in simple terms for people like Trump who don’t know what it means. So much for science. On the economics front, Trump demonstrated his grasp of the subject by holding up a large package of Tic Tac mints next to a smaller one and saying, “This is inflation.” He didn’t elaborate. He went on to talk about how inflation, which has actually been slowing as of late, is destroying our country. How the existence of different size packages of mints connects to inflation was left for the audience to guess at.  Trump is the leader of an entire political party, with staff and advisers who could help fill in the gaps in his knowledge, to educate him and his followers. But Trump seems perfectly content to wallow in ignorance — and to pull the MAGA faithful into the misinformed muck with him."
Harris — like Trump — wants to stop taxing tips. That’s a bad idea.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-economic-plan-leave-one-ill-advised-strategy-rcna166782,"In the three weeks (yes, it has only been that long) since she became a candidate for the White House, Kamala Harris’ campaign has proven remarkably skilled and successful. Which is why it was strange to see Harris make what might have been the first major mistake of her campaign: Adopting one of Donald Trump’s new policy positions, ending federal taxation of income from tips.  Like many tax proposals, ending taxation on tips has an intuitive appeal — until you consider its true implications. So the Harris campaign made a misstep in two ways: Appearing to parrot Trump, and doing so in the service of a bad idea.  The proposal has all the earmarks of something Trump heard somewhere, tested out before a crowd, and when it got a round of applause, decided it would become an official position of his candidacy. It’s unlikely he put more than a few moments of thought into it, let alone considered all the pros and cons. But there is a version of it in Congress, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. One of its biggest problems is that it doesn’t contain safeguards preventing the wealthy from shifting their income into something they’ll call “tips,” thereby enabling them to avoid paying taxes.  The Harris campaign says her proposal — which, like Trump’s, hasn’t yet been laid out in detail — “comes with an income limit and with strict requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of the policy.” It would apply only to service workers in industries such as retail and hotels. Which is why both candidates have promoted the idea in Nevada, a swing state where a large number of workers are employed in the hospitality industry.  Nevertheless, Trump’s promise didn’t exactly transform the race; the powerful Culinary Workers Union in Nevada, which along with its parent union UNITE HERE has endorsed Harris, wasn’t impressed by his proposal. “Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” one top official said.  As tax proposals go, this one is limited in its effects: An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows that of the approximately 4 million Americans who rely on tips, more than a third already make too little to owe any federal income taxes. But if Harris really wants to start a salutary discussion about tipping, she could propose eliminating the practice entirely, or at least scaling it back. We’ve all noticed how tipping has spread like wildfire; it seems like almost every purchase you make is now accompanied by a request for a tip, even when you received nothing resembling “service” at all. More importantly, tipping is a practice that has deeply racist roots; as an Economic Policy Institute report notes, “Following the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, formerly enslaved Black workers were often relegated to service jobs (e.g., food service workers and railroad porters). However, instead of paying Black workers any wage at all, employers suggested that guests offer Black workers a small tip for their services.”  Today, while the minimum wage hasn’t been raised from $7.25 an hour in 15 years, employers are allowed to pay tipped workers a minimum of just $2.13 — and that latter figure has remained the same for 33 years. The law says that if their tips don’t bring their total income up to $7.25, then employers are supposed to pay them the difference, but they don’t always do so, one of many forms wage theft takes. That’s just one kind of exploitation tipped workers are subjected to; millions of female servers have to grin and bear constant sexual harassment from customers, because their income is dependent on not angering the guy who just made an offensive remark or put his hands on their body. One survey found 70% of female servers saying they had experienced sexual harassment.  But if tipping is going to be with us at least for now, wouldn’t exempting tips from taxes still give a hand to low-wage workers? Perhaps some, but it would come with unintended consequences. For instance, lower income subjected to taxes today would mean lower benefits for those workers when they retire. As Berkeley economist Sylvia Allegretto notes, “Tips that are not taxed will not be credited towards the time and amount that workers are putting towards their Social Security.” So they would end up gaining very little if anything out of the deal. Lowering taxed income would also reduce the amount some workers would receive through the Earned Income Tax Credit.  There’s also a fundamental principle guiding proposals like this one that progressives should push against at every opportunity: that some kinds of income deserve to be treated better by the tax system than other kinds. Why should a person earning $25,000 a year in tips waiting tables at a diner not pay taxes, while a person earning the same $25,000 at a fast-food restaurant next door should? “As a general rule, you want to treat all income the same,” says Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “You don’t want to give people an incentive to game the tax code. This is one reason (in addition to giving a lot of money to rich people) that most on the left hate the carried interest deduction. We allow some of the richest people in the country to have much or most of their wage income to be taxed at the capital gains rate.” Just as we shouldn’t tax investment income at a lower rate than the income people get from working, it violates progressives’ belief in equality to say certain kinds of work should be exempt from taxes while other kinds shouldn’t.  Vice President Harris will be releasing her economic plan soon, and we should hope that it contains proposals that will make a difference to more Americans. Those could include increasing both the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage (or better yet, eliminating the distinction entirely), restoring the increased Child Tax Credit that was in place during the pandemic, and strengthening the ability of workers to form unions. All that would be much more meaningful than a proposal that amounts to little more than a gimmick. After all, if Trump thinks it’s a good idea, we should all be suspicious."
Michael Cohen's Supreme Court appeal is a long shot. These experts just explained why it's still important.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/michael-cohen-supreme-court-appeal-amicus-brief-rcna166721,"Michael Cohen asked the Supreme Court last month to take up his appeal against Donald Trump and others, seeking civil damages for alleged government retaliation during the former president's administration. Cohen picked up support this week from a group of constitutional scholars and former federal officials, who urged the justices to review the case.  The appeal from Trump’s former lawyer and fixer “raises questions that go to the heart of ordered liberty and the rule of law,” they wrote in their amicus brief. That’s true. But the challenge for Cohen is that the type of claim he’s pressing is one that the Supreme Court has all but abandoned. In a 1971 case called Bivens, the high court allowed a damages claim against federal officials for alleged Fourth Amendment violations. But the court has taken a stingy view since then, routinely rejecting so-called Bivens claims. In a 2022 decision, Justice Clarence Thomas’ majority opinion cited Bivens while noting: “Over the past 42 years, however, we have declined 11 times to imply a similar cause of action for other alleged constitutional violations.” Thomas wrote that the court will deny claims “in all but the most unusual circumstances.” Mindful of that high bar, the scholars and former officials do well to stress the extreme events underlying Cohen’s petition. “The extraordinary facts alleged here illustrate the essential necessity of deterrence to the rule of law,” they wrote:  “The stakes could not be higher,” they went on, arguing that ruling against Cohen “sends a clear signal to federal actors that critics of the government can be punished without repercussion for exercising their constitutional rights.” In addition to Trump, Cohen sought damages against former Attorney General Bill Barr and other Trump-era officials. Trump lawyer Alina Habba, who’s been sanctioned for frivolous Trump-related litigation, has called Cohen’s case frivolous. Habba’s response to Cohen’s petition is due Sept. 13, days before the GOP presidential nominee is set to be sentenced Sept. 18 in his New York criminal case (though his lawyers are attempting to delay that sentencing). After the response is filed, Cohen can file a reply brief. It takes four justices to grant review. So, will they take the case? The state of the law stacks the odds against Cohen — and that’s without accounting for whatever additional political considerations might factor into the court’s calculus. But the case highlights the dangers of officials retaliating against critics without a legal remedy to check that behavior. It’s an issue that goes beyond Trump and Cohen, but it’s especially difficult to ignore in the shadow of a potential revenge-packed second Trump term.

"Donald Trump seeks to delay New York sentencing, citing immunity ruling",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 9:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-ny-hush-money-sentencing-delay-rcna166750,"In their latest delay bid, Donald Trump’s lawyers want Judge Juan Merchan to push the former president's New York sentencing to some time after the presidential election. Among the reasons they cite in a letter dated Wednesday is the Supreme Court’s ruling that granted at least some presidential immunity in criminal cases. It seems unlikely that Merchan, who just rejected Trump’s latest request for the judge to recuse himself, will agree to another adjournment. The immunity ruling already led the judge to push Trump’s sentencing from July to Sept. 18. Merchan is set to rule on Sept. 16 on Trump’s motion to set aside his guilty verdicts (rendered in May, prior to the July 1 immunity decision) on the grounds that they run afoul of the Supreme Court’s new immunity rule. If Merchan rejects Trump’s motion, then that would clear the way for sentencing two days later. But if Merchan rules against Trump’s immunity claim, then the Republican presidential candidate’s lawyers have signaled that they want to appeal such an adverse decision before Trump is sentenced. “A single business day is an unreasonably short period of time for President Trump to seek to vindicate these rights, if he must,” they write. They argue that an adjournment is necessary “to allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling.” The letter notes that the immunity ruling, which arose in the federal election interference case, happened in a pre-trial posture and that the Supreme Court said that immunity issues are appealable pre-trial. “It follows that any denial of the pending motion is immediately appealable in a similar procedural posture,” Trump’s lawyers write. However, the New York case is different because Trump was already found guilty before the Supreme Court made its decision on immunity. So this case is in a post-trial posture, not pre-trial. Nonetheless, his lawyers argue in their letter that until the prosecution’s “immunity violations are addressed fully and finally, this Court may not ‘adjudicate’ the matter — including at sentencing.” Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove also write that an adjournment is necessary to prevent prosecutors from filing their sentencing position to the court while the immunity issue is pending. They argue that prosecutors “should not be permitted to file a public sentencing submission that will include what the Supreme Court described as the ‘threat of punishment,’ in a manner that is personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the Presidency as a result of the type of ‘peculiar public opprobrium’ associated with these proceedings that troubled the Trump Court.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

We’ll talk about continued fallout of that immunity decision. Now we’ve got Jeffrey Clark asking for a dismissal of his bar disciplinary proceedings in D.C. as a result of that decision. And of course, we’ve got action on Capitol Hill with the introduction of the No Kings Act, really to respond directly to the immunity decision. And then finally, we will talk about some news that broke yesterday, an agreement to cooperate by Jenna Ellis with the state A.G. in Arizona in the case they are brought against fraudulent electors and those who supported them and facilitated that scheme. And we are really going to try to do a list of questions. Andrew Weissmann: And, yes. Mary McCord: That’s our goal. Andrew Weissmann: We are getting to them. Mary McCord: We’re going to do it. Andrew Weissmann: You know, we were actually going over them before the show. And they’re really, really terrific. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So we’re going to get through that agenda and then get to the listener questions. So let’s talk about, again, it’s more fallout from the Supreme Court immunity decision. But this is sort of direct fallout because the case is now back with Judge Chutkan. This is normal procedure where the baton goes back from when cases on appeal, it goes back to the district court. And here, Judge Chutkan really wasted no time. And there’s sort of two main things that she did. The first is scheduling. She issued an immediate scheduling order. And the first thing she did is she said she wants to hear from the parties jointly, if possible, in a submission where she said, please state any agreements. You can always put disagreements by this Friday as to what you think the way forward is. What do you think the next steps are? Should there be a hearing? Should there be briefing? What do you think the timing should be? So the parties are going to put something in by this Friday. Spoiler alert. Mary McCord: Do you think there’ll be any disagreements? What do you think? Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Spoiler alerts. Mary McCord: I think they’re going to agree on everything. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So spoiler alert. Donald Trump will be no long briefing -- Mary McCord: No. No. No. Andrew Weissmann: -- no hearing. Mary McCord: Stay everything until after the election. I bet that’s what he’ll say. Andrew Weissmann: This was from the man who said, you know, please set the trial for the year, you know, 20 -- Mary McCord: 2026. Andrew Weissmann: Maybe I should say 2040. Mary McCord: Yeah, that would be more likely. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So there’s that scheduling where she said, I want to hear from the parties this Friday. That is a filing that we all should be able to see. It should be filed on the docket. And then she said she wants to see the parties. The defendant does not have to be there, meaning Donald Trump does not have to be there for a scheduling conference to decide what should happen. And that is going to happen next Friday. So the two dates are August 9th and August 16th. So we’ll have some updates and presumably a decision on the 16th from Judge Chutkan as to how she wants to proceed, having heard from the parties. So that’s sort of step one. And step two is something we’re going to spend more time talking about. And I’ll turn it over to you in a second. Just the preview is that there was a pending motion that, actually a lot of pending motions, but there was a pending motion that Donald Trump had made that was for dismissal of the case for selective prosecution and vindictive prosecution. They’re slightly different, different legal standards, but they’re similar in kind and generally one sort of goes with the other. And as you recall, during the stay period from December until last Friday, Judge Chutkan could not rule on anything. Mary McCord: But she was clearly working. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah, she may have had it already, but on Friday she got the green light and she issued her 16-page decision denying Donald Trump’s selective and vindictive prosecution motion. So those are the big highlights of where we are. But obviously the big issue is going to be about the immunity case and what its import is in terms of the case going forward. Mary McCord: Yeah, absolutely. And I do want to bring people back because, you know, this case was stayed for a long time, right? Well, actually, before the Supreme Court even took it, it was stayed during the D.C. Circuit appeal. And so it’s been stayed for a very long time. Obviously, she was taking motions that had already been briefed and obviously had her a written and ready to go as soon as she got the case back, which is the opinion you’re talking about. But just for listeners to remember, there were a whole slew of motions to dismiss. And I went through all of them yesterday to make sure there’s now nothing outstanding. And the motion to dismiss on immunity grounds is obviously the one that generated the ultimate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. She had also denied at that same time when she denied the immunity motion or the motion to dismiss based on immunity. She had also denied a motion to dismiss based on constitutional grounds that Trump’s prosecution violated the First Amendment, violated the double jeopardy clause, violated due process. That was denied also and that is now done. She also on Friday in that same short order where she set a schedule for the parties to propose the pre-trial proceedings going forward and also set a hearing, the same ones you just talked about, Andrew. In that short order, she also denied the motion to dismiss the indictment based on statutory grounds. And she denied that without prejudice for the defendant, Mr. Trump, to refile a renewed motion once all of the issues of immunity have been resolved. And what that meant, that motion on statutory grounds, which was the only other motion to dismiss that was still pending besides selective and vindictive prosecution, which she has now denied. That was the only other one that had remained pending and that was basically Donald Trump saying these allegations against me and the indictment are not covered by the statutes that the prosecution is relying upon to charge me. They’re just not within what these statutes covered and so this should all be dismissed. Now, I think it’s interesting, and you’ll see again, this is about immunity fallout. She’s saying I’m denying that right now, but you can renew it after we make decisions about what are official acts for which you can’t be prosecuted or official acts for which the government has or hasn’t rebutted a presumption of immunity from prosecution, what are unofficial acts for which you can be prosecuted, and are those still things that would be covered by the statutes. The conspiracy under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 371, the obstruction and conspiracy to obstruct official proceedings and ultimately the conspiracy to violate civil rights. So that’s why that is open to being re-brought after all the decisions about immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And there is also the Fischer case that we talked about. Essentially, the judge is saying, let me see what remains and after everyone’s been heard and we have a hearing and there’s no reason to decide something in the abstract. Mary McCord: The Fischer case being the Supreme Court case about obstruction of an official proceeding, which, as we’ve talked about before, we think will apply very differently when we’re talking about Mr. Trump -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- because it applies to things that are well beyond any violent assault on the Capitol and include the fraudulent elector scheme, for example. Andrew Weissmann: So I wanted to take just a couple of minutes just to explain what selective and vindictive prosecution means just in the big picture, not getting too in the weeds just because it’s the kind of thing, Mary, you and I know so well from litigating these matters. So selective prosecution, it is required for the defendant to show that somebody similarly situated to the defendant was not prosecuted. That’s sort of step one. And again, there’s lots of nuance to that. But the second part is that the decision to prosecute this person was done with a discriminatory reason, so like based on race or assertion of constitutional right, something like that. It is a very, very hard standard to meet. And then let me just talk about vindictive prosecution, because it’s a very related concept. Vindictive prosecution is when the government is alleged and then shown to have taken action against a defendant because of their assertion of a right. So where it comes up at times is somebody is charged with crimes A and B and the defendant makes motions, appeals and maybe win something, maybe doesn’t win. And then after the appeal, there’s more charges brought, and the defendant can say, wait a second, you’re retaliating for just my litigating. Mary McCord: Well, try having a due process right to do. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Constitutional right. Andrew Weissmann: And as you can imagine, the courts say the government can’t do that. But there are many legitimate reasons why you might bring those new charges, because you might have continued the investigation, for instance, and found new evidence. So again, it’s a hard thing to show. And I had just two quick thoughts on that one sort of in the weeds with respect to this judge and one about Judge Cannon. So Judge Chutkan said there just is no showing, no evidence whatsoever with respect to either of those claims that Donald Trump is not similarly situated to anyone who has not been prosecuted, leaving aside that there was no showing of discriminatory purpose or animus whatsoever and goes through the timeline here. And in many ways, when you look for a similarly situated person, you can look for all sorts of factors, including leadership position. So clearly thinking of all of the hundreds of January 6 people who attacked the Capitol and the charges here, which she has to accept as true for the purposes of the motion of his role sort of at the top of that conspiracy. So it’s quite devastating. And she also takes to task the effort by Donald Trump to reframe the indictment as simply charging him for bringing legal actions questioning the validity of the 2020 election. She said that’s not at all what’s charged. In fact, it’s explicitly stated that is not what is being charged. It is joining a criminal conspiracy to do that. Mary McCord: I think in many ways, that’s what’s the most remarkable about her opinion, because honestly, the claims of selective and vindictive prosecution were such a stretch by Mr. Trump and his team. And on the vindictive side, essentially, they were relying on one or two statements made by President Biden about seeking accountability and that kind of thing and hoping there would be accountability for Mr. Trump that, you know, is really what was driving their claim and that’s just not anywhere close to proving even the predicate to get discovery or further hearings, because they wanted a hearing as well on this claim of vindictive prosecution. But she starts right on page two, saying at the outset, court must address, as it has before, defendants improper reframing of the allegations against him. And she says he declares that the indictment amounts only to a government theory that it is illegal to dispute the outcome of an election and work with others to propose alternate electors. And then she says that description mischaracterizes his alleged conduct. Defendant is charged with knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings. And then she quotes from the indictment what you were referring to, Andrew -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- which is actually when the indictment itself says defendant had a right, like every American, to speak publicly about the election and even to claim falsely that there had been outcome determinative fraud during the election and that he had won. He was also entitled to formally challenge the results of the election through lawful and appropriate means. So she’s really just drawing that line right at the beginning. I’m not going to buy into your false narrative about this. I have to correct it because that’s not what’s charged. Andrew Weissmann: Right. And one thing to note is she’s very careful. She’s not saying that’s what happened. She is not making a fact finding. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: She is taking the allegations in the indictment and saying your characterization, Donald Trump team, of what is charged is incorrect. But that’s very separate than her saying, and now I’ve had a hearing and I’m making a factual finding. I think that’s a good segue to the fact that this same motion was made before Judge Cannon. Judge Cannon ruled on a very similar motion made by Walt Nauta, a co-defendant in that Florida case, and said, as was obvious, that there is no selective or vindictive prosecution. But notably, Judge Cannon did not rule on Donald Trump’s -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- motion, and she easily could have, but she didn’t, I think, want to give the public that sort of like that win to the government and have this public document saying, no, Donald Trump has not been selectively or vindictively prosecuted, which, by the way, is really clear. But it’s just notable to me that Judge Cannon took the time to decide that motion with respect to -- Mary McCord: For the co-defendant. Andrew Weissmann: -- a co-defendant. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: But not decide it for Donald Trump. And yet, as we’ve talked about, is the outlier judge, one out of nine who issues your decision on the first day of the RNC convention saying the case is dismissed. I mean, the confluence of facts is so bad for the rule of law. And it’s so bad for judges who’ve been appointed by Donald Trump, who are really good judges who are now tarred by that kind of conduct on her part. But anyway, you can tell that Judge Cannon -- Mary McCord: We’re getting triggered. We’re getting triggered. Andrew Weissmann: Trigger Avenue. Mary McCord: Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Mary McCord: So, this is a good time, I think, for us to take a break. And when we come back, we will get back into some of the continued fallout from that immunity decision. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I actually find there’s like a really interesting tie between the selective prosecution arguments and claims that we just talked about and what we’re about to talk about involving Jeffrey Clark. It’s fascinating. I have a theory that I’m going to float and I want to hear, Mary, like what you think and why it’s wrong. Mary McCord: All right. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Mary McCord: Cliffhanger. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. Before we get to Andrew leaving us hanging on a cliff to fall off, I got like one finger. I’m going to just frame up where we’re at with this Jeffrey Clark stuff. So Jeffrey Clark, of course, was at the Department of Justice. He was the person who Mr. Trump wanted to make and arguably did make his acting attorney general for a matter of hours right before January 6th, somebody that had been very willing to buy into Mr. Trump’s claims of election fraud and to pressure states to look into this. And in fact, Jeffrey Clark was at the Department of Justice proposing to send letters to state legislative officials and secretaries of state, particularly, for example, in Georgia, saying you should really be looking into this election fraud. We think there’s a basis for that, et cetera. This, though, is something people will recall from our extended discussion of the immunity decision, that the one thing that the Supreme Court decided that can’t really be re-reviewed down in the lower court, well, can’t be reviewed in lower court, is that with respect to Mr. Trump’s communications with his own Department of Justice officials, that’s within the scope of his official acts, and he is absolutely immune for prosecution based on any sort of pressure on DOJ to actually pressure others to investigate bogus claims of election fraud. So, Mr. Clark, meanwhile, in addition to having been charged in Georgia, he also has faced disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia, where he has his bar license, right. And these are proceedings, and we’ve talked before about lawyers have to pass a bar in any state in which they practice and they are subject to disciplinary proceedings for violating the codes of professional responsibility and committing other ethical violations and certainly for committing crimes. There has been ongoing for some time now these disciplinary proceedings in D.C. before the Board on Professional Responsibility of the D.C. Bar. There was actually an evidentiary hearing or trial where people like other former DOJ officials, Richard Donohue, et cetera, testified. And the recommendation of the board was that Mr. Clark be suspended from the practice of law for two years. Now, he has a right to take that on appeal to the D.C. Court of Appeals, and he will do that and has done that. But in the meantime, before that appeal is fully briefed, he, like so many others, is trying to take advantage of that immunity decision and has filed a motion, not a motion. He’s filed a supplemental brief before the board saying these whole proceedings against me should be thrown out. This court has no jurisdiction. And as the immunity decision makes clear, I can’t be disciplined based on my conversations with the president that are within the president’s official acts. And so this entire disciplinary proceeding should go away. He makes other arguments, too, based on another Supreme Court case that we haven’t even talked about on this podcast called Jarkesy, which has to do with in certain SEC civil enforcement proceedings, a defendant is titled to a jury trial as opposed to just a hearing before judges. So he makes an argument that he should have a jury trial as well. But we’re going to set that aside for now because that would take up way too much of this episode. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: And the main thrust of this is, hey, me too, me too, me too. If Trump’s immune, I’m immune. And as we’ve said before, presidential immunity does not mean immunity for everyone else. But nevertheless, here he is making that argument. Okay, now got one little pinky holding on to the edge of the cliff, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So let me just read some of what Jeffrey Clark says about the immunity decision because he quotes from this. And I think it’s useful because it really goes to the pernicious nature of the immunity decision. And it deals with the part of the decision that you said, Mary, where the court said that President Trump, when he’s dealing with his attorney general, those are core functions of the executive and that even if it’s related to conversations with the attorney general about sham investigations, which was the allegation and the indictment. So he cites this. He says, I’m quoting now, “the allegations against President Trump relating to his discussions with DOJ officials about whether to send the draft letter to Georgia officials and whether to replace the acting attorney general with Mr. Clark.” And now he quotes from the decision, the immunity decision, “plainly implicate Trump’s conclusive and preclusive authority,” unquote, because the executive branch has, and again, a quote, “exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecuting.” And here’s the key part. This is, again, in quotes, “including with respect to allegations of election crime.” And the Supreme Court also said that the president may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions. And here’s, again, the money quote, “with his attorney general and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty.” So you see the problem, which is that although the court was deciding what the president can do when he’s dealing with underlings in the Department of Justice carrying out his orders, or at least arguably carrying them out, what is the level of immunity? Is it within the core functions? And also, how would you go about even using that evidence and proving it in court? Would you have to use official act evidence, which the court also said you can’t use? So Jeffrey Clark is saying that decision really protects him because he was just carrying out the president’s bidding here in terms of what he was doing. Mary McCord: And I would say and I know you want to tie it, but I would say that also he’s essentially -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- and I think this is one of the problems with the capacious language that the Supreme Court used in that opinion is because their rationale for not only immunity, but also the bar on using official acts evidence to prove unofficial acts is essentially that it would interfere with the independence of the executive branch and the carrying out of the president’s core constitutional authority. So that opens the door for underlings, not the president, to say the damage, the harm would be just the same. Andrew Weissmann: The same. Mary McCord: So I should get the benefit of the same immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Right. And you would have to open the door to the kind of evidence that you don’t want to include. And just to make it clear, the allegation here is that Jeffrey Clark’s, the letter that was being sent was false. Mary McCord: False. Andrew Weissmann: That’s the allegation is that they wanted to just like the Ukraine first impeachment, Donald Trump wanted the specter of an investigation. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: He wanted the specter of an investigation about Georgia. He wanted the specter of an investigation about Joe Biden from the Ukraine authorities, even though there was no basis for it, as I think as the president said, like, just make the claim. I’ll take it from there. Mary McCord: Right. And this is where the testimony of people like Richard Donohue, who was the acting deputy attorney general, Jeff Rosen, the acting attorney general at the time, you know, they’re saying we don’t have any evidence of election fraud significant enough to change the outcome. So it is false to put in a letter to state officials that we do. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And I know most listeners are going, how can that possibly be part of the core function? But just to be clear, that is in the immunity decision. And so the quotes that Jeffrey Clark, you can’t fault him for taking the Supreme Court decision and saying, I want to apply it here. To me, the way I think this relates to what we were just talking about with respect to Judge Chutkan is something that I was really concerned about when I read the immunity decision, which is how is this not overruling the entire body of law about selective prosecution? Selective prosecution law is the court overseeing the Department of Justice with respect to how it is instituting and bringing cases. We just talked about -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- are they similarly situated people and are you acting improperly and in a discriminatory way? How is that whole body of law, which, by the way, just to be clear, the Supreme Court did not in its decision say it’s overruling. But how is it going to square the two? And one way to square it is to say, well, no, in this circumstance where you’re violating these sort of this separate constitutional provision. But if that’s the case, then the fact that you’re instituting a sham investigation of somebody, how is that not a violation of due process? But they said that it isn’t. So there’s a huge tension that I think the Jeff Clark motion gets at in terms of selective prosecution and how it’s going to survive, because even this Supreme Court, I don’t think is going to say we’re just getting rid of selective prosecution as a theory. I mean, their whole idea is that they are trying to denigrate the Department of Justice when they don’t like a prosecution. So it’s hard to see, though, theoretically how they’re going to deal with that problem. But I do think Jeffrey Clark, as much as I deplore what, assuming it’s proved and obviously the board found that he did do this and was reckless in the way he did it, but assuming that’s valid, you know what he did is so incredibly deplorable. But as a legal matter, he is right to raise this issue and it does point to a real tension and flaw in the Supreme Court decision. So anyway, Mary, that was my big picture. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: By the way, one of the reasons I’m going on and on and on about this is I’m waiting for you to tell me. No, no, no, relax, don’t worry. Mary McCord: Well, it’s an interesting concept. And I want to make sure I’m following you because you’re saying it’ll do away with selective prosecution as sort of a theory that a defendant could bring an argument there being selectively prosecuted. I’m actually thinking, doesn’t it just then essentially almost give a bunch of potential defendants the ability to say now this is selective because this other person, the president of the United States, is not going to be able to be prosecuted for these things that I’m going to be prosecuted for. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I think that would be harder because they’re not really similar situated, right. Mary McCord: Yeah, I agree. Andrew Weissmann: But I mean, it certainly is an unfairness. Mary McCord: There is an unfairness, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But sometimes that unfairness, as a friend of mine used to say, one of my mentors, life’s full of tough choices, you know, like there are lots of things that are unfair. But anyway, I really do think for our listeners, I know that the Jeffrey Clark thing is not a criminal case. I know that it’s coming up in the connection with a bar proceeding. But it’ll be really interesting to see because this is the kind of thing that Jeffrey Clark will get to take to a court to review how they’re going to deal with this issue. And obviously, Mark Meadows and other people who have been criminally charged will be making the same kind of arguments. Mary McCord: Yeah. I do think that, and they are, you know, they already are. We talked about Mark Meadows last week -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- and it’s going to keep coming. The floodgates keep opening or opening wider, I suppose. But at any rate, last point I was going to make on this is that it can’t be that that decision about presidential immunity is going to then immunize the entire executive branch of the United States for bad and illegal behavior or else we are really, really in trouble. Andrew Weissmann: In trouble. In trouble is the Mary McCord polite term. Mary McCord: Yeah. I’ve tried to not use, you know, foul language on our PG rated. Andrew Weissmann: In deep doo-doo. Mary McCord: Yes, exactly. The rule of law is dead, if that’s the case. So we can come back to that some other day. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So, Mary, should we break? We have a few things we wanted to just quickly cover, but then get to our listener questions. Mary McCord: Yes, we should. But after I say one more thing, which is that there is another type of fallout from this, which we teased at the top and which we will talk about a lot more on our episode with Steve Vladeck, our premium episode, which is one of the responses is this bill, the No Kings Act that’s been now introduced in Congress, that would essentially deprive the U.S. Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction to enforce immunity for a president for violating the criminal law and also deprive the court of reviewing the constitutionality of the No Kings Act, a very interesting comment. Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: Well said. So we’ll definitely get it. That is total preview for Monday. Should we take our break? Mary McCord: Okay. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. Before we turn to listener questions, and I have to keep this very brief because Andrew is definitely going to make sure we get to listener questions. Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: So Jenna Ellis, as folks know, was one of the attorneys that the Trump campaign used post-election in 2020 to file all kinds of frivolous lawsuits challenging the election results in various states. She’s actually been disciplined in some of those states, but she was also very involved in other efforts, including, you know, fraudulent electors scheme and other just general schemes to try to push the legislators in different states, Georgia, Arizona, elsewhere, to send up fraudulent slates of electors, et cetera. She has been charged, of course, and pleaded guilty in Georgia in return for her cooperation. Pleaded guilty to, I think, just a misdemeanor. And now we’ve heard that in Arizona, where she was also charged, that she has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Arizona attorney general, by which she’s not even having to plead guilty to anything at all. She’s getting all the charges, and I think there were nine charges against her dismissed in return for her cooperation there. Now, there are a number of defendants charged in Arizona, not as many, I guess, as in Georgia, but not Mr. Trump. This is a case where lots of others got brought into it, but not Mr. Trump. People like Giuliani, Boris Epstein, et cetera. So, that we will see what comes of that, if and when that prosecution actually starts getting to a stage of trial proceedings and how and in what ways she might be offering testimony there. But I will say, and we can talk about this longer on another day, that I think for Andrew and me, as longtime career prosecutors, we’ve been a little bit surprised at how favorably -- Andrew Weissmann: Lenient. Mary McCord: -- lenient, yes. Yes. The favorable deals that some of the state prosecutors have made with defendants in the cases against him, very favorable in Georgia and actually, you know, was even called not a crime of moral turpitude so that it wouldn’t affect her bar there. I mean, all kinds of things. And then not even having to plead guilty to anything in Arizona. So she better produce. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, when you decide what to offer somebody, there are all sorts of factors. How serious are the charges? What is the quality of the information the person is giving? At what stage are they cooperating? Is it really early on where you need to get a toehold and the information is really valuable? Have they pled guilty somewhere else and they’re going to be held accountable elsewhere? All of those go into the complicated decision about whether to charge somebody, what to require them to plead to if they want to cooperate. Obviously, the person doesn’t have to plead to anything. They can go to trial, but in terms of what you as a government prosecutor want to offer. And, you know, it’s very fact specific. But in this situation where especially the Georgia case, all of these are under this sort of first time offender rules in Georgia, where if you’re sort of good for the next year, essentially, it goes away. It’s like it’s not even on your record. And as you said, the judges recommended that it’s not a crime of moral turpitude so that you’re not sort of disbarred and lose your law license. So you do look to see whether the person is really, really cooperating in exchange for what it seems like a very lenient deal. With that, is it time? Mary McCord: It’s time. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Maybe I’ll read the first one and then paraphrase it and then turn it to you. We can go back and forth. So the first question we got is really interesting and it’s one that we’ve gotten from various people. And the question is, is impeachment null and void since impeachment is a mechanism provided within the Constitution to address accountability for high crimes and misdemeanors? Does the Supreme Court’s broad immunity decision for the president basically eliminate the possibility of any accountability through impeachment proceedings? That’s the question. Mary, what do you think? Mary McCord: No. Andrew Weissmann: Wow. Yeah. Okay. This is great because usually with lawyers, my answers are usually, well, it depends. Mary McCord: Yeah. But this is one where I do think it is pretty conclusively a no. And it would have been nice for the Supreme Court to say sort of more on this, but I actually think that their entire decision in many ways about immunity from criminal prosecution is based on a notion that there is a political remedy, which is impeachment. And the problem with that is that in today’s world, that remedy is just basically not available because of the partisanship now on Capitol Hill. I mean, if Congress, you know, was unable to actually have a successful impeachment conviction after January 6th, it’s hard to imagine when they would be able to agree. And remember, with respect to the impeachment trial after January 6th, the House had voted to impeach. Those articles impeachment were sent to the Senate where a trial was held. A majority of senators, including a number of Republicans, did vote to convict, but it has to be a two-thirds vote. So I think, you know, from just a not a legal argument, but just sort of placing the immunity decision in the context of how is accountability supposed to be handled in our constitutional scheme, the other main way is through impeachment and there’s nothing about the court’s decision that says that’s not available. And then the second thing I’d say with respect to that is that high crimes and misdemeanors in the impeachment clause, that existed before we even had a federal criminal code, before we even had state criminal codes. And so the high crimes and misdemeanors has really kind of always been what Congress determines it to be. They don’t really have to be things that, you know, they can point to a particular criminal code violation. They often do. But it’s the body of doctrine and law, you know, sort of on its own. So, I don’t see this as changing that from a legal perspective, but from a reality, it’s just very difficult these days. Andrew Weissmann: So I agree. Two quick thoughts. One, remember Mitch McConnell when he during the impeachment said, look, I’m not going to vote to convict, but you should remember there is both civil and criminal accountability for what happened. Well, not so much. Mary McCord: And a number of them then followed course -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- and said, the reason we’re not voting to convict is he can stand trial criminally, you know, if that is something that is warranted. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, not according to the Supreme Court. So the other is, remember, this is an immunity decision. It’s not saying it’s not a crime. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s saying the president’s criminally immune. So it doesn’t say he’s immune from impeachment, and it still is a crime. It’s just a question of immunity. So they didn’t say that, in fact, it’s not a crime. Okay. Mary McCord: All right. Question two. Because of Trump’s 34 felonies, of course, coming from the Manhattan case, will he be prevented from voting in the November election? Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So this is a matter of state law. So Donald Trump is a resident of Florida and so he would vote in Florida. And so each state can have different rules with respect to what happens if you are convicted of a crime and also what stage of the conviction and what the consequences are. There’s a whole movement right now essentially to eradicate sort of felony disenfranchisement. So just because you’ve been convicted of a felony that you shouldn’t be forever barred from voting. And so under Florida law, it’s kind of complicated. But my understanding is under Florida law, he would be able to vote for himself in the November election. You know, the big picture is we’re a country where apparently one major party thinks it’s fine to put on the ballot somebody who’s been convicted of 34 felony counts. And we may see in the middle of September, September 18th, Judge Merchan in the Manhattan case may very well, depending on what he decides on some pending motions, may very well be sentencing Donald Trump in September. So he will really be convicted at that point and sentenced. He may not get jail time. He may get jail time, but not be required to start serving it. But he should be allowed under Florida law to still vote for himself. Mary McCord: And I believe, isn’t it New York law that says you can vote even if you’ve been convicted unless you’re actually serving a sentence. So I suppose theoretically, if you were in, you know, prison on November 5th, that would be a barrier, but I think that’s unlikely. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, there’s a related question, which is about postponing sentencing from a listener in Minnesota, very much in the news this morning, writing to ask why Justice Marchand postponed sentencing until after Trump’s immunity status in the case was ascertained. The trial is over. His guilt is a matter of record. Why is the Supreme Court decision retroactive? I have something to say on this, but I’m going to turn to you, Mary. Mary McCord: Okay. That’s a great question. Andrew Weissmann: Great. Mary McCord: And, yeah, it is. And this comes up in lots of other areas, too, when the law changes, you know, right after somebody is found guilty. And basically, the way the law works is that until it is final, so a case is not final until you’ve exhausted all of your appeals or all the time has run to take appeals and you haven’t taken appeals. And until then, if the law changes, you can take advantage of that change in the law and make an argument on appeal or in front, in this case, in front of the trial court judge because you’re not even yet up on appeal, that you should have a different result based on that change in the law. And so that’s the posture that we find ourselves in with respect to the Manhattan case, you know, after the guilty verdicts, but before sentencing. And you can’t even have an appeal until after sentencing. We have this change in the law with respect to immunity. And that is why Judge Merchan, you know, agreed to kind of hold up and allow briefing on this issue of whether and if so, how the immunity decision should impact the verdicts here. This is to be distinct from, for example, people whose convictions have long been final and there’s a new change in the law 20 years later and they come in and say, oh, I should get a new trial based on this change in the law. In those situations, it is extraordinarily rare that decisions of the Supreme Court are retroactive. It occasionally is the case and that’s the subject for a deep dive into, you know, law school level 200. Andrew Weissmann: That’s not even 2.0. That’s like 3.0. Mary McCord: That’s right. But that’s exceedingly rare. But we’re not in that situation here. Andrew Weissmann: So I think there is an argument with respect to the issue before Judge Merchan, where remember, the issue is the preclusion of official act evidence in a case that is unofficial because the rationale was, in part at least, that you don’t want to deter the sort of vigorous discussion and actions of the president. But the Hope Hicks testimony that we talked about, for instance, that’s already happened. There’s already been that conversation. And so the issue of applying that backwards to this trial, there’s no harm. In other words, it’s a new rule. I agree completely with your analysis of the way retroactivity law works. It’s just that there’s no reason to say it should apply here because it’s really a question of going forward -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- because this has all happened in the past. So you don’t have to worry about you want to deter this going forward. Mary McCord: Right. We can’t deter. You know, you can’t put the milk back in the bottle to the extent that any future president or anyone else would be deterred. That already happened. Andrew Weissmann: Right. So I didn’t see that in the D.A.’s brief, but I do think it’s a valid argument with respect to the long Hope Hicks discussion we had the other day on that. Okay, so, Mary, we’re going to get to more listener questions in future episodes because we just got so many really good ones. But we do have one last question. Mary McCord: Yes. Okay. This is from someone in Dallas who says, I am an 84-year-old granny in Dallas, went into the Peace Corps when JFK was president. Clean for Gene. You get the idea. Andrew Weissmann: Clean for Gene? I am old enough. You know what that’s a reference to? Gene McCarthy, 1968 presidential campaign. Mary McCord: Our listener says every time I listen to your podcast, I’m sorry that class is over too soon. Only in the past few weeks, I have relearned that persons appointed to the Supreme Court do not have to be attorneys. They do not even have to be college graduates. Here’s my question. Do you think that we could do just as well if the Supreme Court was made up entirely of nine childless cat ladies? Andrew, yes or no? Andrew Weissmann: Is this when I get to say it depends? Mary McCord: Yes, exactly. I think this is where we can say it depends. I don’t have the legal answer to that. Andrew Weissmann: So that is a great question and thank you. Shout out to the 84-year-old granny in Dallas. Wonderful childless cat lady question. So great note to end on, because there’s so much news and a lot of what we were talking about today doesn’t speak well for the Supreme Court decision and all of its ramifications. Tons to keep an eye out for. Obviously, everyone’s very focused on the politics right now, but there’s a lot going on in the legal front that Mary and I are happy to be able to chat with each other and all of you.

This Trump campaign post revives a racist American tradition,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 3:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-war-room-tweet-racist-rcna166639,"In an effort to boost its election hopes, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is drawing on the U.S.’s disturbing history of explicitly racist and xenophobic imagery.  On Tuesday, the ""Trump War Room"" account on X, which is run by the campaign, shared an unabashedly racist image that suggested if Kamala Harris is elected president, American neighborhoods will be overrun with hordes of Black people and immigrants.  “Import the third world/become the third world,” the post read, contrasting an image of a serene suburban neighborhood (in which no people are visible) with a photo depicting a huddled mass of mostly Black men crowded together on a city sidewalk. The essence of this post — that Black people, perhaps Black immigrants in particular, ought to be feared and rejected — is so grotesque and old-timey in its racism that it harks back to an era when such imagery was commonplace in mainstream American politics: the Jim Crow era.  In fact, whether it’s this post, the signs at Trump rallies (and the national convention!) calling for “Mass Deportation Now” or cartoons shared by Trump and his followers that depict Black people with darkened skin and nonhuman features, the Trump campaign is reviving the ugly American tradition of deploying unmistakably racist and xenophobic imagery as part of its political vocabulary — the type of stuff one might expect to see in the Ku Klux Klan’s Fiery Cross newspaper more than a half-century ago.  Here, for example, is a cartoon published in the Fiery Cross that depicted immigrants as “trash” and “undesirables.” That’s not so dissimilar to the message sent by the Trump campaign’s “third world” post or Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants’ being “vermin.” And here’s another cartoon published in that same newspaper, depicting Uncle Sam slamming the door shut on immigrants. “Whose country is this anyway?” the caption reads. The KKK's motto at the time it was sharing these images was literally ""America First,"" a phrase Trump and his followers have adopted as their own and used throughout his political career. Another ad from the pro-segregation Mothers’ League of Central High School in the 1950s called on voters to reject the historic push to desegregate the school in Little Rock, Arkansas, and support segregationists. “If the integrationists win this school board fight, the schools will be integrated this fall. There will be absolutely nothing you or we can do to stop it,” the flier warns. “DO YOU WANT NEGROES IN OUR SCHOOLS?”  The Trump War Room post on Tuesday is stoking those same bigoted fears about changing neighborhoods, fears that have never truly gone away, with imagery and rhetoric that are just as blatant as they were a hundred years ago."
Democrats need to rethink their strategies about young voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/young-voters-are-not-nearly-radical-made-rcna165771,"It appears the remaining old guy in the 2024 presidential race is trying hard not to make age his most obvious problem. Former President Donald Trump, who once led the charge to ban TikTok, in early June joined the platform where nearly a third of people under 30 are most likely to get their news. Since joining, he’s amassed 10 million followers with videos such as a mock face-off with boxer and provocateur Jake Paul and a decontextualized mashup of Vice President Kamala Harris calling 18- to 24-year-olds “stupid” (from a 2014 talk advocating for the rehabilitation of  juvenile offenders).  Trump is understandably trying to court young people to the political party that has long struggled to win their favor. Few lawmakers  — and zero House Republicans, according to July reporting by NPR — are on TikTok. That’s more on brand for younger, progressive politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and before that, Barack Obama, whose technological savvy and informal communication style aligned with their democratic, forward-thinking politics. Trump’s online vibe reads more anti-institutional than egalitarian, but his appeals to younger Americans, especially males, are not in vain: Data, and anecdotal observations, show that young voters’ consistent support for Democrats is becoming less assured. Gallup calculates that 18- to 29-year-olds prefer Democrats by a slimmer margin than we’ve seen since 2005. If this pattern holds, it will be the first election year since 2000 that the party hasn’t enjoyed a double-digit advantage among this cohort. The same survey projects that the Democratic Party would be at a deficit among the next youngest group, 30-49 years old, for the first presidential election year since 2004. Other pollsters caveat the difficulty of capturing youth voting preferences, but have noted a significant decline in support for the Democratic ticket and a boost for Trump. Last month, The New York Times warned of “the GOP convention looking awfully young” while The Free Press reported on “Zoomers turning MAGA.” Democrats, on the other hand, have been smashing fundraising records on Zoom meetings organized around so-called identitarian groupings. But they should be wary about overdetermining such categories, including around age. Stanford University’s recent program “America in One Room,” which gathered more than 400 prospective first-time voters to discuss their varying political views face to face, rather than via the more commonly available — and more anonymous — online forums, suggests that young people hold a wide range of political beliefs. And that they are eager to connect with each other across their differences in service of a better, shared future. In short: Democrats are going to have to work harder than usual to capture the support of young people they can usually count on — or at least count on not to vote Republican. As a professor and parent who interacts with young people daily, and as a historian of American political culture, I’m skeptical that a MAGA surge is afoot among our youngest voting citizens, who are deeply concerned with issues like climate change and social inequality, planks of the Democratic platform. But if conjuring a future of revanchist frat bros and aspiring ""tradwives"" is an unlikely political vision, so too is its funhouse mirror image that, to our peril, often dominates popular depictions of young progressives: dogmatic left-wing radicals who glorify violence, fixate on identity and view America as irredeemable. Rather than take this characterization for granted, Democrats should focus on offering young people an optimistic, forward-looking vision of how their administration can make good on America’s unfulfilled promise for a more equally shared prosperity. Trust me, I know firsthand this segment of the left exists among young potential voters, especially since campus protests took place following Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s ongoing military attacks in Gaza. And even as a vocal contingent of students occupied buildings, dominated meeting agendas and drained university resources, it became clear that a significant number of students felt aggressed, or even just extremely annoyed by such antics, yet were uncomfortable speaking out. Contrary to popular impressions, all college students do not embrace this brand of political progressivism, and there is no reason to believe most young people subscribe to the beliefs we’ve seen covered in the media.  To remain on my own campus, The New School, for just a moment: It has been clear that, even at a liberal arts college in New York City’s Greenwich Village neighborhood, not all students are uniformly progressive, nor did their time on our campus and in our classrooms drive them leftward. On the contrary. One of my students reflected that she remembered arriving at college in 2020 and being made to “feel like a bad person” because she craved “seeing peoples’ faces without masks.” Another reflected, “Can you believe I used to be one of those kids who posted ACAB [all cops are bad]?,” in disbelief he had once parroted such slogans, a perspective that had become more nuanced due to his time discussing such issues, and living in New York City, where public safety directly affected him. A political education, especially in fraught times, can, and should, operate in multiple directions, and the Democrats would do well to speak to potential voters like these students who are thinking critically about progressivism rather than proclaiming its most popular slogans most loudly.  Such quiet disaffection with the most vocal and visible progressive perspectives is hard to capture but is important for Democrats to remember, for it challenges a common refrain that to attract younger voters, the party must move leftward. “Silent majority,” with its Nixonian echoes, is a tempting but imprecise term to use for this group that in many ways is upset about the perceived erosion of liberal mores: respectful dialogue, cultural pluralism, the importance of higher education, and of the pursuit of the unfulfilled American project.  If any generalization about young people holds true, it might be that they resist the imposition of dominant ideas. Thus, it makes sense that the “F Trump” sensibility that so galvanized Democratic support among young people in 2016 and 2020 is less passionate, as it has become at least nominally institutionalized in many educational institutions like the one where I work. To young people who have now spent a good chunk of their teen years hearing, often from powerful people like celebrities or educators, that resisting Trump is the morally correct position, acting otherwise at the ballot box and in their lives might carry an enticing whiff of rebellion, even as his policies all but ensure a darker future for all of us.  Democrats would do well to make crystal clear why young people who care about, and want to contribute to, the future of this nation can count on the party, with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at its helm, to support them. To do anything else only stands to entrench our political polarization more dangerously for a generation to come, by  keeping desperately needed young people away from voting Democratic, or away from the polls entirely."
Why Harris’ polls performance might be more than a ‘honeymoon’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/election-2024-trump-harris-swing-states-poll-numbers-rcna166610,"Since she catapulted to the top of the Democrats’ ticket last month, Vice President Kamala Harris has been quickly closing the gap with former President Donald Trump in polls. After President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, it was looking like Democrats would be routed. Harris has essentially made it a tied race again. The big question, though, is whether her campaign’s momentum can be sustained till November and, crucially, if it translates into votes in the states that will decide the election. There’s reason for Democrats to be hopeful. A New York Times/Siena College poll released this week shows major gains from Harris in three key swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. According to the survey, Harris now leads Trump in those states by 4 percentage points — 50% to 46% — among likely voters. That is within the margin of error for all three states, but those numbers are significant given Biden’s deficit last month. We’re seeing the same thing happen in three other swing states. In Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, Harris is either leading or tied with Trump, according to a survey released this week by The Cook Political Report. Things are also swinging Harris’ way in the national polls, according to an aggregate from FiveThirtyEight. A recent Substack article from Nate Silver highlighted how much of a shift this has been compared to last month, with Harris climbing almost 12 points in Arizona polls. (For the record, NBC News hasn’t released a national survey since Biden dropped out, but in its most recent poll conducted in July, in a then-hypothetical question about what voters might do if Biden discontinued his campaign, Harris was running behind Trump, 47% to 45%, with a margin of error of 3.46%.) It remains true that polls don’t tell the whole story and that there’s a risk in Democrats’ thinking that Harris has Trump cornered. Among those reportedly trying to tamp down the enthusiasm is Trump’s top pollster, Tony Fabrizio, as his boss has started to fret about Harris’ surge. “Mr. Fabrizio has predicted to campaign colleagues that Ms. Harris will have another two to three good weeks, through the Democratic National Convention, and then her poll numbers will turn in the other direction,” The New York Times reports. There’s a solid bit of wisdom baked into Fabrizio’s claims that can’t be dismissed as pure cope. It’s been well documented that a post-convention polling bounce exists, one that often provides a greater benefit for the candidate whose party goes second. Notably, the effect has dwindled over the years, as polarization has hardened voters’ partisan preferences. And as with all things election-related, there’s plenty that can happen between the nomination and Election Day that could send polls spiraling topsy-turvy again. But here’s the thing: We don’t have to take the most recent polling in isolation. Instead, we can compare the latest NYT/Siena results to a poll that the partners conducted last year, when Biden was still in the running and underwater in those key states. In October, Trump led Biden among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup by 5 points in Michigan and 6 points in Pennsylvania, while Biden had a 2-point advantage in Wisconsin. When asked about whether they would support an unnamed Democratic candidate over Trump, things shifted. Trump lost that imaginary contest in each state: 48%-41% in Michigan, 50%-40% in Pennsylvania and 51% to 39% in Wisconsin. That tracked with more recent polling that found that Biden was running behind other Democrats before exiting the race, failing to catch up with Trump even as other candidates’ numbers showed the strength of the party’s messaging. Biden supporters rightly noted then that it’s much easier to support a generic candidate than a real politician with actual positions and a record to critique. Importantly, though, the October NYT/Siena survey also polled respondents about a hypothetical matchup between Trump and Harris. At the time, Harris trailed Trump in those three states by 1 to 3 percentage points. This direct comparison suggests a continuity at work here. It wasn’t a given that Harris would find herself performing as well as or better than the generic Democrat voters were asked about in last year’s survey. For her to have taken the lead among likely voters in those swing states demonstrates that there’s more at work here than mere relief that Biden is out. Her numbers also undercut the assumption that Harris is enjoying an unsustainable boost after replacing Biden. Instead, as NBC News recently reported, her campaign is doing the work to ensure that this surge in enthusiasm is being converted into a veritable army of volunteers. The presidential race is still probably going to be a close one, in which a handful of states decide the victor. It’s much more likely to be a roller coaster between now and November. But there’s little reason to assume Harris’ current momentum owes to a “honeymoon” period that will wane long before the election, not when the polls showed so clearly that voters were seeking someone other than Biden to take on Trump."
The Marion newspaper raid highlights the bravery of small-town journalists,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 3:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kansas-newspaper-getting-justice-illegal-police-raid-rcna166409,"A year after he led a fateful raid on the office of the Marion County, Kansas, Record newspaper and its publisher’s home, former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody was finally charged with a crime. A government’s attacking the free press cannot be tolerated, so it’s encouraging that in a time when journalists are routinely maligned and threatened, the special prosecutors assigned to the case charged Cody with wrongdoing, specifically interference with the judicial process. They say the chief asked a woman — whose driving record the newspaper had been looking into — to delete incriminating text messages they’d exchanged with one another. It’s a low-level felony, but Cody’s not being charged with anything would have dishonored the memory of the 98-year-old co-owner of the Record, Joan Meyer, who yelled “Get out of my house!” to police raiding her home. She died the next day from what her family says was the stress of the encounter. Though prosecutors didn’t pin Meyer’s death on the police and their raid, the newspaper’s publisher, Eric Meyer, in a lawsuit links Cody’s actions to his mother’s death. The raid on the Record is a reminder that small-town journalists are among the bravest in the field. Exposing the scandals of heads of state and corporate titans is a low-risk, high-reward venture compared with calling out the misdeeds of, say, the winning football coach-turned-school board member or the beloved boy-done-good contractor. Especially when you know you’ll run into them or somebody close to them at the grocery store or the middle school band recital. Marion has an estimated 1,900 people, Marion County about 12,000. To conduct professional journalism in such small places takes a fearlessness that most journalists will never have to muster. Based on a tip, the Record was looking into whether a local restaurateur’s DUI and record of a suspended license disqualified her from getting a liquor license. A Record reporter obtained the woman’s publicly available driving record. The paper didn't run a story based on those records, but then the police (emboldened by a warrant that should never have been signed) decided that journalists examining public records had committed identity theft. In his lawsuit, the newspaper’s publisher, who’s also a college journalism professor, accuses the mayor of prompting the police chief to investigate the newspaper. Two weeks before the fateful raid, according to reporting by the news sites Kansas Reflector and The Handbasket, the mayor of Marion had said in a Facebook post on his personal page that the “real villains in America ... are the radical ‘journalists,’ ‘teachers’ and ‘professors’ who do nothing but sow division between the American people.” The police chief resigned in October when NBC affiliate KSHB of Kansas City reported that he had told the restaurant owner to erase the text messages they’d exchanged. The mayor decided against seeking re-election. The attack on the Record is also a reminder that small-town newspapers are disappearing, and fast. According to a November report from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern, the loss of 2.5 local newspapers a week last year means “more than half of all U.S. counties now have limited access to reliable local news and information.” That report found that 228 more counties are “at high risk of losing local news.” The disappearance of local news not only leaves people more in the dark about what’s happening around them, but it also foments the kind of cutthroat partisanship that we’ve seen play out at school board meetings and city council meetings. If the only news people get concerns Democrats and Republicans in Washington fighting tooth and nail, then they’re more likely to filter everything local through the same polarizing lens. My journalism career began at a weekly newspaper not unlike the Marion Record, and the first crime story I wrote made me aware that journalism wasn’t as safe as I’d assumed. I quoted the sheriff in my part of rural Mississippi boasting of his department’s recovery of stolen goods at an unnamed pawnshop. The exceedingly large owner of another local pawnshop felt wrongly implicated and wanted an audience with me, the 17-year-old summer intern. As my editor was describing how he’d previously burst through the door yelling — and promising to order me to hide if she saw him approaching — I saw her eyes focus on the door behind me, and she said, “Oh, my God, here he comes!” From my hiding place, I heard her explain that the sheriff had declined to give the name of the pawn shop, and I heard him vow to come back and raise hell if the sheriff didn’t confirm what she said. There was no warning the next time. The office stood frozen as he threw the door open, stuck his head inside and said the sheriff had confirmed what she’d said and that he no longer had it out for me. In the decades since, I’ve written things that have upset big-city mayors, governors and members of Congress. But I can attest, as I’m sure Meyer can, that offending high-ranking officials is nothing compared to getting crosswise with local small-town potentates. The good news is that the readership of the Record has tripled since the raid: from 2,000 subscribers to 6,000. Still, Meyer is seeking $5 million in his lawsuit and says he doesn’t want to settle. He wants a precedent-setting verdict against those behind the raid. He said"" “The whole point of doing this is not to get money. The whole point of doing this is to say ‘you can’t do this crap.’”"
Republicans are stuck with Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 2:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republicans-stuck-donald-trump-democrats-rcna166597,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" The Republican Party is stuck with Donald Trump. Now, they won’t say that publicly and they didn’t feel that way three weeks ago when many Republicans were talking about winning New Jersey and thinking about what jobs they would have in the second Trump administration. But a lot has changed since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the Democratic side of the ticket. Trump is now losing a race that he was clearly winning before.  Let’s not overstate things. Trump is behind in the national polling lead and he’s behind in the key swing states but all of the leads are narrow. The race is still — because of the nature of American politics — close. As we have just seen in the last three weeks, things can change radically very quickly.            One of the themes of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s short-lived presidential campaign still rings prescient. Haley frequently said that most Americans did not want a Trump-Biden rematch. She even predicted, “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.” Remember that line? There was some real insight there. And it’s transferred to what you see in the polls. Trump is now the oldest man to run for a four-year term as president. He’s older today than Ronald Reagan was when he left office. And Trump has been doing the exact same shtick since 2015. He is very obviously deteriorating in terms of his capacity and his energy — as we saw in his glitchy, rambling, difficult-to-understand audio conversation with Elon Musk on Monday. During that conversation, Trump delivered important public policy messages to the American people like: That appearance was the culmination of a three-week stretch in which Trump still attacked Biden, who, remember, is no longer running against him. He spread downright ludicrous and comical conspiracy theories falsely claiming the Harris campaign faked the size of its crowds with artificial intelligence. He suggested she only became a Black person recently, which is a racist lie, but also a weird product of a brain that’s been scrambled like eggs. Trump is the same guy he’s always been. Yet, Republicans still think he’s capable of being someone else entirely. I have, personally, covered seemingly hundreds of “new tone for Donald Trump” news cycles over all those years. Most recently, we heard it after he survived a genuinely terrifying assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. In the lead-up to the Republican National Convention, we heard that he’d changed. He’d mellowed. He was all about unity. As one convention delegate told reporters, “The real estate salesman, I think, is a different person. ... It’s a good thing. Humility goes a long way in politics and it attracts far more people ... I think he’s seeing God.” Sound familiar? Haven’t we been hearing this stuff for the better part of a decade? Like when CNN’s Van Jones praised Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, claiming he “became president of the United States in that moment, period.” Seven years. We’ve been doing this for seven years. At this point, it’s like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  And yet, if you listen to what Republican insiders are still telling reporters, they want Trump to do a pivot. They want him to be more disciplined. They want him to be more presidential. And this time, it will be for real.  This week, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Trump should stop questioning the size of Harris’ crowds at rallies and focus on the issues.  Fox Business host Larry Kudlow and former Trump aide turned Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway shared a similar sentiment, practically begging the former president to stay on message. And former Vice President Mike Pence had to remind his party that they can win “at every level by speaking the truth to [voters] respectfully.” “I have some familiarity with that; I did it for four years,” Pence said. The former vice president was threatened with hanging for it, but yes, he kept it respectful. Pence of all people should know you can’t change Trump. Yet people keep falling into the same old trap.  Even the people who joined the Trump 2024 bandwagon at its peak right after the convention. Some of those supporters showed up to a Trump fundraiser earlier this month on Long Island, including billionaire hedge funders like Bill Ackman. According to The New York Times, at the dinner that evening: I’ll say this for Trump: He has more awareness about himself than a shocking number of people in Republican politics. He won’t change.  Do you know who else understands this? Voters. Like the ones in a focus group held after Trump’s first joint address to Congress and the nation as president in 2017. The one that pundits like Jones called so “presidential.” One voter told CBS News, “That is no way the real Donald Trump. The real Donald Trump will surface in probably less than two hours.” Another said the next thing Trump needed to do was “delete his Twitter feed.”  When asked if they did not like the way Trump behaved on Twitter, almost the entire room raised their hands.  In advance of Monday's Twitter show with Musk, Trump got back to posting on the site. You know, the platform he was kicked off of for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. Meanwhile, the Democrats have something new — an open horizon in front of them as they enter a convention united, with a popular energetic ticket and a messaging opportunity that we have not seen in our lifetimes.

Rick Perry while he was stumping outside a Houston-area anti-abortion pregnancy center, has been on my mind a lot over the past few days, thanks to new evidence showing more people are having abortions today than before Donald Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The latest Society of Family Planning #WeCount report shows in-person and telehealth abortion care with clinical supervision have increased, and new research out of the University of California-San Francisco shows self-managed abortion care is also becoming more common post-Roe. As a means of eliminating abortion in the United States, the Dobbs decision and the resulting proliferation of state-level abortion restrictions and bans seem to have failed spectacularly. Today, Rick Perry’s political career is more a “thing of the past” than is abortion care. But I am not given to believe that eliminating abortion was ever the goal of the anti-abortion movement or of the Republican (and some Democrat) politicians who have backed abortion bans and sought to criminalize care.  It’s more clear than ever — and it’s been plenty clear for a while — that anti-abortion politics and policies are about punishment, predominantly for perceived noncompliance with Christian, patriarchal sexual customs. Rhetoric around eliminating abortion, more recently couched by anti-abortion propagandists as making abortion “unthinkable,” is a smokescreen. It’s intended to divert attention away from the deeply misogynist, oppressive heart of anti-abortion thinking and policymaking, which are primarily concerned with writing the subjugation of pregnant people into law. The sooner the public — including the Beltway press and mainstream and legacy journalists, pundits and public intellectuals — get their heads around this, the better positioned we’ll all be to stamp out the GOP’s sexist chicanery and get moving on pro-abortion-rights and pro-family policies that will really make positive differences in people’s lives. But I worry we’re still a long way away. I was struck by a recent column in The Hill by the conservative law professor Andrew Koppelman, who wrote that “pro-life voters, who want more than anything else to minimize the number of abortions,” should vote for Kamala Harris. Now, sure: anyone whose goal is to “minimize” abortions would do well to support practically any Democrat over practically any Republican. Dems have long backed common-sense policies that enable people to make decisions about their reproductive lives that are less likely to result in unplanned pregnancies, from improving contraceptive access to promoting evidence-based sex education. And of course, Democrats also back the safety-net policies and institutions that are more likely to enable people who want to become pregnant and experience parenthood to do so.    But presuming “pro-life voters” are those who “want more than anything else to minimize the number of abortions” begs the question to an incredible, even irresponsible, degree. Voters — and politicians — who oppose abortion have had the same opportunities anyone else does to support access to contraception, sex education, and safety-net programs. But, again and again, they’ve chosen not to. Perhaps they have other priorities — such as enriching America’s modern-day robber barons, attacking transgender kids and adults, or accelerating climate disaster to the benefit of the oil and gas industry. Even then, ushering in climate change and supporting bodily autonomy are hardly mutually exclusive. There’s plainly another motivation at play here: rank misogyny. The regressive, conservative desire to control strangers’ sexual behavior — especially women’s sexual behavior and our reproductive capacities — makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than the knotty mental gymnastics required to reconcile crowing about making abortion “unthinkable” with voting against the Right to Contraception Act. That people who do not wish to remain pregnant at the behest of the government have found the means to do so even after the fall of Roe is a testament to the ingenuity, resilience and resourcefulness of pregnant people themselves, and of the reproductive health, rights and justice movements and their political supporters, and especially of local abortion funds. Despite the closure of hundreds of clinics between the onset of TRAP laws in the early 2010s and the Dobbs decision, medical providers — notably, mostly independent clinics — have done all they can to stretch their capacity in places where abortion remains legal. Telemedicine shield laws are keeping options open for folks living in the most abortion-hostile geographies. Doulas, educators, accompaniers and other supporters of safe self-managed abortion care are sharing information despite the odds, and at great legal risk. But we should not assume the new data from SFP and UCSF means that everyone who needs an abortion can get one or can get care by the means they would prefer. There will always be abortions, and there always should be abortions, as many as are necessary to ensure that people have complete control over their reproductive lives. Even with abortion numbers going up, that’s not the case. We’re in a new status quo, and it’s totally unacceptable, and untenable in the long term (and the long term could be shorter than we think, with a Trump-Vance presidential ticket on the line). We know that, post-Dobbs, tens of thousands of people are likely being forced to carry pregnancies to term when they would have chosen otherwise. Infant deaths are on the rise, with thousands of families navigating terrible, and unnecessary, trauma and grief as a direct result of abortion bans. So-called “exceptions” to abortion bans, for rape or incest or medical emergencies, are demonstrably inadequate; even people with unviable ectopic pregnancies are being turned away by medical facilities unwilling to run afoul of abortion bans. Forced pregnancy, rising infant deaths and the despicable treatment of pregnant people seeking urgent medical care have one thing in common, and it isn’t reducing abortion: it’s the anti-abortion movement’s sadistic obsession with the subjugation of women."
Donald Trump's anti-worker rhetoric could help Kamala Harris win the White House,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 1:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-musk-harris-walz-union-workers-rcna166617,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight.” On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held his first solo campaign event since joining the Democratic ticket. Walz addressed one of the country’s largest public sector unions, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  For years now, unions have been big fans of Walz. As governor of Minnesota, he banned noncompete agreements and guaranteed paid sick days for workers. He made it so companies can’t force workers to attend meetings where they argue against unionizing. The guy has even joined picket lines. The reason I bring all of this up is because it stands in sharp contrast to how the other side of this race thinks about labor.  On Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sat for a livestreamed interview with the billionaire owner of Tesla and the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk. In the past few years alone, Musk has fired nearly 80% of Twitter’s workforce. He’s also been found liable in court for illegally firing a Tesla worker who was trying to form a union.  During his conversation with Musk, Trump offered his take on those job cuts, calling Musk “the greatest cutter.” “I mean, I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t mention the name of the company — but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK, you’re all gone.’” On Tuesday, the United Auto Workers union filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk for that statement. The group’s president put out a statement that said, bluntly, “When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean.” The United Auto Workers has already endorsed Harris. With their backing — and the backing of other labor organizations like the UAW — the Harris-Walz campaign may just be able to buttress the ""blue wall"" and win in November.

The familiar trap Kamala Harris needs to avoid to defeat Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-avoid-democrats-trap-donald-trump-rcna166590,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" No one should confuse the enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for a lack of substance.  Harris knows her stuff. She knows where this country needs to go. I’m sure her campaign will lay out detailed policy positions very soon. Those policies will be posted to her website, for the American people to research and think about for themselves.  But Harris needs to be careful here. As a former Democratic senator, I know all too well the trap members of my party sometimes fall into. Democrats think, well, if I can just give one more detail about how we’re going to convert green energy into jobs or if I could just give the voters one more in-the-weeds factoid then that will do it. However, that approach will not appeal to the people who will decide who takes the White House. These people are not high-information voters. Many of the voters who will actually decide this election likely won’t pay attention until the final 60 days of the campaign. So while Harris has to have that substance ready to go, she also needs to keep her campaign where it is now in terms of messaging — “We’re not going back. We’re going forward. This is about you and it’s not about him.” That is what will likely convince the voters that Harris needs to win the White House in November.

MAGA podcaster Royce White's primary win is disastrous for Minnesota Republicans,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 12:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/royce-white-republican-minnesota-senate-primary-win-rcna166607,"On Tuesday night, Minnesota Republicans sealed their fate as a pro-extremist party when they officially voted for bigoted podcaster Royce White as their nominee for one of Minnesota's Senate seats. The win is a political comeback of sorts for White, who waged a failed GOP primary bid in 2022 in the race to represent Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, a seat held by Rep. Ilhan Omar. But White’s win this year arguably makes a GOP loss in the Senate race more likely.  White defeated Joe Fraser, who was running as a more mainstream, normal-sounding Republican — who, Fraser argued, would give the party a chance in the general election against incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar.  White, on the other hand, is a former college basketball player who had a cup of coffee in the NBA before dropping out of the league over a conflict around his anxiety disorder. He’s since become an internet-based conspiracy theorist and the host of an aptly titled podcast, “Please, Call Me Crazy.” White (who is Black) is a mentee of far-right Trump adviser Steve Bannon and sees himself as a MAGA evangelist in Bannon’s hapless effort to lure Black men toward conservative Republicanism. One of the ways White has sought to do that is through rank misogyny. I wrote earlier this year about how White went viral over comments he made in a resurfaced podcast interview with Bannon, in which White claimed women have become “too mouthy” these days. Politically speaking, White is a walking red flag who is likely to provide his opponent with what seems like a library’s worth of sound bites to work with in the coming months. That includes his use of homophobic and misogynistic slurs to attack people online, his antisemitic rhetoric, his embrace of 9/11 conspiracy theories, and it's possible that his use of campaign funds at a Miami strip club in 2022 could come up. All these things were widely known before Tuesday. But a plurality of GOP voters in Minnesota rejected Fraser's electability argument. Instead, they selected an outspoken devotee of Donald Trump’s hypermasculine cult of personality, spurning the moderate candidate who might have given them a puncher’s chance at winning a Senate seat this fall."
Is the Harris-Walz campaign making political merch great again?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 11:04 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-tim-walz-camo-hat-rcna166260,"During the 2016 election, I recall sitting on the beach with friends in a Jersey Shore town that was split down the middle between Republicans and Democrats. Someone told a joke: “How can you spot a Trump supporter?” The punchline: “Because they’ll show you.” The person was referring, of course, to the bright red ""Make America Great Again"" baseball hat that had just made political and cultural landfall. Today, the accessory is as ubiquitous as ever. While fashion has long been a medium to express personal ideology, political or otherwise, the MAGA hat ushered in something different. What may have begun as merely political support for a presidential candidate became a salient symbol of exclusion, divisiveness and an invitation for heated debate. There is no single item that is more of a political and cultural juggernaut than the MAGA hat. But now it could have a challenger. A $40 camouflage baseball hat baring HARRIS WALZ in orange, boldfaced print sold out in 30 minutes last week. As of Thursday, sales reportedly totaled nearly $2 million including pre-order sales. I’m sure that number has since grown. Singer Bon Iver wore one to perform at a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I saw at least one on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. For certain Americans in liberal enclaves across the country, the cap is already a status symbol. Not to evoke Harris’ most viral moment to date, but the camo hat exists in a cultural context, joining a trend that is already seeing an incredible upswing. While camouflage never truly exits the general fashion milieu, it’s enjoying a real moment. This is especially true for men’s fashion, so-called Carhartt-core, in its embrace of ‘90s-era military trends and a subversion of traditionally masculine pieces that perpetually exist outside of high-end fashion. (Look at any TikTok fluent Angeleno or Bushwick transplant for some combination of white ribbed tank top, oversized well-worn jacket, and heavy, silver chain jewelry.) This aesthetic, camouflage baseball cap included, originated as practical and durable workwear for blue-collar Americans — a voting bloc that has been steadily leaving the Democratic Party since at least 2012. Walz’s place in the Harris campaign is clear: He is to be that Midwest everyman, that average-above-average working-class guy. And by, all accounts, he genuinely is. Walz even wore a black T-shirt, sneakers and, yes, a camouflage baseball cap, in the campaign video commemorating his place as a Harris’ vice presidential pick. The choice has sparked a lot of notable reactions. Meghan McCain, daughter of the late politician John McCain, seemed to read it as a grab for working-class voters, posting on X: “Putting someone in a camo hat doesn’t make them a moderate or appealing to red-state people. No one is that dumb.” That statement can be picked apart in another article, but it’s worth noting that even if McCain’s jaded assessment of the cap were entirely true, it still is an embrace of “red-state people,” as she calls them. That alone separates it from the inherent exclusivity of the MAGA hat. Then there’s Chappell Roan. The Missouri-born 26-year-old singer has emerged as the breakout star of the summer. Chappell Roan, already a cultural, fashion and LGBTQ+ icon in her own right, famously rejected an invitation to the White House to perform for a Pride celebration, citing her belief in “freedom in trans rights, that means freedom in women’s rights, and it especially means freedom for all oppressed people in occupied territories.” The official merch for her “Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess Tour”: a camouflage baseball with hat orange, boldfaced embroidered letters spelling “Midwest Princess.” In an alternate reality, in a timeline where the Harris-Walz campaign hadn’t already proven to be extraordinarily meme-literate and internet savvy, perhaps this camo baseball hat would merely be a bid to appeal to those lost working-class voters and a true celebration of Walz’s Midwestern background. We aren’t in that timeline. On the one hand, this hat is confirmation that the Harris-Walz campaign understands the social currency of trends and the power of virality. On the other, it signals, yet again, that the campaign is dedicated to appealing to the sprawling Gen-Z voting bloc. Many a political pundit and research poll have emphasized the power these young voters have to shape the election, and Harris is clearly listening. This is the second time in the month since Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee that she has embraced a powerful, young and zeitgeist-y singer. It’s naïve to believe that effective use of campaign merch is enough to win Gen-Z voters, long painted as fickle and disillusioned, the first generation of ostensibly liberal-leaning voters that won’t vote blue just for the sake of voting blue. Or that a trendy fashion statement will entice the votes of so-called red state people. But the hats are still selling. And they remain a powerful symbol for the reach and cultural impact of the Harris-Walz campaign in ways we can’t ignore."
Lawyers are rarely kicked off cases. This pro-Trump one just was.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 10:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-removes-pro-trump-lawyer-dominion-lawsuit-rcna166552,"Michigan lawyer Stefanie Lambert was already facing multiple criminal charges in that state stemming from the 2020 presidential election. Now, she’s been disqualified from representing a client in a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems in Washington, D.C., regarding allegedly false statements about the company’s role in that election. The company sued Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne for his baseless claims that Dominion ran the 2020 election, that its technology was developed by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and that it hired a truck to shred 3,000 pounds of ballots. Dominion said those statements were false and not only harmed the company’s reputation and business but also resulted in serious threats to its employees, their families, and election workers. It’s a high bar to disqualify a lawyer from representing a client. But Lambert cleared it for reasons explained by U.S. magistrate judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya. Indeed, the judge’s opinion Tuesday cited “at least five reasons that illustrate why Lambert’s conduct meets the high bar for disqualification”: Upadhyaya noted that Lambert had disclosed confidential Dominion case material in one of her own criminal cases and that she shared documents with a sheriff (who had no role in this litigation) who also publicly spread the information. “This is not a case of an inadvertent breach or good faith disclosure,” the judge wrote, calling it “unfathomable for Lambert to believe she could do whatever she wanted with Dominion’s Litigation Documents.” The judge also said that Byrne himself violated the protective order and that Dominion might seek sanctions against him. But Byrne wasn’t the subject of this opinion. Lambert was, in the latest example of Donald Trump-aligned lawyers facing consequences for going off the rails in the face of Trump’s 2020 election loss — some of whom might not be lawyers anymore when all is said and done.

Rep. Ilhan Omar wins primary race after two 'Squad' members' defeats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 10:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ilhan-omar-primary-minnesota-squad-israel-gaza-rcna166550,"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., handily won her primary race on Tuesday against an opponent, Don Samuels, who was boosted by fundraising from pro-Israel donors. Elected in 2018, Omar is now almost certain to clinch re-election in November to represent Minnesota’s deep-blue 5th District. She defeated Samuels in the 2022 primary. Omar told supporters on Tuesday night that she was ""incredibly honored"" by the results. “I am honored to represent the people who welcomed me and my family as refugees to this incredible state,” she said. The victory by Omar, a leading pro-Palestinian advocate in Congress and a vocal critic of Israel, comes on the heels of primary losses for Reps. Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman, fellow progressive ""Squad"" colleagues who have also condemned Israel's military assault on Gaza. Bush and Bowman were defeated by opponents backed by the pro-Israel group AIPAC. The United Democracy Project, a super PAC affiliated with the group, poured millions of dollars into both races, buying ads attacking the incumbents. Bowman's race was the most expensive House primary in history, and Bush's the second-most expensive. As a candidate, Omar had fewer obvious vulnerabilities than Bush or Bowman. After narrowly winning her primary against Samuels in 2022, she stepped up her outreach to voters and spent more on ads. Another factor in her race was that AIPAC sat it out; in 2022, the United Democracy Project spent $350,000 trying to oust Omar. In AIPAC's absence, wealthy pro-Israel donors stepped in to raise funds for Samuels’ campaign, The Intercept reported this week. Samuels' campaign received a boost in donations after Wesley Bell won his primary against Bush last week, but Omar's financial prowess proved insurmountable."
Judge Merchan rejects Trump’s recusal bid — again — ahead of sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 6:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-merchan-trump-recusal-rejection-rcna166190,"Judge Juan Merchan again declined to recuse himself from Donald Trump’s New York criminal case, rejecting the former president’s third attempt to get rid of the presiding judge in his so-called hush money case. Refusing to step aside in a decision dated Tuesday, Merchan called the GOP presidential nominee's arguments ""nothing more than a repetition of stale and unsubstantiated claims."" The judge noted that he was reiterating, ""for the third time, that which should already be clear - innuendo and mischaracterizations do not a conflict create. Recusal is therefore not necessary, much less required."" Merchan not only rejected the motion, but also called out Trump's counsel in the process. While noting that he welcomed zealous advocacy and creative lawyering, he recalled in his ruling that ""counsel has been warned repeatedly that such advocacy must not come at the expense of professional responsibility in one's role as an officer of the court."" The judge added: ""Counsel has merely repeated arguments that have already been denied by this and higher courts. Defense Counsel's reliance, and apparent citation to his own prior affirmation, rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims, is unavailing."" Trump’s latest recusal attempt, filed by defense lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, cited the fact of Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee as a reason for the judge to step aside because of his daughter’s political campaign-related work. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office called the defense move “a vexatious and frivolous attempt to relitigate an issue that was twice addressed by this Court in orders that the First Department then refused to disturb,” referring to the New York state appeals court. “Defendant identifies no new facts or changes in the law that warrant a different outcome,” the prosecution wrote to Merchan ahead of his ruling, pointing out that Trump’s previous motions already argued that Harris was Trump’s political opponent and that Merchan’s daughter would benefit from rulings in this case. The denial moves Trump one step closer to sentencing. But first, Merchan will need to rule on another Trump motion, to set aside his guilty verdicts in light of the Supreme Court's ruling granting broad presidential immunity. If Merchan also rejects that motion, sentencing would proceed on Sept. 18 on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, an “E” felony (the lowest-level New York state felony) that doesn’t mandate incarceration. Sentencing was supposed to happen in July, but the immunity decision pushed it back, raising the question of whether evidence was improperly introduced at trial that ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s newly concocted presidential immunity rule. Merchan will answer that complex question in the first instance in his ruling due Sept. 16, though the Supreme Court may eventually have the final word in all of Trump’s cases in which he invokes immunity.

Trump campaign downplays travel on Jeffrey Epstein’s old plane,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 14, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-campaign-jeffrey-epstein-old-plane-rcna166462,"Former President Donald Trump and his campaign broke one of the most obvious unwritten rules of electioneering: never do anything to remind voters of your previous, yet-to-be-fully-explained relationship with one of the world’s most notorious child molesters. Nonetheless, the Trump campaign says it has a perfectly good reason the candidate recently used a plane previously owned by the late Jeffrey Epstein to get to various campaign stops, as the Miami Herald reported.  According to the report:  The Herald went into a bit more detail later in the report, explaining how Trump’s decals had been placed on Epstein’s old plane so it resembled the one he owns.  Per the Herald: So there you have it, folks. Sure, Trump has flown on Epstein’s private jets plenty of times in the past, for reasons that remain unclear. But this time is different from all those times in that this one might just be coincidental. Glad the Trump camp cleared that up.  Still, I’d argue anything that even potentially reminds voters of Trump’s past experiences partying with Epstein or the fact Trump wished Epstein’s co-conspirator well in his sex trafficking case could be considered an own goal at this point."
