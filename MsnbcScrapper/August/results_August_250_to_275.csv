Kamala Harris faces huge test on Gaza at DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 2:52 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-dnc-test-israel-gaza-rcna167217,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 18 episode of ""Ayman."" As the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago, polls show that the presidential race is shifting in Democrats’ favor. Since President Joe Biden dropped out, the party has rallied around Vice President Kamala Harris and public opinion has followed.  The emergence of Harris as a presidential contender and the selection of Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate have breathed new life into the Democratic Party — injecting supporters with excitement, hope and even joy.  However, a lot can change between now and November. Harris is still in a neck-and-neck race with Donald Trump, a man convicted of 34 felony counts who tried to overturn the last election. It’s clear the stakes of this convention couldn’t be any higher. In her first few weeks as the Democratic nominee, Harris has already proven herself capable of making big and bold decisions. When most Democratic strategists wanted her to pick a running mate with the pundit-approved label of “centrist” or “moderate,” she went her own way and selected Walz, who has successfully passed a progressive agenda as governor.  Last week, knowing that Republicans stood ready to label her a socialist or even a communist, she unveiled a populist economic agenda, including a plan to combat price gouging by grocery store chains. However, there is one issue on which she has not yet displayed this boldness or willingness to confront powerful interests. It’s the same issue that sunk Biden in the polls long before his disastrous debate performance. As Farah Stockman wrote in The New York Times: The key word there is “substance.” Harris has already proven adept at showing more compassion and empathy toward Palestinians than does Biden, who came across to some as cold, cruel and clueless.  But that bar is extremely low. Empty words won’t bring back the more than 40,000 Palestinians, including more than 16,000 children, who have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in these last 10 months, according to health officials in Gaza. The American position can’t be “I feel your pain” while we’re the ones supplying bombs causing that pain. That’s why more than 150 groups nationwide have joined a coalition to march at the DNC with estimates that tens of thousands will be there protesting. How Harris and the Democrats deal with this — not just the protests themselves but the substance of this issue — may be her biggest test heading into the DNC."

Cease-fire talks have reached a ‘decisive moment,’ Blinken said as he met with Israeli leaders on his ninth trip to the Middle East since the fighting began.” * Remember him? “Former Republican U.S. Rep.

Sasse, who abruptly resigned from the post in July, issued a defense of his leadership in a 1,745-word message on social media, one day after Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis suggested expenditures should be probed.” * The ongoing effects of Roe’s demise: “Two women have filed complaints against two Texas hospitals for allegedly denying them treatment for ectopic pregnancies, which they say put their lives at risk and breached federal law.” * An update to a story I recently wrote about: “When lawyers for Elon Musk’s ‘X Corp.’ filed an antitrust lawsuit against advertisers in the Wichita Falls division of the Northern District of Texas, the case was destined for U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, who has several right-wing rulings to his resume. But the apparent judge-shopping was foiled Tuesday when O’Connor recused himself from the case. Why did he do so? His brief filing didn’t say.” * Hmm: “FBI agents have raided and searched the Virginia home of Dimitri Simes, an author and policy analyst, who advised Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign and who currently hosts a current affairs program on Russia’s state-run Channel One. The raid began on 13 August, the FBI told the local Rappahannock News, which first reported the story.” * A friend of mine named Rachel Maddow has a new op-ed in The New York Times that you should definitely read.

Cornel West's campaign exposing right-wing trickery as it implodes,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 2:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cornel-west-arizona-republicans-presidential-election-2024-rcna167252,"Cornel West’s presidential campaign appears to be combusting — and, in the process, exposing some mischievous inner workings. The unaffiliated West was disqualified from appearing on the ballot in Michigan last week over notary issues and amid concerns about the authenticity of the signatures he acquired. Now, The Associated Press reports that West has been disqualified in Arizona, as well — but the story of the last-ditch effort to keep West on the ballot out there speaks to the dubiousness of his MAGA-fueled campaign.  The report explains how conservative activists tried to coordinate electors willing to help West get on ballots this November in an apparent effort to pull potential liberal votes from the Democratic candidate. This follows an NBC News report in June claiming operatives aligned with Republicans had been working to obtain signatures to qualify West in various states.  Per The Associated Press: Late last week, Mitchell claimed her signature had been “forged” on documents identifying her as a potential elector for West. The latest AP report says attorney Paul Hamrick spoke with Judie via phone and that well-known conservative lawyers Amanda Reeve and Brett Johnson were captured on surveillance footage visiting Judie’s home after he allegedly backed out of an offer to support West as an elector. The Associated Press describes the attempt to recruit electors for West as what “appears to be part of a broader effort by conservative activists and Republican-aligned operatives across the country to push West’s candidacy and subvert the integrity of the ballot in the months leading up to November’s presidential election.” Hamrick told the AP that the allegations against him are “false,” while the two other lawyers didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The conservative chicanery being alleged has always seemed highly likely, considering how West’s campaign began. When West launched his presidential bid last year, I explained his campaign’s curious ties to the conservative movement, including his praise for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ultraconservative education agenda, his association with right-wing conspiracy theorist Russell Brand, and the fact he initially launched his bid as a member of the far-right-friendly People’s Party. That West received a maximum donation from conservative megadonor Harlan Crow — and returned it after facing backlash — only added to the suspicion.  And Trump, for the record, is acutely aware that long-shot, ostensibly liberal candidates such as West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein being in the race only helps him. But now, more than ever, we're seeing the lengths conservatives have been willing to travel to prop up West, with hopes they can use him to help Trump win."
Donald Trump says America is in decline. He couldn't be more wrong.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 1:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/donald-trump-america-decline-republicans-rcna167237,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 19 episode of ""Morning Joe."" On Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump once again called the United States a “nation in decline.”  For any Republicans out there who may want to follow down Trump’s trail, let me give you some facts: America is a great nation, and the overwhelming majority of Americans — the ones who will be voting for or against you this fall — agree with me. We have fed and freed more people through the years than any other country on the planet. We are economically stronger relative to the rest of the world. The Dow is higher than it’s ever been — far higher than when Trump was president. Trump loves to say, “Drill, baby, drill,” and although some Democrats may not like it, if you look at the U.S. and its oil production, we have produced more oil this past year than any other country in history.  We are also the strongest military power in the world. Even our enemies understand we’re not a nation in decline. Trump is always talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin and what a great leader he is. But the fact is, Texas has a higher GDP than the entirety of Russia. Culturally, there’s also America’s reach in soft power. Just look at Taylor Swift going through Europe and the economic boom that is for those countries. It’s exhausting to hear Trump and other Republicans say we’re a failing country. It’s not true. America is stronger than it’s ever been. I challenge Trump to find a measurement that would suggest we’re a nation in decline. It’s a strange form of patriotism to say that America is only great if one leader is in power, and that if that leader is not in power then America is in decline. But that’s what you have with their side."
Former GOP Rep. George Santos pleads guilty in federal fraud case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 1:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/george-santos-pleads-guilty-federal-fraud-case-rcna167131,"Former Republican U.S. Rep. George Santos pleaded guilty in federal court on Monday, avoiding a trial that was set for next month on criminal charges including wire fraud, false statements, aggravated identity theft and theft of public funds.    Santos pleaded guilty to two counts — wire fraud and aggravated identity theft — and faces a minimum of two years in prison, NBC News reported, with sentencing set for Feb. 7. As part of the plea agreement, Santos will pay restitution of $373,749.97 and forfeiture of $205,002.97. By pleading guilty, the expelled congressman from New York avoids potentially more severe punishment had he been found guilty at trial. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has noted that federal trial sentences “are roughly three times higher than plea sentences for the same crime on average and sometimes as much as eight or ten times higher,” and that “only 2-3% of federal convictions are the result of trial.”   While guilty pleas are common, Monday’s proceeding highlights the outlandish if brief political tenure of Santos, whose brazen lies managed to stand out even in Washington. My colleague Steve Benen pointed out, upon Santos’ congressional expulsion last year, that “Capitol Hill has featured plenty of scandal-plagued members in recent generations, but successful expulsion votes have only happened three times since the Civil War.” The expulsion followed a House ethics report that said Santos “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” In his criminal case, Santos was accused of “stealing people’s identities and making charges on his own donors’ credit cards without their authorization, lying to the [Federal Election Commission] and, by extension, the public about the financial state of his campaign,” Eastern District of New York U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in announcing a superseding indictment last year. “Santos falsely inflated the campaign’s reported receipts with non-existent loans and contributions that were either fabricated or stolen,” Peace said, adding that Santos “allegedly led multiple additional fraudulent criminal schemes, lying to the American public in the process.”  Also on Monday, a federal judge dismissed the civil lawsuit Santos brought against talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, ABC and Disney for copyright infringement and related claims. The suit stemmed from Kimmel’s use of videos on his late-night show made by Santos on the Cameo website, where celebrities record personalized messages for money. Kimmel had a segment called “Will Santos Say It?” in which the host sent a number of what he called “ridiculous requests.” “I didn’t say they were from me. I just wrote them and sent them to find out: Will Santos say it?"" Kimmel explained to his audience ahead of the segment in December 2023. Rejecting Santos’ claim, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in the Southern District of New York wrote that a reasonable observer would understand that Kimmel showed the videos “to comment on the willingness of Santos — a public figure who had recently been expelled from Congress for allegedly fraudulent activity including enriching himself through a fraudulent contribution scheme — to say absurd things for money.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Harris and Walz are hitting Trump where it hurts: his masculinity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 11:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-rally-trump-masculinity-gender-attacks-rcna167214,"During a campaign stop in Rochester, Pennsylvania, over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris lobbed a volley in her war on Donald Trump’s hypermasculine ways, criticizing the “perversion” and “coward”-like behavior undergirding the bravado. It was a nice reversal of the usual gendered rhetoric. Trump’s attacks on Harris have dripped with misogyny and general creepiness since she emerged as the Democratic nominee. He’s repeatedly insulted her intelligence; lately, he’s resorted to commenting about her physical appearance as well. Meanwhile, the campaign and allies in conservative media have tried to broaden his appeal with male voters while deploying some rather juvenile tactics. But Trump’s increasingly hypermasculine persona — a toxic mixture of Al Bundy from ""Married ... With Children"" and Biff Tannen from “Back to the Future” — arguably gives Democrats an opening. Even when President Joe Biden was still running, Democrats made concerted efforts to attack Trump’s performative masculinity and bullying behavior to discourage men from following in his path. And the Harris-Walz ticket has afforded Democrats more opportunity to attack toxic MAGA masculinity, with an uncowed woman leading the ticket and her running mate offering a comparatively kinder, more compassionate depiction of masculinity than is being offered by Trump and his followers.  And Harris launched a pointed attack of her own on Sunday, contrasting how her campaign perceives strength with how … others … do.  She said:  Harris didn’t need to mention Trump by name for viewers to know who she was referencing. The sentiment here — that bullies are cowardly and weak at heart — aligns with comments Tim Walz made about the MAGA movement when he was being considered as Harris’ potential running mate. I’m on the record with my belief that these kinds of attacks on Trumpy hypermasculinity are likely to be valuable for Democrats. Trump and his movement portray strength as the key to manhood. And we know one of his key metrics for strength is one’s ability to vanquish or humiliate his political foes. The fact a campaign led by a Black woman is taking him to task for this “perverse” idea seems likely to goad him into more misogynistic outbursts, which don’t appear to be helping him.  And simultaneously, in attacking Trump’s bullying behavior, the Harris-Walz campaign can do lasting good by arguing — to all Americans, but certainly, the men who need it most — that true power is about aiding others, not trampling on them."

Michael Luttig is not a household name, but in conservative legal circles, the retired federal judge has few rivals. As Politico noted a couple of years ago, the jurist has spent much of his adult life operating “at the top of the conservative legal world.” As regular readers might recall, Luttig served as an attorney in the Reagan White House, a clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and one of the nation’s most prominent conservative judges — overseeing clerks with familiar Republican names such as Ted Cruz and John Eastman. Not surprisingly, during some recent Republican administrations, Luttig was considered for the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, when then-Vice President Mike Pence and his team weighed their legal options after the 2020 election, the retired judge was the voice they sought out. (Luttig told them to follow the law. They did.) In the years that followed, Luttig took fresh steps to distance himself from his ostensible allies on the right, becoming one of the star witnesses in the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings. A year ago, the retired jurist said American democracy is in “grave peril” because of the radicalization of GOP politics. “American democracy simply cannot function without two equally healthy and equally strong political parties,” Luttig said last August. “So today, in my view, there is no Republican Party to counter the Democratic Party in the country.” It’s against this backdrop that the retired judge is also endorsing the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. CNN reported: “In the presidential election of 2024 there is only one political party and one candidate for the presidency that can claim the mantle of defender and protector of America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law,” Luttig wrote in a statement obtained by CNN. “As a result, I will unhesitatingly vote for the Democratic Party’s candidate for the Presidency of the United States, Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.” This comes on the heels of Harris also picking up support from two former Republican congresswomen: Virginia’s Barbara Comstock and New York’s Susan Molinari. (When the latter was asked why she’s supporting the vice president, Molinari said Harris is “smart,” “strong,” “knows how to handle herself on the world stage,” and is “not crazy.”) Two weeks ago, Republicans for Harris launched to some fanfare. The effort appears to be growing, which should probably make Trump and his team nervous."

Ari Melber will anchor from New York. At 8 p.m. ET, Rachel Maddow, Jen Psaki, Chris Hayes, Lawrence O'Donnell and Stephanie Ruhle will join the coverage. NBC News Now will stream live from the convention starting at 4 p.m. ET. And NBC News will have special coverage at 9 p.m. ET. Most major networks will offer prime-time coverage of the convention. The DNC will also stream live on its website beginning at 6:15 p.m. ET on Monday and at 7 p.m. ET for the rest of the days. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, the last night of the convention. Several high-profile Democrats are set to address the DNC, including President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and more. See the list of speakers here. Former President Donald Trump's speech on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention last month drew nearly 25.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen. It marked an increase in viewership from the final night of the 2020 RNC but a decline from his 2016 RNC speech. An estimated 24.6 million tuned in for the final night of the 2020 DNC, in which Biden formally accepted his party's presidential nomination, Nielsen said. Time will tell whether Harris’ address on Thursday pulls in a similar audience."
Manhattan prosecutors leave it to Judge Merchan whether to delay Trump’s sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-sentencing-bragg-letter-merchan-rcna167165,"Judge Juan Merchan has another tough decision to make in Donald Trump’s New York criminal case. After Trump’s lawyers last week pushed to delay sentencing in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office says it’s deferring to the judge about whether to do so. Merchan had set the former president’s sentencing for Sept. 18, two days after the judge is poised to rule on Trump’s motion to set aside his guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. In their letter last week, Trump’s lawyers said that if Merchan rejects their immunity-related motion, then they intend to immediately appeal, and they argued that it would be unfair to sentence their client in the meantime as he runs for president again. In their response made public Monday, Manhattan prosecutors disagreed with multiple points in the letter but ultimately deferred to Merchan on whether to keep the Sept. 18 sentencing. The state noted that, unlike Trump’s federal election interference case that led to the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling, the issue here isn’t whether the charged acts in the so-called hush money case are immune from prosecution; the issue in New York is whether any official-act evidence used to prove Trump’s guilt of unofficial conduct ran afoul of the high court ruling such that Trump’s guilty verdicts need to be overturned prior to sentencing. Trump was found guilty in May of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. “The Supreme Court’s recent decision did not consider whether a trial court’s ruling on that distinct evidentiary question is immediately appealable, and there are strong reasons why it should not be,” prosecutors wrote to Merchan in their letter dated Aug. 16. “Nonetheless, given the defense’s newly stated position, we defer to the Court on whether an adjournment is warranted to allow for orderly appellate litigation of that question, or to reduce the risk of a disruptive stay from an appellate court pending consideration of that question,” the prosecutors continued, adding that they’re prepared for sentencing whenever it takes place. Acknowledging the reality of the situation, prosecutors added in a footnote: So in addition to pointing out the “significant public safety and logistical steps by multiple agencies” needed to prepare for Trump’s court appearances, the prosecution’s letter suggests that keeping the Sept. 18 date could be all for naught, given Trump’s intention to immediately appeal the likely impending denial of his motion by Merchan. Of course, if Merchan sides with Trump on Sept. 16, then there won’t be a sentencing to contend with. “The defendant’s newly-stated position concerning an immediate appeal ... may mean that significant preparatory steps are taken, only to have such steps disturbed by appellate litigation,” prosecutors wrote, referring to a potential appeal of the motion on which Merchan is set to rule Sept. 16. The prosecution’s letter is the latest reminder of how broadly the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. United States can favor the GOP presidential nominee. While Trump has already benefited from that ruling, the full extent to which he does so remains to be seen in all of his criminal cases. In the meantime, Merchan has yet another difficult decision to make in this unique prosecution when it comes to this scheduling matter. The judge stressed to the parties earlier this month (before Trump’s letter last week) that the Sept. 18 date remained unchanged. The prosecution’s letter could complicate matters for the judge, but we’ll learn from Merchan himself in an order that could come anytime now.

Trump’s unsettling new question: ‘Why are we having an election?’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 10:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-unsettling-new-question-are-election-rcna167196,"By all appearances, Donald Trump really doesn’t like it when Democrats describe him as a threat to democracy, and yet, the Republican keeps saying things that reflect a degree of animosity toward the American system of government. Take the former president’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, for example. The New York Times reported: The context for these off-the-cuff comments was a bit of a mess. The GOP candidate, holding a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, was speaking about inflation when he apparently had a thought. “You know, they do polls on this stuff, and I’m at like 93%,” Trump said, referring to surveys that apparently exist in his imagination. “I said, ‘So why are we having an election? They didn’t have an election. Why are we having an election?’” And at that point, he moved on, lamenting the fact that President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Honestly, it’s not clear exactly what Trump was trying to say. Evidently, he’s still outraged that the Democratic Party didn’t go through a traditional nominating process before rallying behind Vice President Kamala Harris. The “they” in his quote, in other words, referred to his Democratic rivals. It was less obvious who Trump was referring to with “we.” To be sure, it was a rhetorical question, but “we” are having an election because that’s how we make decisions in the United States. It’s tempting to think Trump was complaining about the asymmetry — he had to go through GOP primaries and caucuses, nearly all of which he won with relative ease — but he was speaking entirely in the present tense. “Why are we having an election?” couldn’t refer to Republican nominating contests that wrapped up months ago. Charitable observers might be inclined to shrug this off, and as best as I can tell, the comments didn’t generate a lot of pickup over the weekend. But let’s not forget that Trump has spent recent weeks repeatedly saying that he and his political operation “don’t need” votes — a curious comment from a candidate for public office — which has dovetailed with his comments a few weeks ago that his Christian supporters “won’t have to vote anymore” if he wins a second term. Soon after, given a chance to walk that back, the GOP nominee instead doubled-down on the rhetoric. This is the same White House hopeful who’s raised the prospect of creating what he’s pitched as a temporary American “dictatorship,” refused to accept his electoral defeat four years ago, talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, and arguing that his rivals shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him. It’s against this backdrop that Trump asked his supporters, “Why are we having an election?” as if this were a legitimate question. It isn’t."
The head of Project 2025 called my kids' favorite playground 'anti-family',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 9:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-swampoodle-dog-park-rcna166791,"The head of a conservative think tank went out in a D.C. neighborhood one day and came away with more evidence for his view that childless liberals are leading America astray: a dog park. To be more specific, a combination dog park and playground. Located in the hip NoMa area of Washington — named for the fact that it's north of Massachusetts Avenue — Swampoodle Park is only about 8,000 square feet, making it not much larger than a convenience store parking lot. Most of the space is home to a dog park, with one side set aside for a tall, narrow playground structure. For Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, who was a major force behind the controversial Project 2025 proposals to shape a second Donald Trump term, the park's use of land is tilted too heavily in favor of purportedly childless dog owners and away from parents, something he blames in an upcoming book on “the antifamily culture shaping legislation, regulation, and enforcement,"" according to galleys obtained by Media Matters. I don't have a dog, but I do have four young kids and I live in Washington, D.C. As a result, I have been to a lot of playgrounds in the greater metro area in the last few years. I have driven as long as an hour just to try out a new playground in some distant suburb in Virginia and Maryland and always get immediate feedback from my own focus group of four kids. After all that, I consider myself something of a playground connoisseur. So trust me when I say this: Roberts is wrong. Swampoodle is awesome. Now, it's not in the top tier of D.C.-area parks. The best playgrounds are obviously the big ones: the zip line and climbing towers at the Beauvoir Playground next to the Washington National Cathedral, the cool metal structures at the Lafayette-Pointer Recreation Center, or if you're willing to head a little farther out, the Wizard of Oz-themed playground in Maryland and the superlong slides at the suburban Wheaton Regional Park. But when I'm driving around town with my kids, it's the ""green playground"" at Swampoodle that they ask about the most. If you visit the park with kids, you'll quickly see why. The playground structure that Roberts criticizes is actually an intricate maze of slides and ladders that leads kids upwards. It's such a brilliant use of a small space that the first time I went, I took multiple photos and texted them to my dad, who works as an urban planner. It's even sturdy enough for an adult man to climb around inside, or so I've heard. And that's not all. While kids are moving up the structure — their favorite direction — they can see the dogs. More than a few games of tag on the playground have come to an abrupt halt because the kids wanted to gawk at a particularly cute Labradoodle puppy running around the dog park next door. Roberts is right that this area of D.C. could use more parks. Once a rundown part of town, it rapidly developed when local property owners rallied to add a Metro station. Block-sized apartment buildings with a Starbucks store on the first floor sprung up seemingly overnight. The city surely missed a chance years ago to set aside some of that land for green space before property values skyrocketed. But that didn't stop its new residents. A few years ago, they began treating an undeveloped lot as an informal dog park. Eventually they joined together to petition the city to make it official. During that process, someone suggested that they add a playground and everyone agreed that was a good idea. The name Swampoodle, which comes from a nickname Irish immigrants had for the swampy puddle-filled area back in the day, was then chosen through a public vote. Earlier this year, the park was even expanded across the street with a new section for younger kids. The nonprofit that supports the park, Friends of NoMa Dogs, put out a response to the book, noting that many residents have both dogs and kids and that everyone appreciates the ""family-friendly environment where pets and kids can safely play."" In Roberts' book, he describes a country in which people without children and people with children are at war, with selfish apartment-dwelling liberal dog owners scheming to deprive long-suffering conservative parents of valuable resources. It's a zero-sum vision of politics that's also being promoted by vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who sees ""childless cat ladies"" as a problem. The United States could do more to be family-friendly, as thoughtful conservatives like Tim Carney have written. But the very park Roberts singles out to criticize disproves his argument that this is because of some kind of aggressive war on families by the childless. Swampoodle is great for dogs and kids. The next time Roberts walks by a playground he doesn't like, he should check to see if the kids actually like it."

Even plenty of Republicans have admitted as much. Following months of humiliating failures, Politico reported in the spring that behind the scenes, GOP officials were quietly admitting that House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer’s impeachment crusade had been “hobbled by embarrassing setbacks.” Punchbowl News, meanwhile, quoted a House Republican leadership aide who said Comer and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan were “becoming the chairmen who cried wolf.” The more they tried to get their investigation back on track, the more embarrassing their investigation became. It now appears the entire effort has run its course and come to an ignominious end. NBC News reported: The full, 291-page document is available online, but by any fair measure, it lands with a thud: The House Republicans’ report breaks no new ground and presents no credible evidence of wrongdoing. What’s more, Comer, Jordan, et al. released the findings while members are still on vacation and Capitol Hill is quiet, probably in the hopes of embarrassing the incumbent president ahead of his appearance at the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. Of course, in order to actually embarrass Biden, the report would have to include damaging information. This one does not. Making matters worse, it has no doubt occurred to the far-right committee chairmen that they’ve failed on multiple levels: House Republicans spent a year and a half desperately searching for evidence of crimes that were never committed, in the hopes of undermining a Democratic incumbent’s re-election plans that were ultimately put aside. In other words, GOP lawmakers failed to make a compelling case against a candidate who’s retiring anyway. So, what happens now? In theory, the impeachment report will be referred to House Republican leaders who will decide whether to hold an impeachment vote against the president. In practice, GOP leaders know they don’t have the votes to impeach the president without credible evidence of wrongdoing, so this entire misguided ordeal will likely fade into oblivion. As for Comer’s reputation, it appears unlikely to recover. The Kentuckian’s fellow Republicans have used words like “clueless” and “embarrassing” to describe his anti-Biden investigation, and the scope and scale of his fiasco won’t soon be forgotten."
Why Trump is ignoring Republican calls to focus on policy and issues,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 7:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ignoring-republican-calls-focus-policy-issues-rcna167151,"The more Donald Trump targets Kamala Harris with personal attacks, the more Republican officials try to convince the former president to try a more substantive and constructive course. So far, he has ignored the suggestions. But those hoping to steer him in a smarter direction keep trying anyway. The New York Times reported: Around the same time, Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” and delivered a similar line. “President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America, and if you have a policy debate for president, he wins,” the South Carolina Republican told host Kristen Welker. “Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.” The intraparty pitch is entirely straightforward: Trump has a substantive advantage, the argument goes, so if he can show some message discipline and stick to policy, his candidacy will benefit accordingly. And why, pray tell, is the former president ignoring this advice? There are a few reasons, actually. Trump doesn’t care about governing. In fact, he never has. (I wrote a book about this four years ago, exploring the problem in more detail.) There’s a reason the GOP candidate delivered a speech on economic policy last week that largely ignored economy policy: This guy just isn’t interested in talking about substantive issues, no matter how many people urge him to care. Trump doesn’t know how to talk about policy. Even if Trump could be convinced to pretend to care about governing, he’d quickly run into a related problem, which is even more serious: He can’t fake it well. Indeed, one of his signature issues is trade tariffs, and whenever he tries to talk about them, the Republican reminds the public that he still doesn’t understand his own idea at the most basic level. Trump almost certainly knows his ideas are unpopular. The former president has some goals he’s interested in pursuing, but they’re not exactly the sort of things that win over swing voters. Among Trump’s priorities are tax breaks for the wealthy, pardons for politically aligned criminals, abortion restrictions, and the creation of a temporary American “dictatorship.” Even if one were inclined to put aside the radioactive unpopularity of the Project 2025 agenda — written in large part by members of Trump’s own team — the GOP nominee’s own stated ideas are political losers, too. As Dan Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts, summarized last week, “This explains why Republicans in general and Trump in particular have become so flummoxed. The larger Republican party is keenly aware that Trump’s personal attacks on Harris will not redound to the GOP’s benefit. But neither can they talk about their actual policy platform because most of it is hideously unpopular.” No wonder Republicans seem so anxious about the ticket’s messaging."
Flailing Within the Margin of Error,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 7:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-flailing-margin-error-rcna167153,"Despite a party-wide effort urging Trump to pivot to policy, he just can’t seem to muster the discipline to talk about any issues. And for two former Senators who know the focus it takes to win a competitive race, it’s wild to watch. This week, former Senator Claire McCaskill’s Senate colleague Heidi Heitkamp joins her as guest-host. After weighing the latest musings from JD Vance’s audio vault, the two ‘post-menopausal grandmas’ remind him that older women are still able to vote. Claire also asks Heidi to give some perspective on the unique opportunity the Harris-Walz team has to reach rural voters. Then, Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman stops by for a deep dive into the latest Harris-Trump polling, how to understand the margin-of-error in a given sample, and how the down-ballot races are shaping up after the shift to the vice president’s candidacy.

Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Claire McCaskill: Hello, and welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Thursday morning on August 15th. I’m Claire McCaskill, and I’m here with a very special co-pilot today, my dearest bestest buddy, Heidi Heitkamp. She is the former Senator from North Dakota. She is also the Co-Founder and Chair of the One Country Project, co-host the Hot Dish podcast with her brother Joel, and has a very big and important job running the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. If you’re not familiar with the Institute of Politics, go look it up. They do amazing work, getting kids engaged that are attending the University of Chicago, and Heidi is doing great work there. All right, Heidi, what do you think? Heidi Heitkamp: I’m going to give a plug because we are bringing almost 300 students to the Democratic Convention, it’s a non-partisan event, to talk about getting out the youth vote and to do training on getting out the youth vote. And so, I’m very excited. We did it at the RNC and we’re doing it at the DNC. We think it’s so important at the Institute of Politics and important for our democracy to get people, at a minimum, young people, in the habit of voting and then building out opportunities to run for office. So, we’re very excited. Claire McCaskill: And I’m sure I’ll see you in Chicago next week, so. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes, we’re counting on it. Claire McCaskill: We’ll have a chance to hug. Okay, there’s 82 days to go, and Heidi and I know how intense the coming sprint can be for any candidate. You know who’s having a real hard time keeping focus and laying out his policy vision. Yes, that would be Donald J. Trump. We’ll assess how badly he’s flailing as everyone in his party is urging him to pivot to the issues and quit talking about Hannibal Lecter. And now that the polls have had a chance to bake in a bit with the shift to the Harris-Walz ticket, Dave Wasserman, the Senior Editor and Elections Analyst for “The Cook Political Report”, is going to lay out what the polls are cautiously indicating for the presidency and how the map is shaping up for the down-ballot races in the Senate, in the House, and even governorships. But first, Heidi, let’s talk some strategy. And, you know, we do a thing in this podcast, “If I were in the room.” So I think it’d be fun for us, Heidi, to do “If I were in the room” for the Trump campaign. I mean, I don’t even know what to say. I mean, this guy is so off his game. It is unbelievable to watch. You know, flailing is an understatement. He’s got everybody in his party panicked, and I’d love to hear your take on what do you think is going on and is it possible for him to correct course at this point? Heidi Heitkamp: Well, I think if you know Trump and I know Trump, we’ve spent a lot of time with him during the time that we were in the Senate, and he was the President. When things aren’t going well, he looks for someone to blame. And right now, he’s looking to blame his vice presidential candidate. And so, he’s spending way too much time talking about how that guy is the problem. He had a chance to pivot after the assassination attempt to a kinder, gentler, you know, “I’ve learned my lesson, don’t believe in political violence.” He went completely the other way. And so, is there a chance for him to pivot to a more normal tone in this campaign? And so far, he’s not only gone off the rails, so has his vice presidential candidate. And I think it’s an example, Claire, we always say this, that people think, “oh, that guy, he’s a senator, he’s ready for prime time.” He’s a senator for a hot minute, he’s never been in the spotlight, and he doesn’t think before he talks about, how is this going to be perceived by those all-important swing voters because he’s only spent his time talking to the radicals in his own party, genning them up and getting them engaged because that’s how you win primaries. And in red states, winning the primaries is everything, they don’t know how to talk to swing voters. And so, if I were in the room, I would show them data on what swing voters care about. I would say, “You need to be myopically focused on a policy message and not on grievance.” But I don’t think Trump is capable of walking away from grievance. That’s not Donald Trump. He’s right now looking for a scapegoat. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And by the way, I’m glad you’re not in the room with them because that’s way too good of advice. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Claire McCaskill: But the good news is, he would never take it, especially from a woman. So, although they’re saying they may bring back Kellyanne Conway, who knows? Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Claire McCaskill: By the way, he’s still playing golf almost every day, just so everybody knows. And that’s the other thing that’s really interesting here. The work ethic of the Harris-Walz campaign is going to start showing in ways that even swing voters and low-information voters and voters that don’t engage in the last 60 days are going to start noticing. You can’t do one campaign event a week when your opponent is doing seven or doing a bus tour, going to Pennsylvania all the way to the Chicago convention. These guys, Walz and Harris, are putting in 12-, 15-hour days every day, and besides that, you know, she’s happened to be Vice President, so she’s got work to do in that regard too. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, and think about this, because when people say, age doesn’t matter, this is exactly what we’re talking about. It’s a lot easier for people who are barely 60 to keep up that pace, to not make mental errors. And I think Donald Trump, I think that they’re afraid to send Donald Trump out on that kind of schedule because the more tired he gets, the more kind of grievance-driven he is. And so, Claire, if I’m in the room, I’m thinking, how do I balance the potential of him basically creating a two-day news cycle with some major gap compared to keeping him golfing. And I think that the real deal here is, had they picked maybe somebody else for vice president, they were expecting Trump to draft behind his vice presidential candidate, if you’re into biking, you know what I mean. Draft behind that vice presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate trips over their hurdles every step of the way, I mean, including this new thing with postmenopausal women, which we are, which by the way, why aren’t you taking care of your grandkids 24/7, Claire, and I have wondered, why aren’t I just go in there and taking care of my grandkids? We’re failing as grandmothers. Claire McCaskill: Yes, I noticed Hillary tweeted this morning something along the lines. First, it’s the child as cat ladies. Now, it’s postmenopausal women have no purpose in life other than raising grandchildren. Do these guys don’t realize that women have the vote? That’s my only question. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, and their swing voters, and their swing voters. Claire McCaskill: Oh, yes. Heidi Heitkamp: They have completely forgotten the game plan of six months ago. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And look at their three issues, Heidi. There are three issues. You know, first of all, if I were in the room with the Harris-Walz campaign, I would be continuing to try to drive crowd size because that’s his kryptonite. He cannot help himself on crowd size. So the more we have thousands and thousands of people turning out for her rallies, the better it is because it really bugs him. But there are three big issues, immigration, crime, and inflation. On all three of those, the Harris-Walz campaign can go on offense. They can go on offense on immigration because it’s way down. I mean, I read this morning, Abbott hasn’t even been able to send a bus to New York since last year. They are not seeing the border crossings that they saw earlier in the Biden administration, and they turned down a really effective border patrol-endorsed bill. Crime is down. The Justice Department chose a 15 percent drop in violent crime. More importantly, because they don’t believe the FBI or the Justice Department. The Major Cities Chiefs Association is showing that the murder rate in the 70 largest U.S. cities is down more than 8 percent since Trump left office. And then finally, inflation. I mean, we’re seeing inflation and the consumer price index, all of those things are moving the right direction. And even though it’s still too expensive to buy food and fuel, it is better than it was, and people are beginning to sense that. So there are three big issues. Harris and Walz have a lot of room to pivot and punch on their three issues. Heidi Heitkamp: And think about this, Claire, whenever they’re losing on the big issues, they pivot to cultural issues and that has historically been choice, and they are shocked. They are shocked that people are turning out to vote for a woman’s reproductive rights. They have played that issue in your state and my state for how many cycles and now, the worm has turned, and they have no ability to adapt. And I think it’s fascinating to watch them spin their tires. And, you know, we were talking about whether Kellyanne Conway is going to come back to the campaign. Guess what? She doesn’t have any magic answer to any of this either. She’s spinning on, “What do you do with this?” Claire McCaskill: Right. So, speaking of cultural issues, let’s segue to your area of expertise. The biggest divide in America, we talk about divides, partisan divides, but the biggest divide really in voter behavior at this point, especially over the last decade, is urban and rural. And you have spent a great deal of time trying to figure out why it is that rural voters are willing to vote against their own interests, economic interests at the altar of cultural issues. And I’d love you to spend a little time explaining how you think we can make progress with rural voters and whether or not you think Harris and Walz have a chance to make progress with rural voters in this election. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, first, let’s talk about that shift. I mean, when we talk about the ability to overcome a 22-point deficit. Barack Obama lost North Dakota by 22 points and now, he still won. Why is that? Because historically, the Republican Party hated the farm bill, and they would vote against it, and we could beat up on the farm bill. When they decided to embrace the farm bill, guess what? They started winning it because that economic issue now faded in comparison to the cultural issues of abortion or marriage equality, whatever it was, whatever was the dividing factor. So, now, we’ve got this mindset. Number one, I think we should be talking in the Democratic Party about how the Republicans have failed to deliver a farm bill, creating certainty, that they talk the talk, they never walk the walk. Democrats walk the walk, show the public what this administration has done for rural America, the kind of investment through the infrastructure bill, the commitment that we have, to doing a farm bill, the commitment we have to biofuels, which is huge in my part of the country, and we need to lead with that. But I think that one of the biggest reasons why we’ve lost rural America is because rural America doesn’t feel respected by Democrats. And I think if you watched any of the national news, you knew that I was out there, 190 percent for Tim Walz. And the reason why, not because I disliked or don’t appreciate, I don’t know Shapiro all that well, I certainly know Mark Kelly, love Mark Kelly, but I wanted someone that I could point to and say, “That guy who is us is going to be at the seat of power. He is going to be sitting in there talking about rural America every day.” And if you don’t think she respects rural America, why would she pick him? Claire McCaskill: Right. Heidi Heitkamp: She respects what we have to say. And so, I’ve said things like, “If you need your oil changed in your pickup, Tim Walz knows how to do that. If you need to go fishing, Tim Walz knows how to dock a boat then get you in the boat.” And so, I think that when you look at Tim Walz and you look at this ticket, we have a rural champion as her partner. And I think that’s a ticket we can sell. And the enthusiasm for Trump, I’m not saying they wouldn’t vote for him, but you are seeing a diminished enthusiasm for Donald Trump and rural America, and so I have reason for optimism, Claire. Claire McCaskill: I do too. And I do think what the president and vice president are doing today on healthcare costs, this negotiating for prescription drug costs, that’s going to save Medicare $6 billion next year and, you know, bring down the cost of some medicines as much as 79 percent for seniors. You and I both know that one of the crises of many crises in rural America, it’s healthcare. Heidi Heitkamp: Mm-hmm. Claire McCaskill: And the availability and the cost of healthcare is a big damn deal in rural America. And I do think they’re onto something here and they need to stay on it. Heidi Heitkamp: And if I can add, Claire, for all your listeners, understand this, every state that adopted Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has been able to save many more of their rural hospitals than states that haven’t. And so, I think it’s interesting that Trump’s not talking about repealing the ACA, Obamacare, because he knows it’s enormously popular in rural America where people can afford health insurance for the first time in a long time in their lives. Claire McCaskill: Yes, they’re not talking about healthcare at all. Well, we’re going to pause here. Up next, we’ve got Dave Wasserman of “Cook Political Report”. He joined us for a detailed view inside the latest polling and what down-ballot races look like after the shift to Vice President Harris. Back in a moment. Welcome back. My co-host, my buddy, my friend, Senator Heidi Heitkamp is still with me. And as we inch closer to November and the pivot to a Harris-Walz ticket, which has been amazing, we want to get a sense of what the polling is showing at this moment and how the new Democratic candidates have affected the down-ballot races. We’ve spent a lot of time talking about Harris-Walz in the last two weeks, not as much time talking about the House and the Senate. So, we’re going to try to cover that ground too. No one is better to do that with than Dave Wasserman. He is the Senior Editor and Elections Analyst for “The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter”, recognized as one of the nation’s top election forecasters. Dave leads the development of key election data visualizations and manages coverage of the House and redistricting developments. Welcome, Dave. Dave Wasserman: Hey, thanks so much. And might I add? It’s quite an honor to be with two of the winners of what we would consider to be the all-time greatest Senate races of the last century. Claire McCaskill: ’06. Heidi Heitkamp: Wow, wow. Claire McCaskill: It was quite a year. Heidi Heitkamp: Mine was ’12. Claire McCaskill: ’12.. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Claire McCaskill: Yours was ’12. Well, yes, and then that was kind of a special one for me. I was up to no good that it worked. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Dave Wasserman: Yes. You know, one of the projects we undertook this past year, “The Cook Report”, was digitizing all our archives going back 40 years to 1984. There are some great Senate race stories in there, but it’s hard to peg stronger overperformances in the modern era than what you, guys, posted, so hat’s off. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Heidi kicked ass too. It was great fun. Okay, this week, “The Cook Political Report” relaunched their national polling average now reflecting of the general election matchup between Harris and Trump. Before we get into where the horse race is right now based on polling, let’s take a second to try to consume what is important for our listeners to understand. We’re going to eat our veggies and talk about the margin of error. What is the margin of error? How does it work? And I think we have to keep reminding everyone that just because somebody’s up by four doesn’t mean they’re really up by four based on the margin of error. Dave Wasserman: Sure. Well, statistically, margin of error is the plus or minus that you have confidence a poll is accurate within a 95 percent confidence interval. What people have to understand is that even if Kamala Harris has a one- or two-point lead, that is within the margin of error given that the sample size produces a margin of error of around plus or minus four. But I think just as important as MOE is understanding that response rates have fallen through the floor. And so, polling is in the midst of a big question mark where people are just not answering the phone, and we haven’t yet fully moved on from traditional telephone-only polling even with large cell phone components, but we haven’t perfected the science of fully online polling either. We’re confident that these swing state polls that we put in the field do the best job we can of measuring what’s going on in the seven battleground states. We partnered with a Democratic firm, BSG, and a Republican firm, GS Strategy Group. And the difference between the polls that we put into the field in May and those that we just came out with is really with low engagement voters. Back in May, we were looking at Joe Biden ahead by four points, 49-45 among voters who were four out of four participating in the most recent four federal elections so voters who had shown up in ‘16, ‘18, ‘20 and ‘22. But he was trailing Trump by 10 points among everyone else, 41-51. And now, we’re seeing Kamala Harris, she has the same four-point lead among the high engagement voters, those who are paying the most attention and are most civicminded, 50 percent to 46 percent, but she’s narrowed the gap among the lower engagement, half of the electorate, to just three points. Trump has a 48- to 45-point lead in those seven battleground states. And what that tells me is that Kamala Harris is simply a much better pop culture candidate than Joe Biden. She has broken through on social media and channels like TikTok in a way that Joe Biden simply could not. And as a result, we’ve seen a collapse among RFK and third-party candidates, a shift in undecided and third parties to Kamala Harris’s column whereas Donald Trump’s number has pretty much remained the same. Claire McCaskill: So, I have a question. When people talk about polling and they think about predictability, one of the concerns that I have is that when you say, Trump’s ahead four, and then on election day, because he hasn’t enthusiastically built his base, he says, it’s rigged. And one of the problems that we have with polling is that it creates expectation. And now, we have, you know, the challenges of, this can’t be true, the election was rigged. How do we fix that, Dave? Dave Wasserman: You know, I think one of the hardest parts of building confidence in elections is the fact that it does take a long time to count the votes in these pivotal states when there aren’t laws passed that allow for pre-canvassing. And in 2020, it was, by design, a Trump and Republicans in key legislatures, including in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, to not adopt the same rules that states like Florida and Texas have that allow election officials to tally their ballots in advance of election day, so they’re ready to report at 7:00 or 8:00 P.M. when the poll is closed. People don’t understand why it takes so long to get election results, why it takes days, and it opens the door for bad actors to cast dispersions on election administration and to insinuate that something nefarious is going on. And we just saw in Pennsylvania that once again, the legislature in that state has blocked an effort to allow for pre-canvassing ballots. So, I think that’s another way in which Trump has laid the groundwork to question election results if Democrats win narrowly or even a little bit more than narrowly. Claire McCaskill: So what is the bottom-line at this point? Is she ahead in the battleground states and nationally? And if so, should we accurately call this a really, really close election at this point? Dave Wasserman: Look, for the first half of the year, things were so static that it almost felt like something seismic was bound to happen. And we’ve had about a year’s worth of seismic activity in just the last 40 days alone. We went from a campaign that Republicans would say, felt like “Weekend at Bernie’s” to “Silence of the Lambs” if you’re putting this in Netflix terminology to “Catwoman” featuring J.D. Vance to then “White Men Can’t Jump” featuring the roster of Democrats Kamala Harris was considering for V.P. And I don’t want to say we’re at “Miss Congeniality”, but we’re seeing the most remarkable turnaround in a candidate’s image in quite some time. Kamala Harris was at, in the FiveThirtyEight average, 37 fav, 53 unfav on July 20th. Today, she’s at 44 to 48, which qualifies as almost deity status given how anti-partisan, you know, skeptical of both parties’ nominees’ voters have generally been all year. Now, Trump has also seen a slight bump in favorability from 42-54 to 43-52, but Democrats need to be aware because this does not mean, given the polling, you know, that we’re seeing in these battleground states, which now might show Kamala Harris ahead very, very narrowly. This does not mean that Kamala Harris is suddenly the favorite in this race. Keep in mind that in 2020, Joe Biden led Donald Trump by an average of seven or eight points nationally heading into election day. And he had clear leads in all of the key battleground states and yet he won the national popular vote by four and a half points and the tipping-point state in the Electoral College, Wisconsin, by just 0.7. And if you add up Biden’s cumulative margin of victory in the three closest states, Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, he effectively won the election by 42,918 votes out of 159.6 million votes cast nationwide. And so, even while Trump was at a 41 percent approval rating, he was the incumbent, the spotlight was on him, he came within 43,000 votes of winning a second term. And it’s hard to imagine a better news environment for Kamala Harris than the one we’ve seen the past few weeks. Not only has she been able to reframe the race and reintroduce herself to voters in a way that makes her seem like the candidate of change rather than the vice president or incumbent administration. Obviously, Donald Trump has been rattled, he’s flailing, whether it is, you know, questioning her ethnicity or bashing Brian Kemp. These are politically insane things that he’s engaged in which, you know, by his standards, is reminiscent of elements of ‘16 and ‘20 but is certainly a change in tone from what we saw for the first half of the year when he was the favor. Heidi Heitkamp: So, let’s turn to what Claire and I think about quite a bit, which is, what’s going to happen with our former colleagues and maybe some new colleagues. Given this change, any chance for any new pickups for the Democratic Party and how are some of our incumbents doing like Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown? Dave Wasserman: Yes. And look, the down-ballot picture has not changed as drastically or nearly at all compared to what we’re seeing at the top of the ticket. And it’s amazing, you know, at the top of the ticket, what a difference it makes for Democrats when there are no longer questions about their nominees’ age. And I think, you know, we’re seeing Kamala Harris perform much more like a generic Democrat in this race against Trump. And the good news for Democrats, down-ballot is that we’re likely to see a much more conventional turnout on that side among young voters and among minority voters. We’re seeing better numbers obviously for Kamala Harris among Black and Hispanic voters. I would note, by the way, that in these polls, she’s making progress with those based Democratic groups, but she’s still not back to where Biden and Harris were in the final polls in 2020. And that is, you know, a reason for Democrats not to be overconfident right now in addition to the fact that in our poll, 53 percent said that she’s too liberal to govern the country effectively. And I think, you know, to sustain this momentum, she’ll need to be able to seize the middle. But how does this impact the Senate races? Well, for people like Jacky Rosen and Bob Casey and Tammy Baldwin, they were already running substantially ahead of Joe Biden. And in our most recent battleground state polls, there’s good news for Senate Democrats. Ruben Gallego, nine points ahead of Kari Lake in Arizona. We had Bob Casey running 13 points ahead of Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin by seven over Eric Hovde in Wisconsin. The real eyepopper was Jacky Rosen with a 54 to 36 lead in Nevada. Claire McCaskill: Wow. Dave Wasserman: Even though Harris is down three of the state now, of course, that is an outlier. And there are far more polls that show a closer race than that for Nevada Senate, but still, Jacky Rosen has had a massive spending advantage in the last couple months outspending Sam Brown, the Republican, something like 14 million to 1.7 million, and bashing him on abortion. The real problem for Democrats in the Senate is in these red states of Montana and Ohio. And the one place where I don’t think the switch at the top of the ticket is helpful for Democrats is Montana because, you know, a surge nationally in Black and Hispanic turnout really doesn’t show up in a state as white as Montana but also, Tester has realized that it’s probably unwise to endorse Kamala Harris given her liberal image, her California image in a state that is likely to vote for Trump by close to 20 points. And I think we are beginning to see some separation of that race from the others where Tim Sheehy appears to be opening up a slight lead. Now, I think Sherrod Brown is still very, very much in the fight. Claire McCaskill: He’s hanging in there. Dave Wasserman: Yes. And ahead -- Claire McCaskill: Yes. Dave Wasserman: -- in most surveys narrowly, not at 50 percent, but the math in Ohio is a bit different. You know, an increase in nonwhite turnout is going to benefit Sherrod Brown there. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Dave Wasserman: And also, Bernie Moreno had to get through a really competitive Republican primary where he had to take stances to the right on abortion that are out of step with where the majority of Ohio voters are. Claire McCaskill: Right. And just briefly, Dave, are Democrats engaging in the dream that we have every once in a while, that we could actually beat Ted Cruz and Rick Scott? Is there any chance in Texas or Florida? It feels like there is to me, especially with abortion on the ballot in Florida and how bad Texas has been on the subject of abortion, but what do you think? Any chance? Tell me there’s a chance, tell me there’s a chance. Dave Wasserman: You know, we don’t have a lot of great data from Florida and Texas in the past few weeks, but it’s hard to imagine these states being winnable for Senate Democrats if there’s no national investment in the presidential race in these states. And in Florida, you know, you look at the trendline here, it’s a state where Trump expanded his margin between 2016 and 2020. And obviously, Ron DeSantis blew the doors off in 2022 when Democrats just stopped believing they could win. And I think that has corrosive effects when it comes to the Democratic base in the state, not only are you seeing states kind of attract likeminded people based on the governance and abortion policies quite frankly of the states, which I think is causing fewer democratic voters to move into Florida, probably prompting some to move out of Florida, but also that lack of belief and lack of money into Florida and Texas makes it very hard for Collin Allred and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell even if those Republican incumbents have unique liability. So they’re still in our likely Republican column. Claire McCaskill: Well, I’m going to just tell everybody right now, I believe it can happen. Next up, how the map is looking for the control of the House, this is where Dave’s a real expert back with Senator Heidi Heitkamp and Dave Wasserman of “Cook Political Report” in a moment. Welcome back. Former North Dakota Senator extraordinaire Heidi Heitkamp, and I have been speaking with Dave Wasserman, Senior Editor and Elections Analyst for “The Cook Political Report”. Dave and Heidi, let’s head to the House. What’s it look like over there, Dave? We all thought that it was a sure thing. We’d have a House pickup of a majority for Democrats before the wheels fell off the Biden campaign and then we all got very nervous. Chief worry among those were Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi. Should they feel a little more comfortable now? Dave Wasserman: You know, I don’t think that the House picture has changed all that much from where it was in, say, May. Now, had Joe Biden remained the Democratic nominee and there was a fatalism that set in among Democrats then I think you would’ve had a problem that really hurt Democrat’s ability to win the House. But the dynamic in the House has been a little bit more favorable to Democrats than in the Senate, actually, a lot more favorable than the Senate for a couple of reasons. Number one, they’re fighting on more favorable terrain than in the Senate. You’re not talking about defending Montana and Ohio as much because there are 16 Republicans sitting in Biden districts up for re-election and five Democrats sitting in Trump districts, and Democrats only need to pick up four seats on that to get to 218. And most of those vulnerable Republicans are in California and New York. And most of those Democrats in Trump districts are pretty strong incumbents, people like Jared Golden and Mary Peltola and Marcy Kaptur. And then the second reason is you have seen, and I think this is validated by the Senate battleground polls that we just came out of field with. Voters, to the extent they believe Donald Trump has a good chance of winning the White House, they want to put a check on him. And Democrats have benefited from the desire of voters to vote for a Democrat to prevent Trump from going too far in his direction. We saw, I think, the opposite dynamic in ‘16 and ‘20, when the polls showed that Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden were going to win by a mile. And you had a number of suburban independence, particularly women who decided, well, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden’s going to win, you know, I’m not voting for Donald Trump, but I’m going to vote for a more conventional Republican down-ballot who is not Donald Trump, who will prevent Democrats from going too far and left. And I think we’re seeing that dynamic show up in House polls where, you know, Democratic incumbents in particular have been running ahead of Joe Biden all year long. Now, they’re still running ahead of the top of the ticket, but Kamala Harris has come closer in many districts to where those House Democrats already work. And then the third part is that House Republicans have been a mess. It took them 15 votes to elect a speaker. It took only eight House Republicans to oust that speaker last October. And Democrats picked up George Santos’s seat in New York, and now, they are within four seats, and they have a financial advantage in most of these toss-up contests. The reason I still think it’s going to be tough for Democrats to get over the top in the House is some of these open seats. Republicans don’t really have any vulnerable open seats. Democrats have two toss-up open seats in Michigan where Dan Kildee is retiring and where Elissa Slotkin is running for Senate. And then also in Virginia and California, there are a few that Democrats need to defend. So, the House is going to be really close. Heidi Heitkamp: I want to make this point, Dave, because I think when you look at 2020, because of COVID, Democrats didn’t run a very aggressive field game. And I think that’s why you saw the polling not match the outcome in a lot of the swing states. Now, there’s been huge amounts of investment in field, especially in those swing states when we talk about Michigan. So how does the Democrat turnout machine that I think will get cranked up after the convention, how will that affect these House races? Dave Wasserman: Well, it’s a good question, particularly in those states where you have overlap. So, you know, there are two toss-ups each in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona. And, you know, those seats are going to depend a lot on the party’s ground games. And the Republicans have taken a big risk by outsourcing Trump’s ground effort to super PACS, including Turning Point USA, whereas Democrats have a well-funded and more conventional coordinated campaign to knock on doors in most of these places. And that stands to benefit Democrats running in these close seats. But keep in mind that most of these toss-up races are going to be in California and New York. And we have 22 toss-ups out of 435 seats. If you add up all the seats that at least lean towards Democrats, there are 203 seats in our ratings. If you add up all the seats that at least lean towards Republicans, there are 210. These 22 toss-ups will come down to people like Mike Garcia, a Republican in Northern L.A. County, or Mike Lawler, a Republican in Westchester County, outside of New York. And they are talented Republicans who are fending off well-funded Democratic challengers. And, you know, one thing we noticed is that incumbents on both sides of the aisle are doing quite well, but Democrats only need to knock off a handful of Republicans to get to 218. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And I think it’s important on this ground game. We’ve tried to cover this in previous episodes. You know, the ground game is really where campaigns identify voters that are low frequency, that are not as engaged as your likely voters, your four-out-of- fours that you referred to earlier, Dave, and they find these folks and then they actually have to do this a lot with volunteers, a lot with volunteers. You cannot pay enough people to knock on the doors, identify the voter and then do the follow-up you have to do to push them towards the polls. And the interesting thing is they basically shut down their ground operation when Lara Trump took over the RNC when she and Sevidas moved in there. And they put all those resources into this bullshit voter intimidation, voter suppression, let’s see if we can’t figure out a way to not certify elections. They put all the resources there and then outsourced the traditional stuff. Now, I don’t know, but I don’t know very many volunteers that show up for a bunch of paid people with some organization they’ve never heard from, they don’t know about. I can’t envision how these paid PACs, how these super PACs are going to get the bodies on the ground that you need to do this effectively. I know how many we had to have in ‘18. We knocked on more doors than any other Senate campaign in the country. We had thousands of volunteers. And I can’t imagine they’re getting that many volunteers for their ground game. Heidi Heitkamp: So, Claire, let’s add to that, since Kamala has joined the race, the amount of volunteers has exploded. So, we know that that’s happening, more people wanting to be engaged. Plus, I want to tell a story about Iowa because I think it illustrates what you’re talking about. When I was in Iowa during the Republican caucuses, I heard story after story because Nikki Haley outsourced her ground game to the Koch operation, right? And there were people going door-to-door for Nikki Haley that when they were challenged at the door, “I’m voting for Trump,” the people at the door said, “So am I, I’m just getting paid to knock this door.” And so, here is exactly the example. When you don’t have believers knocking the door, you have paid people just knocking the door, that’s not a formula for success. You need true believers who are going to be respectful but also tell the story. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And before we leave, Dave, I want to make sure we get in a couple of minutes on the governor’s races because we’ve now done presidential, we’ve done the Senate, we’ve done the House. Tell me what you’re seeing in the governor’s races. Any chances for pickups for the Democrats in the governor’s races? Dave Wasserman: Well, the only real chance for a pickup would be New Hampshire. And keep in mind, there are only 10 governor’s races on the ballot this year. Now, Democrats are in a decent position to hold on to North Carolina because, keep in mind, Roy Cooper is leaving, Josh Stein has opened up a lead, according to our latest poll against Mark Robinson, who has -- Claire McCaskill: Is a nut. Dave Wasserman: -- said a variety of things that, you know, Democrats can frame as, you know, kind of being from another planet with regard to his views on women and abortion. And so, Josh Stein has basically just flooded the airwaves with Mark Robinson in his own words. And that has transferred this race from basically a tie back in May to, in our latest poll, 48-40 lead for Stein. So, you know, that seat looks better for Democrats than it did. But most of the governor’s races we’re watching are in safe state. Now, I’ll be very curious to see what these longshot Democrats are able to put together in Indiana and Missouri, two states where you have had some Republican infighting that, you know, could at least make those contests more interesting. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And we have abortion on the ballot too in Missouri. I’m not giving up on Crystal Quade, who is the Democratic nominee for governor, and I’m certainly not giving up on Lucas Kunce, who is running against a guy that I think people know by the name of Josh Hawley, the He-Man, the manly man, the guy who has the nerve to write a book about manhood when he ran through the hallways of the Capitol, like a scared little puppy, when the folks invaded. Can you tell I really like this guy? I try not to trash him too often because it’s not good for my mental health, but you know. Heidi Heitkamp: Yes. Well, I call him the hand razor. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Heidi Heitkamp: You know, yay insurrection, the yay insurrection guy. And so, I think, you know, even though abortion’s not on the ballot in North Carolina, it’s on the ballot in North Carolina because of their gubernatorial candidate. And I think for your listeners, Claire, it’s really important that you understand that these races are not separable in terms of turnout. You could have somebody who turned out for the governor. We haven’t seen split ticket voting in a long, long time, certainly as it relates to the president and the Senate. What I’m watching is, are we going to see again split ticket voting come back to the American population, American democracy, which I think would be a good thing? That’s me from a red state. As a Democrat, I always relied on split ticket voting. It went away for at least the last 10 years. It might be coming back this cycle. Claire McCaskill: The only place that we really saw a significant split ticket in voting in the last Senate cycle was, in fact, Montana and Ohio and West Virginia. Dave Wasserman: Right. And we are seeing a comeback in split ticket voting in some of the Senate polls this cycle, and that’s really a testament to, I think, how much voters were down on Biden for most of the cycle, but we’re not ready to embrace Republicans and wanted balance. And I think we’re still seeing that to some extent, the question is whether Democrats can sustain it all the way to November. Claire McCaskill: All right. Well, this has been great. Really appreciate you, Dave. Thank you for your time. Thank you for educating us about the polling and all of these places. And we’ll look forward to checking in with you because, who knows? This has been quite a rollercoaster ride. I’m not sure we’ve seen the last incline or the last dip. There may be others in the future. There usually is in October. We’ll see how the debates turn out. But it’s been great to have you, we really appreciate you. Dave Wasserman: Thanks for having me. Claire McCaskill: Thanks for joining us for today’s installment of “How to Win 2024” and a huge thanks. I hope you can feel it in my voice how much I love this woman. I can get choked up, I love her so much. A big thank you to the best thing to ever come out of North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp. Heidi Heitkamp: Well, listen to one of my favorite postmenopausal grandmas in the whole wide world. I love you to death and I love your whole family. You know, Claire, it’s always so much fun when you and I are together. Claire McCaskill: Yes, let’s do it again. Heidi Heitkamp: Absolutely.

Trump taps two of his adult kids for presidential transition team,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 6:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-two-adult-kids-presidential-transition-team-rcna167129,"When Donald Trump was president, he relied on his daughter and son-in-law in the West Wing. When Trump needed a new leadership team at the Republican National Committee, he rewarded his daughter-in-law with a top post. And when it came time for Trump to put together a post-election transition team, the former president once again kept matters within the family. The New Republic noted that the GOP candidate unveiled a five-member transition team — and two of his sons are on it. It’s worth emphasizing that in modern presidential elections, both major-party nominees choose transition teams long before Election Day so that they don’t have to start from scratch in November. This isn’t a situation in which members of Team Trump are simply assuming they’re going to win; Team Harris is making similar plans. Indeed, part of what makes these developments notable isn’t that they’re too early, but rather, that they’re surprisingly late. As a New York Times report explained, “As a matter of timing, it came months after a typical presidential campaign starts working on contingency planning to ensure a smooth transition should its candidate win the election.” In 2016, for example, Trump’s operation announced a transition team in May. This year, for reasons unknown, the Republican campaign waited until mid-August. What’s more, eight years ago, Team Trump focused on officials with governing experience to oversee the transition effort, tapping then-Gov. Chris Christie and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. In 2024, the transition team will feature McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive who led the Small Business Administration during Trump’s term; Lutnick, a wealthy donor; two of Trump’s sons; and the former president’s current running mate. But just as notable is the fact that the transition team is slated to play a prominent role in staffing the prospective administration, and as The New Republic’s report added, this is a subject of great interest to the former president’s oldest son. “I don’t want to pick a single person for a position of power. All I want to do is block the guys that would be a disaster,” Trump Jr. told Axios in July. “I want to block the liars. I want to block the guys that are, you know, pretending they’re with you.” The Times’ report added that Team Trump does not intend to use “the office space and computers that the federal government makes available for transitions,” and officials from the campaign would not explain why."
Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat's Olympic medal bid is rejected,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 15, 2024, 6:25 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 19, 2024, 6:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/india-wrestler-vinesh-phogat-medal-rejected-rcna166708,"UPDATE (Aug. 19, 2024, 9:21 a.m. ET): The Court of Arbitration for Sport has now published its decision explaining the denial of Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat’s application for a shared silver medal after she did not make the required weight ahead of the finals. The arbitrator’s decision cited the strict weight rules for Olympic competition. Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat’s legal bid for an Olympic silver medal has been rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The star athlete, known for her activism against sexual harassment, was set to compete for a gold medal last week, but she was disqualified after she weighed in at just over the required 50-kilogram limit ahead of that match.   The court’s media release announcing the dismissal of Phogat’s application didn’t explain its reasoning, saying that the decision would be forthcoming on the Switzerland-based tribunal’s website.  But the outcome is unsurprising because, as I previously noted, the wrestling rules state that if an athlete doesn’t attend or fails a weigh-in, then they’re eliminated from the competition “and ranked last, without rank.” Nonetheless, Phogat applied to the tribunal for a (shared) silver medal. There are separate weigh-ins for each day of competition, so Phogat had made the weight cut-off in her previous matches leading up to the finals. She reportedly only missed the weight last Wednesday by 100 grams — about a fifth of a pound. She had been set to go for gold against U.S. wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt, who won the final match over Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Phogat beat in the semifinal the day before and who took Phogat’s place against Hildebrandt.

VFW slams Trump’s ‘asinine’ rhetoric about the Medal of Honor,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 5:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vfw-slams-trumps-asinine-rhetoric-medal-honor-rcna167119,"The Veterans of Foreign Wars has long positioned itself as a nonpartisan organization that has nothing to do with electoral politics. Plenty of groups run campaign ads, issue endorsements, and create super PACs, but the VFW isn’t one of them. With this in mind, it becomes all the more notable when the organization publicly criticizes a presidential candidate in an election year. In 2020, for example, an Iranian missile strike left several dozen U.S. troops with traumatic brain injuries. Trump dismissed the importance of the injuries — he called them little more than “headaches” — prompting the Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask him to apologize for minimizing what had happened to the troops. Trump ignored the request. Four years later, the GOP candidate insulted veterans again, prompting another VFW response. The New York Times reported: If you missed it, it was late last week when Trump spoke at an event on antisemitism at his Bedminster golf club and was introduced by Miriam Adelson, who plays a prominent role in GOP politics. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, the former president, unprompted, reflected on the fact that he gave Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, as part of an apparent gesture to thank the late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “That’s the highest award you can get as a civilian. It’s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version,” Trump said, referring to the Medal of Honor military award. “It’s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump added. “She gets it and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal, but she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she got it for — and that’s through committees and everything else.” These unscripted and wildly unnecessary comments are what prompted the angry response from the VFW, among many others. For his part, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley responded to the controversy by telling NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt, “Well, look, there is nobody who supports the military, our veterans’ communities, and all of the military families more than President Trump.” I won’t pretend to know whether the RNC chair genuinely believes what he said, but the fact of the matter is that pretty much everyone supports the military, our veterans’ communities, and all of the military families more than Trump. We are, after all, talking about a Republican who has disparaged wounded veterans, condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers” and “losers,” disparaged American servicemen and women who are captured during combat, feuded with Gold Star families, and downplayed the importance of troops with traumatic brain injuries. What’s more, as a candidate, Trump liked to say he “felt” like he had served in the military because his parents sent him to a military-themed boarding school as a teenager. He went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military,” which was a precursor to Trump pointing to bone spurs as part of an apparent effort to dodge the draft. In other words, it’s not as if this guy has a reservoir of credibility on veterans’ issues he can rely on after his latest nonsensical comments."
Latest 2024 polls lead Trump campaign to concoct weird theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/latest-2024-polls-lead-trump-campaign-concoct-weird-theories-rcna167113,"For much of the year, Donald Trump had reason to be pleased with national and battleground state polling. Four years ago, surveys showed the Republican struggling badly ahead of his eventual defeat. In 2024, however, the data showed the former president consistently ahead. That is, until it didn’t. After incumbent President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign and Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy gave Democrats a much-needed boost, public opinion research showed Trump’s advantage start to evaporate — both in head-to-head matchups and on key issues. The GOP candidate and his political operation haven’t exactly handled the shift in a healthy way. Two weeks ago, for example, Team Trump embraced a “skewed polls” message reminiscent of 2012. On his social media platform, the former president also tweaked his messaging, abandoning missives about polls, and instead touting what he described as “real” polls that told him what he wanted to hear. But it was his running mate, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who took matters in a deeply weird direction. HuffPost reported: “Consistently, what you’ve seen in 2016 and 2020 is that the media uses fake polls to drive down Republican turnout and to create dissension and conflict with Republican voters,” the senator said. Vance added, “If you talk to insiders in the Kamala Harris campaign, they are very worried about where they are.” For now, let’s not dwell on the dubious idea that Trump’s running mate has special insights into the perspectives of Harris campaign staffers — who probably aren’t sharing private thoughts with the far-right senator. Let’s instead consider just how bizarre Vance’s conspiracy theory is. To hear Vance tell it, major independent news organizations conspired — more than once — to release false polling data, as part of an elaborate plot to discourage Republican voters. As far as the Ohioan is concerned, this is grounds for skepticism about 2024 polling. In Grown-Up Land, of course, major independent news organizations have never conspired to distribute fraudulent survey data, and the fact that Vance peddled such a line to a national television audience is a reminder of just how ridiculous his messaging has become. I did, however, have a follow-up question for the senator: If media outlets release “fake” polling data to manipulate Republican voters, why did the polls show Trump ahead for months? From Vance’s perspective, did news organizations temporarily forget, only to suddenly remember the plot?"
Democrats are united and focused — for a change,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-united-dnc-election-new-energy-harris-walz-rcna166638,"A month ago, Democrats weren’t just “in disarray,” as the perennial meme beloved by conservatives goes. They were in downright despair.  President Joe Biden was insisting he would stay on the presidential ticket unless the Almighty himself told him to step down. Since the Almighty had not made many direct interventions in human affairs since that one chat with Moses on Mount Sinai a few years back, it seemed like the Democrats were stuck with a candidate most Americans thought was too old to run again. Then came the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, from which he emerged with his fist held high in the air, surrounded by Secret Service agents as blood streamed from his ear. That image became instantly iconic, a show of defiance against a would-be assassin. A columnist for The Guardian had the temerity to put into words what many of us were thinking: “Did Donald Trump just win the election?” Yes, went the prevailing answer. In the days after the attempt on Trump’s life, in texts exchanged with Democratic operatives on Capitol Hill and staffers in the Biden administration, I sensed only unmitigated despair. Everyone was glad that Trump had emerged unscathed, but they also recognized how much that one moment had seemingly shifted the entire political landscape. “The presidential contest ended last night,” a Democratic strategist told NBC News. Morale was plunging. Not just electoral morale, mind you, but the morale of people who feared that their work — on green energy, racial equity, Israel-Palestine — was going to be undone by Trump, just as much of Barack Obama’s legacy had partly been after the 2016 election. The shock of a Trump victory in 2016 had come at the very last moment, as the stunning results from Wisconsin and Michigan came in. But as Democrats realized the ship was sinking in July 2024, many became resigned to watching a three-month slow-moving defeat — as Trump coasted to perhaps the easiest presidential victory since Ronald Reagan clobbered Walter Mondale in 1984. Now it is August, the Democratic National Convention is about to commence in Chicago, and the reversal of fortunes since late July could not be more astonishing. As a dispassionate observer who does not vote, I’ve nevertheless watched every Democrat I know wake up as if from a long, frustrating sleep into a sunny reality they did not know could exist. Not since the earliest days of the Obama phenomenon has there been this much energy from mainstream Democrats. We have much to learn about Vice President Kamala Harris, but there is no doubt she has energized the entire party in just a matter of weeks, despite having been a known and not especially well-liked political entity for the last four years. It’s like she fell out of a coconut tree, you might say, to suddenly discover that she has been unburdened by what has been (I’ll stop now). “She’s got an intensity advantage, and I haven’t seen anything like this happen in 30 days in my lifetime,” the Republican pollster Frank Luntz recently said on CNBC. That intensity took a few steps to build. First came the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, and the selection of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as Trump’s running mate. I maintained from the start that he was a bad choice born of arrogance, pushed by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, fringe nationalists and online edgelords (in other words, Peter Thiel). Everything since then has borne out that opinion, and then some. Vance is a serious drag on the Republican ticket. Don’t be surprised if Trump replaces Vance with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whom he should have picked in the first place. Then, of course, came The Swap. Here, I made an incorrect prediction: that Harris would not be seen as a legitimate choice to replace Biden unless she emerged from something resembling a primary. I was wrong. With astonishing speed, Harris got the entire Democratic establishment to back her as Biden’s successor. Third, there was Tim Walz. I found the far-left campaign against Josh Shapiro, the popular and moderate Pennsylvania governor, to be unseemly and frankly laced with antisemitism. At the same time, I am sure that his Minnesota counterpart is the better choice for this moment. Walz offers a better contrast to Harris herself, and his folksy Midwestern charm has been a tonic for our bitter political climate. Plus, his labeling Trump and, in particular, Vance as “weird” in an MSNBC interview may turn out to be the most inspired political branding of the season. He has only extended the enthusiasm for Harris while Vance has continued to drag on Trump. And then there’s Trump himself, who has struggled to define his new opponent while resorting to some of his worst impulses, attacking her racial identity at a summit of Black journalists, then going after Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, the Republican leader of a key state. “Trump Is Looking Like a Loser Again,” went the headline of a column by Gerard Baker of The Wall Street Journal, a conservative who likes Harris as much as I like the Boston Red Sox. In no way would I count out Trump — but it’s simply undeniable that his chances of victory are trending downward. He is doing nothing to help his own chances. And expect to see protests by activists in Chicago. Although some pro-Palestinian activists have said they are willing to give Harris a chance, she is unlikely to budge from her commitment to Israel, which could lead to a damaging internecine spat. Her centrist views on the economy could also frustrate a left that, like the right, is bound to be disappointed by the fact that Harris is not a to-the-barricades progressive. Please don’t read any of this as cheerleading. It is simply true that the Democrats have enjoyed a reversal of fortunes unlike anything I’ve seen in American politics. It may not last, but it is real."
Why Beyoncé's 'Freedom' is the perfect campaign song for Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/beyonce-kamala-harris-freedom-rcna166745,"In the voice-over for Vice President Kamala Harris’ first campaign ad as a 2024 presidential candidate, we heard her lay out her objectives for America — ­ranging from reducing gun violence, poverty and health care costs to codifying reproductive rights — and we see a racially diverse mix of enthusiastic voters, multigenerational families, union workers, the LGBTQ+ community, Harris on the campaign trail and headlines about Donald Trump’s conviction in Manhattan. We also heard a familiar song playing. That song is Beyoncé’s 2016 anthem “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar, which Beyoncé permitted Harris to use as her walk-out song during her first public appearance as a presidential candidate. It’s also the official campaign (and theme) song of Harris’ 2024 presidential bid. With its liberating tone, the song, which was used as a battle cry for many Black Lives Matter demonstrations following the 2020 death of George Floyd, now evokes the aspirational promise of the Democratic Party. Alongside the pounding, warlike drums and fiery rock pulse, Beyoncé’s voice roars, “I’ma keep running ’cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.”Great campaign songs often toe a fine line between galvanizing a political party’s base and aligning with its supporters’ interests and pressing concerns. Great campaign songs are also effective at capturing the vision and policies of the presidential candidates. No one should be surprised that Beyoncé let Harris use “Freedom.” From day one, she has been intentional about using her artistry to advocate for women’s empowerment, sisterhood, community, Black culture and freedom. As a member of Destiny’s Child, her quicksilver and resolute vocals adorned such chart-toppers as “Bills, Bills, Bills,” “Independent Women, Pt. 1” and “Survivor,” articulating the ideals of modern Black women through an infectious, contemporary mix of R&B, pop and hip-hop grooves.On introspective, experimental full-length albums such as 2013’s world-stopping “Beyoncé,” 2016’s culture-defining song cycle “Lemonade,” and her celebratory 2022 love letter to LGBTQ+ culture’s roots in dance music, “Renaissance,” Beyoncé refined her sound and messages to reflect the social zeitgeist as well as her evolution as a woman and cultural observer. Using “Freedom” to amp up excitement for campaign is a sign that Harris understands Beyoncé’s influence on the culture and that her campaign recognizes Beyoncé as a generational icon with a wide appeal among younger demographics. Harris has long devoted her time to addressing the issues facing younger generations, especially younger women. From implementing solutions to help millions curb their crippling student loan debt to stressing the importance of upholding the protections of Roe v. Wade, she is campaigning on a promise to defend the interests and protect the rights and well-being of young people. She has to know what’s at stake if young people aren’t motivated to vote.According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the turnout of young voters ages 18 to 29 saw a significant boost in the 2020 election, rising almost 12 percentage points from 2016. In 2020, 55% of registered voters in this age group cast their ballots, marking the largest turnout in this demographic since 1972. Even so, the fact remains that older voters turn out at the highest rates. In the 2020 election, 74% of voters ages 65 and older participated. There’s been an ongoing debate over whether Harris can effectively win over Gen-Z and younger millennial voters. Megan Thee Stallion performed at her large rally in Atlanta, and celebrities including Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Olivia Rodrigo, Barbra Streisand and Lizzo have expressed support for either Harris or her policies. Some have argued that this embrace of memes, celebrity endorsements and Gen-Z jargon is not enough. By itself, it isn’t. At least it shouldn’t be. Harris still needs to earn the votes of this country’s youngest voters. But she can’t do that without grabbing their attention, and relying on celebrities who support her is not a bad way of doing that.Harris is also fortunate to be the kind candidate and to have the kind of platform that the world’s best musicians want to be associated with. Add to that many artists’ distaste for her opponent. A long list of musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Adele have objected to Trump using their work to promote his campaign. When the former president’s campaign played a video of Celine Dion performing “My Heart Will Go On” at a rally in Montana this month, her team responded, “In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use… And really, THAT song?” Last week, Isaac Hayes Enterprises (the estate of the late musician) announced that it is suing Trump and his campaign for “134 counts [of] copyright infringement for the unauthorized use of the song ‘Hold On I’m Coming’ at campaign rallies from 2022-2024.” Hayes co-wrote the song, which was most famously performed by Sam & Dave.(The Associated Press reports that in 2022, David Porter, another co-writer, wrote “Hell to the NO!” after learning that Trump had used “Hold On, I’m Coming” at an NRA rally. Sam Moore (one half of Sam & Dave) performed “America the Beautiful” at a pre-inauguration concert Trump held in 2017.) But Beyoncé has given Harris the freedom to use one of her most powerful songs. “Freedom, freedom, where are you? / ‘Cause I need freedom, too,” Beyoncé sings. In playing that song, Harris is signaling why her supporters must vote."
This year's DNC will be the opposite of 1968 thanks to a lesson learned the hard way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-walz-dnc-1968-convention-lesson-rcna166958,"1968 was one of the worst years in American history. In the middle of that year was the worst Democratic National Convention in history. In Chicago. When the Democrats convene in the same place this month, their convention will be the opposite of 1968 thanks to the lesson learned the hard way then: Never again.  1968 was a year of death. The death of soldiers. The death of leaders. The death of dreams. 1968 was the deadliest year of the Vietnam War for American soldiers and the families who lost them. 16,899 American soldiers were killed in Vietnam that year, more than double the number of Americans killed in all wars since then. I went to my first military funeral in 1968 and watched a general cry burying his son, my cousin Johnny, a recent West Point graduate who led troops in combat for four months before winning the Silver Star on the day he was killed in action. Everyone knew someone who lost a loved one in Vietnam. We were living in a national death gloom on a scale unknown since then, including the fear of death in the millions of young men who were at or, in my case, approaching the age of eligibility for the draft — with no end of the war in sight. Thousands of those young men with draft cards in their wallets, alongside some of their girlfriends and sisters and peace advocates of all ages, went to Chicago in 1968 to demand an end to the Vietnam War. For them, the stakes at the convention were nothing less than life and death. By the time the anti-war protesters arrived at the convention, one of their candidates was dead. Heroes were hard to come by then, but the peace movement had a few. America’s most inspirational public speaker, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., broke with the president who signed the Civil Rights Act and eloquently opposed Lyndon Johnson’s war. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Sen. Robert Kennedy ran against the war in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries five years after the assassination of his older brother, President John F. Kennedy. On June 5, 1968, immediately after delivering his California primary victory speech, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. So ended the dream of another Kennedy presidency. The peace candidate left standing at the convention was the first candidate with the audacity to challenge the incumbent president in primaries, Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who shocked American politics with a strong showing in the New Hampshire primary against Johnson. Only 12 states had primaries in 1968, so the nomination had to be won at the convention. McCarthy won the most states and the most votes which earned him nothing at the convention. Every night of the convention was increasingly chaotic and violent outside the hall and inside the hall. Protesters were being beaten in the streets by what an investigative commission would later call a “police riot.” Chicago’s Mayor Richard Daley was disgracing himself inside the hall by using his army of convention floor operatives to try to silence, sometimes with fists, any dissent about delivering the nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a supporter of LBJ’s war, who didn’t run in a single primary. CBS’s Dan Rather was shoved to the floor as startled TV viewers watched. Walter Cronkite told the country, “I think we’ve got a bunch of thugs here, if I may be permitted to say so.” The next night, CBS reporter Mike Wallace took a punch to the jaw on the convention floor. When Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, a polished speaker and former Kennedy cabinet member, departed from his prepared remarks at the podium to condemn the “Gestapo tactics” of the Chicago police, we could all read Mayor Daley’s lips on TV shouting, “F--- you, you Jew son of a b----!” The networks turned to lip readers to confirm for us that the mayor said exactly what we thought he said. That night the Chicago police used so much tear gas Humphrey could smell it through the air vents of his hotel suite. The networks cut from live riot coverage to the moment on the convention floor when Humphrey won the nomination at 11:47 p.m. in what became the least important news of the night. So ended the dream of voters being able to stop the war on Election Day with an anti-war candidate. Richard Nixon watched the Democratic convention on TV knowing that no moment at the Republican convention would help him win the presidency more than every moment at the Democratic convention. Nixon, never a popular politician, won in November by less than one percent of the vote. The Democrats changed their rules so that the nomination would be awarded by voters in presidential primaries and they never had a contested convention again. This year, as concerns mounted about President Joe Biden’s position at the top of the ticket, suggestions popped up everywhere for how to find a new nominee if Biden stepped down. Virtually every suggestion included an open convention where, after the candidates campaigned against each other politely on talk shows or something such, the nomination would be decided by a dramatic vote of the delegates with the promise that it would be exciting TV. But every time I came upon the word “exciting” I saw the word “chaos” instead. Betting on reporters who’ve never seen an open convention to describe it as exciting instead of chaos seemed naïve. What if it took as many ballots to get a nominee as it now takes to get a speaker of the House? How weakened would the eventual nominee be by all the angry speeches against them? There wouldn’t have to be violence inside or outside the hall for today’s reporters to quickly reach for the word chaos. Professional Democrats, including convention delegates, can still feel the scar tissue of the 1968 Chicago convention. And they delivered a different outcome this year when, once again, the president dropped out of the race and tried to hand the nomination to his vice president: instant unity, no arguments, no punches thrown. Lesson learned.  "
JD Vance isn’t helping Trump’s ticket. Removing him would be even worse.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 18, 2024, 9:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-isnt-helping-trumps-ticket-removing-even-worse-rcna167006,"Experts often debate about the best approach to vice presidential selection: Try to balance out the presidential candidate’s characteristics, experience, and regional background? Or focus on finding a credible governing partner? But there’s almost implicit agreement on one principle: The vice presidential candidate should not harm the ticket. And it seems a lot easier for a VP pick to bring liability — from lack of proper vetting for scandals to lack of preparation of serve as president or lackluster campaign skills — than to really help the ticket. So far, Donald Trump seems like he may have failed that test with the selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, whose ratings have reportedly officially dipped to the lowest for any running mate in modern history. Vance was the choice of a confident candidate, looking at strong re-election odds after President Joe Biden’s notoriously poor performance during the June 27 debate and some positive media coverage after a July 13 assassination attempt. The driving factors behind Vance’s selection seem to be his recently honed Trumpist credentials, especially his statement about how he would have acted differently from Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice president, on Jan. 6, 2021. But the race has changed since then. Biden is no longer at the top of the Democratic ticket, for one. And Vance looks especially troubling compared to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom more Americans view favorably than unfavorably. Vance hasn’t been able — or hasn’t appeared to try very hard — to distance himself from controversial past statements about gender, abortion and people without children. As a result, there’s been some speculation about Trump replacing him. It feels important to say that the odds of that happening are very slim. But if it were to happen, how would this work exactly? From the standpoint of the formal rules of the Republican Party, it’s fairly straightforward. The rules lay out a similar process for replacing the presidential and vice presidential candidates after the convention; the most likely process would be a special meeting of the standing party committee members. (This is what happened when George McGovern replaced Sen. Thomas Eagleton with Sargent Shriver in 1972.) More complicated is the issue of ballot access — some state deadlines have already passed, and early voting starts in just a few weeks in some states. These are practical issues, and could be resolvable with some effort. Nevertheless, it’s important to get the ballots right. Even though we learned in 2016 that voters really cast their ballots for their states’ slate of electors, the wrong candidate for vice president would be a bad look at best and a potential constitutional confrontation at worst. (If no vice presidential candidate wins a majority of electors, the Senate chooses the vice president.) The informal element of the process would be similar in some ways to replacing the top spot, yet different in crucial aspects. As with replacing the presidential candidate, there would be some serious party coordination needs. Parties, as my co-author William Adler and I find in our work on running mates, play a role in shaping VP choices. Nevertheless, the presidential candidate plays a huge role in narrowing down the selection and making the final choice. This leaves room for all kinds of possibilities as we speculate about what could happen next. Importantly, Trump (or someone) would need to convince Vance to step down before the formal efforts to replace him would even be a realistic possibility. Then comes the question of who would replace Vance on the ticket. Here’s where things get interesting, with possible party jockeying in public and behind the scenes, as well as possible tensions within the campaign and between campaign and party. Some might theorize that Trump should look to politicians from the crucial swing states where the campaign has lost ground — start thumbing through the roster of GOP politicians from Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, for example. He could go back to his original short list and select Doug Burgum or Marco Rubio, both who have sought the presidential nomination and been through some national vetting. He could emphasize bringing someone from an underrepresented group to the ticket — Nikki Haley, Tim Scott or Vivek Ramaswamy (or Rubio) come to mind as possibilities. Ramaswamy, whose energetic RNC speech addressed some of the party’s outreach problems to minority communities, might especially be seen as a natural replacement for Vance. He’s also young and a loyal, dedicated Trump acolyte. But he has never held political office. Or Trump might look at some of the women whose names were floated earlier this year — like Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., to try to match the energy among women in light of Harris’ historic candidacy. These are approaches that Trump could try, if he chose to go the risky route of replacing the vice presidential candidate — which, again, is quite unlikely. And that doesn’t mean that they would even work. Politicians who were passed over on the first round may not want to join a ticket that’s since suffered some setbacks, and no longer seems like such a safe bet for victory. A choice aimed at “targeting” women, Midwesterners or minority voters also might not work. Social science research suggests that these efforts rarely succeed. A main purpose of the vice presidential candidate, beyond avoiding harm or generating negative news cycles, is to highlight the presidential candidate’s judgment and values. Because Trump has already served as president, most people have already made up their minds about how they feel about these factors. Dumping Vance would almost certainly generate a news cycle that would be negative for the former president, casting doubt on his judgment and drawing further attention to his running mate’s missteps and flaws. It’s likely simply too late for Trump to pick someone else. And VP candidate replacements happen so rarely, and are so closely connected to campaign disasters like McGovern’s in 1972, that it would be hard to achieve the quiet, under-the-radar rollout that might have been the wiser strategy in the first place."
"Democrats party in Chicago, the city Republicans most love to hate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-chicago-republicans-crime-rcna166573,"Fed up with the repeated condemnations of their city — condemnations that are regularly uttered by former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party and Fox News — a few enterprising Chicagoans encapsulated their rage on T-shirts last year. “Shut the f--- up about Chicago,” one of those shirts reads. “You don’t live here.” Don’t count on Republicans heeding that advice. Because the city is run by Democrats and because it is wrongly perceived as majority Black and singularly violent, Republicans have used “Chicago” as a kind of code word. Chicago, in their telling, is what you get when Democrats are in charge and Black people have run amok. In an argument that ignores the bright-blue city’s adjacency to bright-red Indiana and its anything-goes gun culture, Republican critics cite Chicago as proof that gun restrictions don’t work. But just as Democrats aren’t letting Republicans define their candidates, their policies or their record, they’re not letting the GOP define the city hosting this week’s Democratic National Convention. Throwing the party’s big party in Chicago is a more polite way of expressing the message on the T-shirts mentioned above. It is a way of saying that Chicago isn’t what Republicans want everybody else to believe it is. Let’s start with the idea of crime, specifically murders. Does Chicago have the most of any American city? Yes. But there are only two cities in the country — New York and Los Angeles — that are bigger than Chicago. In fact, with 2.7 million people, Chicago has more people than 15 states. In December, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., disregarded data that shows that Louisiana has the second-highest firearm death rate in the nation as he maligned Chicago as ""America’s largest outdoor shooting range."" As Jeff Asher, of the data analysis research firm AH Datalytics, said in a phone conversation Thursday, “Chicago has the most of everything only because it has almost the most people. In terms of [crime] rates, Chicago is usually outside of the top 10 in terms of murder rate, violent crime.” “Memphis; St. Louis; New Orleans; Birmingham, Alabama; Detroit,” he said when asked to name the most violent cities in the country. “Detroit is probably going to have the fewest murders since the early ’60s. Still has a high murder rate. New Orleans has seen a 40% reduction in murder relative to 2022. Still has a reasonably high murder rate, so that hasn’t changed.” But the emphasis stays on Chicago. Less than a week into his term as president, Trump tweeted, “If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!” In late 2019, when he finally made his first presidential visit to Chicago, he said of the city, “It’s embarrassing to us as a nation. All over the world, they’re talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison. It’s true.” “I think Chicago has issues,” Asher said, “but it’s also generally following the trends everywhere else. And it’s not the only place with issues.” Like so many other American cities, he said, in Chicago “murder rose substantially in 2020, 2021, and then has been coming down steadily ever since.” Generally speaking, Americans have become awful judges of how bad crime is. There used to be a relationship between the prevalence of crime and the perception of crime, Asher said, “but I don’t think there is anymore. I think people have created in their minds the situation where either crime is going up or the data is wrong.” In the 1990s, how people felt about crime “matched up pretty closely” to how much crime there was. “Ever since then, the share of people that told Gallup that crime is going up has been above 50% regardless of the direction that crime has gone that year.” My intent here is not to misrepresent Chicago as less violent than it is. One wishes Chicago were as safe as the much more populated New York City. But Americans misperceive actual levels of crime in part because Republicans want them to misperceive it. They need to hype crime levels to make the political points they want to make — because the actual data says otherwise. I say I wish Chicago were as safe as New York, but even New York is a crime-ridden hellhole in the Republican imagination. While visiting the city to show support for a former Republican president on trial for 34 felony counts, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., told Fox News, “The streets are filthy, they’re covered with people basically dying on drugs. They can’t even stand up. They’re falling over. There’s so much crime in the city. I can’t comprehend how people live there.” An October report from the Brennan Center for Justice crunched 2020-2022 data from the FBI and other sources and found that the murder rate per 100,000 people is highest in the South (8.0) and lowest in the Northeast (4.5). And that New York (with 5.3 murders per 100,000 people) was far less deadly than Atlanta, where Greene has been an untold number of times and apparently not been killed. Atlanta, according to Brennan, had 33.9 murders per 100,000 people. The Republican animosity for big American cities intensified during Ronald Reagan’s time in the White House, and it seems never to have let up. In the GOP imagination, every big city, especially if it’s run by a Democrat, is terrifying. If Republicans want to proffer Chicago as the epitome of urban America, meaning dangerous and frightening, then it’s important for Democrats to embrace Chicago to show that what happens in our cities matters to them, and that our country can’t succeed if our cities are forsaken. The “Shut the f--- up about Chicago” T-shirts were created by Anthony Hall, the owner of the clothing company Harebrained. Hall says he was inspired after a friend alerted him to a Fox News segment where a correspondent asked people in Naperville, Illinois — an hour’s drive from Chicago — their opinion of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson being sworn into office. That friend, Chicago marketer Matt Lindner, told Block Club Chicago that “Chicago has been the punching bag for people of certain political persuasions.” Chicagoans know the city has problems, he said, “but if you’re simply creating the narrative that it’s a war zone without being constructive about solutions or how there’s good people working on it, then,” well, see the T-shirt."
My common thread with JD Vance’s Mamaw make his remarks cut extra deep,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-mamaw-postmenopausal-female-rcna166666,"In 1984, a boy was born in a small town near Cincinnati and raised amid family chaos. Addiction. Abuse. Absent father. Poverty. His grandmother swooped in to provide consistency for him and his sister. He was grateful for his Mamaw’s steady presence even as she struggled to raise two grandchildren well into her 70s. That boy grew up to be Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, who in his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” credits his grandmother for his success. With a sense of guilt and empathy, he notes that she never got to realize her dream of becoming a lawyer for abused and neglected children. “Mamaw had her dreams but never the opportunity to pursue them,” he writes. He remembers watching her walk around the house cloaked in “weariness she wore like a dark piece of clothing,” and ignoring “whispers from a lot of people to Mamaw that she just needed to take a break and enjoy her golden years.” None of that compassion was evident, though, when Vance went on a podcast in 2020 and chewed the fat about the role that grandmothers play. The podcast host said “the whole purpose of the postmenopausal female” is to help raise grandchildren, and Vance heartily agreed. By agreeing with that, Vance did violence to his grandmother’s memory. The same woman who struggled to raise her own children as a teen mom was called upon to take full responsibility for him and his sister when she was a senior citizen. Due in no small part to sexist gender expectations like those expressed in the podcast and scant public policies to support families, Vance’s Mamaw was trapped in a loop of intense, oppressive caregiving that demands that women take care of some loved ones from the cradle and take care of other loved ones to the grave. Instead of offering caregiving grandmothers empty praise and sexist pigeonholes, Mr. Vance, how about some fundamental policy change? I was a naïve wife and mother of two before I realized how difficult it is to raise kids in this family-unfriendly nation. I could have used access to safe, quality, affordable child care and to universal health care that would have made it easier to switch jobs without fear of losing health insurance. Instead, I was parenting in a world where there’d been a women’s movement, but nothing else had moved. The stress was so intense that I left my job to work part time. The decision was a no-brainer. My children were loved and very much wanted. They didn’t ask to be here, and I owed them my best. But the sacrifice was monumental. According to the Center for American Progress, a woman who is 26 (the average age of first-time mothers in the United States) and earns $44,000 annually will lose a cumulative $707,000 over her career if she stays out of the workforce for five years. That amount includes potential raises, benefits and pensions she forgoes by dropping out of full-time work. Here Vance might ask me: “Where were the grandmothers to help you with your children?” Such a question would not only reflect the sexist values of a bygone era, but it would also ignore the current reality of women’s lives. I wish I could say my children’s grandmothers were knitting booties at home waiting for the chance to fulfill what Vance believes was their life’s purpose. Instead, my mother was 720 miles away, spending her post-menopausal years helping my father keep their small business afloat. My mother-in-law lived two doors away. But she had seven children, four of whom were still in school when I gave birth to her first grandchild. She was busy raising children while managing her husband’s medical practice. It’s a rare woman in her 50s who can afford to leave her job and uproot her life for the benefit of her grandchildren, and society needs to stop assuming that they should. At midlife, I found myself divorced after 25 years of marriage and eager to put my own dreams back on the priority list. After all, the children were launched, and I was not yet a grandmother. But in 2016, both of my parents were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. After trying to support them from afar, as the oldest child and the only girl, I was compelled to move to care for them. According to the Family Caregiver Alliance, caregiving reduces paid work hours for middle-aged women by about 41%. If an older female caregiver steps out of the workforce, the financial impact in terms of lost wages and Social Security benefits for the rest of her life is $324,044. This doesn’t account for the psychological and physical stress caregiving exacts upon women, or the additional out-of-pocket expenses they often expend to support the sick or aging. My dad passed away in 2020. The weekend of his funeral, my daughter moved in with her three kids to escape an abusive marriage. Four years later, the caregiving journey for my parents is over; my mother slipped away peacefully this year at age 90. But now I’m the full-time guardian of my grandchildren. When the youngest graduates from high school, I’ll be 76. But, according to Vance, at least I would have fulfilled the reason for which I was born. I count myself as lucky to have been in the position to give my best to my children, take care of my parents until they drew their last breaths and catch my grandchildren when life dealt them a raw deal. I would have sacrificed everything to support them. In fact, I practically have. At 64, I’ll never be able to make up for the income, savings and retirement benefits I’ve forgone supporting generations of people I love. Instead of relying upon women to provide a lifetime of free care for others, perhaps Vance can honor his Mamaw with policies that expand health insurance for family caregivers, establish a national child care system, provide broader access to mental health services and create caregiver-friendly tax and retirement policies? Until that happens, women will continue to shoulder the cost of providing decades of free care — and, in terms of blood and treasure, paying for it dearly."
