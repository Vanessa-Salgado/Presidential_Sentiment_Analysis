Dems played Trump’s game better than he does on Night 2 of the DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/night-2-dnc-obamas-pritzker-trump-roast-rcna167577,"Democrats turned Night 2 of the Democratic National Convention into a full-on Donald Trump roast session. The best mockery all shared a consistent theme: Trump is too small a man to be deserving of the presidency because America has outgrown his petulant, self-serving type of leadership. Tuesday was cathartic for those in the Democratic Party who wanted to see Democrats show some resolve by fighting back against Trump’s unhinged insults with a lil’ flavor of their own. And many of them delivered with some pointed jabs at his self-image.  Trump and his followers like to portray him as a larger-than-life figure — an icon, an American idol. But with their carefully placed digs, Democrats brought him down to size with remarks about his smallness or weakness: his unimpressive intellect, his juvenile self-obsession, his unstable finances, and his petty competitiveness about … crowd sizes. Here are some of my highlights: Former President Barack Obama’s quip mocking Trump’s weird focus on crowd sizes — and the, shall we say, suggestive hand gesture Obama made while cracking the joke — have taken the internet by storm. Seriously, great comedic timing from Obama here. But the underlying point was a powerful one: Trump is too concerned with trivial score-setting to be an effective president. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s remarks about Trump’s rabid attacks on her and her husband over the years portrayed Trump as a petty bigot. A man too small-minded and self-conscious to respect two hard-working Black people who ascended to great heights on their own merit — and, unlike him, couldn’t “expect an escalator to take us to the top” when confronted with a mountain. “His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black,” she said. U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks lobbed a similar attack when she claimed Trump and his movement have consumed America’s focus and limited our political imagination.  The Maryland Democrat said:  Other than Barack Obama, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker may have hurt Trump’s ego the most with his comments mocking Trump’s finances and his intelligence at once. ""Donald Trump thinks that we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich,” Pritzker said. “But take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”  Pritzker and his fellow Democrats had the DNC feeling like Def Comedy Jam at points on Tuesday, which clearly played well in the room and online. But importantly, they used those jokes to pivot to the very real, very serious discussion about the threat a second Trump election might pose to American democracy. Good speechcraft all around."
My dad taught me to love conventions. Now I'm worried for their future.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dad-love-dnc-trump-terrified-future-rcna167559,"Join Luke, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event. Buy tickets here. “Guess where I am?” It was the summer of 1992, and I could barely make out my father’s question. “Where?” “I’m on the third baseline of the Astrodome. On the field! Right where Ken Caminiti plays!” Dad was speaking my language. At 7 years old, I may not have known who Dan Quayle was, but I definitely knew the Astros’ third baseman. “Watch for me.” And so I tuned into my first convention, at least, that I can remember. To my disappointment, Dad wasn’t reporting from a baseball diamond. The 1992 Republican National Convention was packed with people in silly hats, draped in banners and flags. They cheered speakers in suits and danced during breaks. When the speeches were done, Tom Brokaw appeared to tell us what they meant. The common connective tissue was red, white, blue. Even at 7, I knew this celebration of the American democratic experiment mattered. But conventions probably mattered for me more than most. My parents met at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City. Dad was an aide to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mom was a writer for the Village Voice. There’s nothing like tracing your eventual birth back to the Carter-Mondale campaign. Four years later, the DNC served as the defining moment of my father’s political career. Before becoming the revered moderator of “Meet the Press,” he spent a distinguished decade in New York politics. First in Buffalo, then with Moynihan and eventually with Gov. Mario Cuomo. The 1984 DNC in San Francisco bore witness to Cuomo’s heralded “Tale of Two Cities” speech. As the governor’s counselor and communications director, Dad helped write more than 60 drafts. Line by line, Cuomo shattered Ronald Reagan’s presentation of America as a shining city on the hill and reminded folks about the dark forgotten side of Reagan’s idealistic American projection. I think Dad knew he’d never top that — and switched careers. My first convention was the 2000 RNC in Philadelphia, holding my father’s duffel bag of research. I don’t recall much aside from Dad putting me on the spot to do an imitation of The Rock, in front of the WWE star, in the NBC booth. In 2004, I watched a state senator from Illinois deliver the speech that would launch him on a path to the White House; I watched New Yorkers pay tribute to President George W. Bush’s perfect first pitch at the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium, thrown while Ground Zero was still a smoldering heap of dust and debris. The video narrated by the late Sen. Fred Thompson brought the entire convention to tears. Dad died on June 13, 2008. I gave a eulogy that resonated with a lot of people — including TV executives at NBC — who gave me the unique opportunity to launch my reporting career from the 2008 conventions. They were familiar ground. My Dad believed they showcase the best of American democracy. “Conventions are where you tell the people who you are, what you’re about,” he once told me. Each side pumping up their candidate and having a conversation with the nation, free from censorship or sabotage. I don’t think in his darkest thoughts, he’d ever imagine an America where democracy could very well be at stake. He passed away a few days after The Economist published a cover of John McCain and Barack Obama titled “America at its best.” He died when our presidential election was between a popular maverick and a young senator headlining a historic campaign. The election of America’s first Black president was supposed to be the start of a more unified post-racial society, but instead turned into a long-drawn-out campaign of division and disdain. I witnessed the beginning. I watched Obama accept the nomination from inside a football stadium. Just a few decades after Black Americans achieved equal access to the ballot box. A wave of change was churning deep. I was on the convention floor in Minneapolis when Sarah Palin stole her running mate's thunder and launched the underpinnings of what is now the MAGA movement. I felt bad for McCain, ever the loyal soldier to his party, as he got sucked into a vortex he could no longer control. It was evident he was uncomfortable with what had spawned. At the Tampa RNC in 2012, just two years after the ascension of the tea party, GOP nominee Mitt Romney, a humble and decent man, said he wished Obama “had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn’t something we have to accept.” Can you imagine hearing that today at a Republican convention? I watched 2016 on TV, thankful to be out of politics. Yet, I felt an urge to participate. Conventions have that power. But I didn’t return for another eight years. This week, I’m back in Chicago. Back where it all started personally and professionally. Yet, there’s a gutting feeling this could be the last. As my former colleague Brian Williams framed it so eloquently during his last MSNBC show: The former firefighter’s warning did not fall on deaf ears. It’s OK to be scared. These are not normal times. Not long ago, the events of Jan. 6 would have forced a national party into some soul-searching. Instead, the GOP has reverted to the mean — and nominated the man responsible for the domestic terrorist attack at the Capitol. Loyalists who do not believe the results of the 2020 election occupy important electoral positions in pivotal states. By design, it’s now harder to vote in many places in America than it was four years ago. Experts on authoritarianism watched this year’s RNC with alarm. Attendees yelled “Fight! Fight Fight!” as their leader appeared, still sporting the bandage from a near-assassination attempt. The scenes reminded some of 1930s Germany. And, indeed, the Republican nominee seems hell-bent on vengeance, stating his desire to prosecute political opponents and deploy the United States military in a domestic capacity. Make no mistake, America benefits from having a major conservative party. I lived in San Francisco and have seen firsthand the limits of liberalism. Endless group think and vicious party politics coming before the concerns of the people is a recipe for a disaster. There’s a reason our founders strived for balance. But I’ve also traveled and spent time in Turkey, once the democratic jewel of a troubled region. In the last eight years, academics, judges and dissidents have been jailed on bogus charges. Opposition parties harassed and threatened by an increasingly autocratic regime. People distrusting of their neighbors. It was never supposed to happen in Turkey. It’s not paranoid to worry about America slowly slipping into a less democratic country. The people’s will can be contorted for authoritative rule. Despite the lurking danger, Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz have espoused “happy warrior” personas. They are not distraught; they project a sunny optimism and inherent belief that the American people want to see a freer and more democratic future. Polling suggests Harris has erased much of Trump’s lead, buoyed by enthusiasm from youth and minority voters. Co-opting the GOP’s ""freedom"" rhetoric, Harris and Walz are pushing for an America where citizens are free from autocratic tendencies, gun violence, judicial overreach and discrimination. Democrats are framing a clear choice for voters — does freedom mean being able to buy an assault rifle or birth control pills? All conventions are deemed to be “historic,” but in 2024, this is not hyperbole. If Trump wins, conventions in 2028 may look very different. A first step of autocratic regimes is outlawing rival parties — and their ability to meet. We hope that such a travesty would never happen in this country. But we cannot know for sure that it won’t. No matter your political ideology, enjoy the DNC this week. Do not take it for granted. We are not a land of kings and queens, but of immigrants and empowered voters. My late father’s era in politics feels long gone. Civility is an afterthought and democracy feels more fleeting. But Chicago will be flooded with effervescent American pride for the next few days, at least. Let’s cherish it."
Trump’s interactions with Israel’s Netanyahu draw fresh scrutiny,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-interactions-israels-netanyahu-draw-fresh-scrutiny-rcna167580,            
Doug Emhoff got personal about Harris and their blended family at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-democratic-national-convention-rcna167538,"Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, spoke admiringly of his wife, Vice President Kamala Harris, and their blended family Tuesday night, pitching her to voters as a tough but trustworthy leader. ""Kamala is a joyful warrior,"" Emhoff said, employing a term that has come to define her campaign. ""And here’s the thing about joyful warriors: They’re still warriors, and Kamala is as tough as they come."" Emhoff charted his relationship with Harris from their first blind date — ""For generations, people have debated when to call the person you're being set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m., and yet that's when I dialed."" — to how easily she fit in with his family. Emhoff, who has two children from a previous marriage, spoke affectionately about his blended family, which right-wing figures have sought to make a point of attack against Harris for not having biological children. “Those of you who belong in blended families know that they can be a little complicated,” he said. “But as soon as our kids started calling her ‘Momala,’ I knew we’d be OK.” Emhoff's speech on the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a reintroduction of sorts for himself, too. He talked about his childhood in New Jersey and his fantasy football league. The first Jewish spouse of a U.S. president or vice president, Emhoff said that Harris — who is Baptist and was raised in a Christian and Hindu household — has helped deepen his connection to his faith. Harris is scheduled to accept her party’s nomination Thursday, which Emhoff said is also their 10th wedding anniversary. He urged voters to trust Harris with their families as he did his. ""America, in this election you have to decide who to trust with your family’s future,"" he said. ""I trusted Kamala with our family’s future; it was the best decision I ever made."""
Was J6 a Precursor?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-was-j6-precursor-rcna167581,"As Donald Trump’s sentencing date approaches, he and his lawyers are throwing all the spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord break down the former president’s request to adjourn his sentencing until after the election, and the Manhattan DA’s response. Then, ProPublica reporter Joshua Kaplan joins for a deep dive into his reporting on unlawful American militia groups. Andrew and Mary talk with him about the threat these paramilitary groups pose, how they’ve used Trump’s denial of the election results for recruitment and spreading their ideology, as well as the dangers of collaboration with law enforcement.   Here is Josh Kaplan’s ProPublica investigation: Armed and Underground: Inside the Turbulent, Secret World of an American Militia. (Included is a response from Meta about the use of Facebook as a recruitment tool.) Also a note: We’re expecting a joint filing in the DC case next Tuesday, so we’ll release our episode on Wednesday so Mary and Andrew can detail what’s in that filing.  Andrew Weissmann: Hi and welcome to Prosecuting Donald Trump. It is Tuesday morning, August 20th. I’m Andrew Weissman and I’m here with my wonderful co-host, Mary McCord. How are you, Mary? Mary McCord: I’m well this morning. How are you? It’s actually unbelievably cool in Washington, D.C. this Tuesday morning. It was in the 60s with coffee on the back porch. I had a run and didn’t feel like I was about to die. So very happy with the change in the weather. Andrew Weissmann: So, it’s so funny you said that because it must have been a cold front on the East Coast because I’m up North and it was in the low 50s. Mary McCord: Yeah. Wow. Well, you’ve got a flannel shirt on. I can see. Andrew Weissmann: I’ve got a flannel shirt on and I’ve got wool slippers on. I mean, it’s just like grandpa here. Mary McCord: Yeah, there you go. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, we have such a different and great show and it’s such an important thing. And I just want to say we have a guest on as people know from who listen to this, we don’t typically have guests. And what we’re trying to do here is really talk about something that is preventative. You know, we’ve talked a lot about the four criminal cases, but we have this wonderful guest in an area that Mary, you are such a national expert in because of your, I hate to say it, day job. The day job outside of this podcast, but we’re going to talk about militias. And we’re really going to talk about the problem and trying to anticipate what could happen and how to deal with what could happen as opposed to talking about the criminal cases of what happened. Mary McCord: Right. We’re looking forward, not backward. So that guest is Josh Kaplan. He’s a reporter with “ProPublica” and he will be joining us in our second and third segments to talk about his new deeply investigated piece about one of the largest American militia groups and the threat that that group and others pose to our democracy and to public safety. It’s a piece that I talked with him about while he was reporting on it. But before we get to that, Andrew, we do have to update and give our own thoughts on the latest. And I will say, last week when we did our podcast, I said, I’ll bet you anything, Trump comes in right away and seeks to postpone his sentencing in Manhattan. Well, not that it took any kind of like crystal balls -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- to make that up. Yeah, I know. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, how did you possibly think that would happen? Mary McCord: That is going out on the limb, Mary. But it was really quick, right? It was not waiting till September 16th till Judge Merchan makes his decision on immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: It was like immediate. You should right now postpone this. And that was done by letter form. So let’s kick it off there, Andrew, your reactions to not only the request to postpone sentencing to, let’s be clear, after the election, but also the D.A.’s response because he responded quite quickly. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So his response was unsealed yesterday. So I first have a sort of caddy response to Donald Trump’s submission. It’s a one-page letter that is the most unreadable letter. Mary McCord: It’s really bad, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: It’s single-spaced at the margins change so that it goes from one end to the other. And it’s almost impossible to read. Mary McCord: I agree. Andrew Weissmann: And it’s also a bit of stream of consciousness. Mary McCord: Totally. Andrew Weissmann: We’ve talked about his filing, his legal filing to Judge Merchan and how, like, my guess is it was not written by the trial team. It reads like it was written by Supreme Court advocates in anticipation of where this is going to go. It was in striking contrast to the letter, which was basically in form unreadable and in substance unreadable. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But just so people understand what their argument is, because if you strip away the detritus and get to the substance, what they’re really saying is, look, Judge, the way you’ve done this is that you’ve got a ruling that’s coming out on the immunity issues on September 16th, and assuming you rule against us, you are going to have sentencing on September 18th. That’s two days. And we think, that we have appellate rights, whether it’s state or federal appellate rights, but you’ve only given us essentially kind of a day to do that in which case we would seek a stay from you, we would seek a stay from an appellate court, because we shouldn’t have sentencing if this use of immunized testimony is something that we have a right to appeal. So that’s sort of the argument is sort of the short timeframe. Mary McCord: And I would also just say, that is an interesting legal issue that I think we should spend a few minutes on. Like you mentioned, there’s a bunch of other stuff in here like revisiting the recusal and -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- saying essentially to sentence would mean -- Andrew Weissmann: Fourth time. This is the fourth time. Mary McCord: Yes, exactly. I’m like, please already. That’s another reason. And saying that if the D.A. files a sentencing recommendation that’s public, that would be prejudicial and election interference. Well, the D.A. responds, of course by law, sentencing recommendations are confidential and not made public unless the court makes them public and so on and so forth. So like you said, peel away that detritus. Do I have a legal question that has never been resolved because it’s never come up before because we never had a case like Trump v. United States before and that’s of course what we’ve talked about before and what Judge Merchan now has to decide. Was there such evidence that was introduced at trial at all? And if so, does that mean Trump’s entitled to entirely new trial, or does that mean that evidence could be harmless air? Those are questions that we all have our legal opinions about, but then the real question here is, whatever the ruling is, if it’s not getting rid of the case, which is what Mr. Trump wants, does he have a right to immediately appeal that? And as we talked about -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- usually you appeal after -- Andrew Weissmann: After. Mary McCord: -- sentencing. And we know from the immunity decision that is an exception to getting an ability to appeal during a criminal case. But that is all about appealing before you were even made to go to trial because you’re immune. Here we’re after trial. There’s not an argument he was prosecuted for official acts. The only argument is that evidence of official acts may have been introduced and we had that legal discussion about whether anything that he’s claiming was official really was official. And so it’s just unanswered whether you get any right to appeal that before your sentencing. And I could argue it both ways. Andrew Weissmann: Right, the real issue here is, is there a right to appeal that? Most defendants will say there’s all sorts of errors in their trial. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And by the way, sometimes they may be right -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- that there’s an error, but the way the law works is that’s something that you get to appeal after the trial and after sentencing and then you appeal it and if the court agrees with you, the case could get dismissed or they could go back for a retrial. It could go back for a resentencing. But in terms of the timeline, you don’t get to say, wait a second before sentencing, I want to appeal. So there’s sort of that issue. But Mary, as you noted, because this involves alleged immunized testimony, the question that the Supreme Court has not answered is could you have that interim appeal here? And so that is this open issue. So the D.A. has basically taken sort of a middle road. He didn’t agree with Donald Trump that this sentencing should be put off on the 18th. He didn’t disagree. He basically said, we leave it to you, judge, to make this decision. And he did note, however, that there is this appellate issue. There is this time issue. So he does sort of, to use your phrase, where he gives a sort of permission structure to the judge if he were to say there should be more time, but he doesn’t actually say he wants it or he’s against it. There may be a whole number of political reasons. There may be just a variety of reasons that he doesn’t want to jam up the judge by saying no or yes and say, we defer to you. And by the way, Mary, a lot of times in my career, that’s sort of the right thing. Mary McCord: I agree. I probably would have done the same thing. Andrew Weissmann: There are other times, especially in a high profile matter, where it could be viewed, and I’m not saying it applies here, but when I think about my high profile matters, where it’s not terribly appreciated by the court to have the government saying, hey, you take the heat on this, we’re not going to take a position and we’re going to let everyone yell at you -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- whether it goes forward or not. Here, the D.A. has certainly protected himself from a little bit of the claim of politicization, -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- of a rush. On the other hand, as Nicole Wallace likes to say, who you talking to? I mean, Donald Trump will always say it’s politicized no matter what you do in this. Mary McCord: So this is actually the point kind of that I wanted to bring up while reading these that when you think of it, like I understand D.A. Bragg taking that position because he’s now in a box of if I say, no, you’ve got to go forward for accountability, et cetera, then he’s going to take criticism. And also just in terms of the D.A., they’ve achieved getting 34 guilty verdicts, right, from a jury, so that’s a very successful thing. They’ve shown the world the evidence of what Donald Trump did. So this last piece is the sentencing and I think they would agree and maybe not everyone would agree, but a lot of people would agree that even if given a sentence that would include jail time, a judge probably would allow that to be deferred until after appeal anyway. So they might be thinking, look, the stakes here are such that we’re okay saying, judge, if you think we need to postpone, we’re going to leave that to you, notwithstanding that we don’t think there’s really any merit to the argument about inappropriate admission of official acts testimony at trial. But the problem when you put this whole picture together, when you look at the history of this criminal prosecution, as well as the other three, we talked a little bit about this last week, is you look at how successful Trump has actually been at manipulating the system, right? Andrew Weissmann: Totally. Mary McCord: Like the sentencing was supposed to be July 11th, the trial was supposed to be earlier than it was, right? Then the sentencing got put off. And you know, now he’s put everyone in a box of being able to say this is political when he’s the one who pushed everything up to the very last minute like this through all of his delay tactics. And so it’s deeply unsatisfying to see those tactics work because for other people, you know, people go to trial in criminal cases every day and they don’t have this ability to just put everything off and never have to have true accountability. To me, it really emphasizes sort of the dual system that we have, unfortunately. Andrew Weissmann: I couldn’t agree with you more. Two very quick points. I know a lot of people are probably thinking, well, I think what should be the guiding principle here with respect to Donald Trump is treating him like anyone else, that if this is how anyone else would be treated, he should be treated this way. The problem with that analysis is that, of course that’s true, but there is this open legal issue about when you could -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- appeal and whether it would be something that you could have pre-trial or pre-sentencing or not. And so it’s not an easy thing to apply the rule of treat him like everyone else because it’s treat him like everyone else who has this legal issue. Mary McCord: And no one else has had that, right? Andrew Weissmann: Right. So it does complicate that because my strong inclination is, of course, that, you know what, it doesn’t matter what the ramifications are publicly if he’s being treated like anyone else. That’s a hard issue. The second is I do think the judge has put in a little bit of an unusual situation. He has not ruled yet on the immunity issue and he’s being asked to put off the September 18th date based on an assumption about what will happen on September 16th. And usually judges don’t do that. It’d be like, look, I’m going to rule on September 16th and if you have an application at that point for a delay or an adjournment, I mean, it’s just an odd position to decide now before the ruling that, gee, I need more time because I think, hypothetically -- Mary McCord: Because I think I might need more time. Andrew Weissmann: Right, exactly. It’s sort of like, you know what? It’s somewhat premature in that the party should go ahead and I’m going to be issuing my decision. And for all you know, my decision might be favorable to you. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: In which case, there’s no reason to not have the A team as the next date for doing something. For instance, also the judge could decide he wants to hear evidence. And so there are a lot of things that could happen. So, it’ll be interesting. But just so everyone understands, we do not have a decision from Judge Merchan on this disputed issue or sort of disputed issue. And we should be getting that, I would think, at any moment. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, Mary, why don’t we take a break here and when we return, we are going to hear from Josh Kaplan on his reporting in “ProPublica” focused on America right-wing militia groups and the future dangers of extremists collaborating with law enforcement, politicians, even just acting on their own. We’ll be back with him in a moment. Mary McCord: Yes, let’s do it. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As we mentioned at the top, our guest today is Josh Kaplan. He’s been a reporter at “ProPublica” since 2020. People may be familiar with his byline from recent really blockbuster reporting about the Supreme Court ethical issues for “ProPublica.” I shouldn’t say the Supreme Court as a whole ethical issues, in particular, a couple of Supreme Court justices ethical issues, and that has been ongoing reporting for some time now that has been really, really impactful. He also has reported on the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. He’s reported on the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and many other important subjects. “ProPublica,” of course, does in-depth investigative reporting and he has rightly earned not only a Pulitzer for that reporting, but also a George Polk Award and Edward R. Murrow Award and other awards. But what we have Josh here with us today to talk about is his latest investigative piece. In fact, it’s one that he and I talked about while he was doing that reporting because it’s on a subject that is something that I work on in my day job, my non-podcast job. And that is reporting about a really deep dive into an American militia group. And by militia group, I mean an unlawful private paramilitary organization. The title of this article is “Armed and Underground: Inside the Turbulent Secret World of an American Militia” and we will post a link to that piece in our show notes. So, Josh, as we kick it off here, I do want to make clear that these groups are not lawful, but I’ll save that for a moment. I know what you did here as you dove really deeply into one particular organization. There are many across the country and they’ve sort of existed really since the founding of the country. But this modern militia movement, I would say dates to the ‘90s and in particular things like the Oklahoma City bombing, which of course was not committed by a person who was at that time doing it as part of a militia, but it was committed by somebody, Timothy McVeigh, who had been involved in the militia movement, including being present at Waco and really discussing and being involved in militias for some time, including in his younger years. So just to kind of table set here for our listeners, when you’re talking in this article about militia or paramilitary organization, what are you really talking about? Josh Kaplan: Yeah. I mean, I think loosely speaking, it is these wide variety of groups and their kind of chief shared traits are an emphasis on armed military style training and this sense or belief that they are the last line of defense against the excesses of the government or the excesses of the left. And how those two kind of factors have manifested in terms of the sort of activities they do have changed significantly since the modern movement really started in the early ‘90s. Andrew Weissmann: I wonder, Josh, if you could talk about, because we’re going to spend so much time on their tactics and how they’re going about doing things, and that’s going to get to the legality of what they’re doing, and it’s complicated, but not as complicated as people think as Mary’s going to explained. Mary McCord: I would say it’s not complicated at all, just to interject on that, but we’ll get to that in just a moment. Andrew Weissmann: So I think it’s useful to try to understand what do they want? Is there some unifying thread for what the sort of current militia movement is in terms of what are their goals? Are they seeking political reform? Is it economic? Is it racial? What is it that they want? Josh Kaplan: It’s a fascinating question because it’s harder than you’d think it’d be, because it’s such an unusual thing to go off and join a militia and dedicate an enormous amount of your life to preparing for war, essentially. But for a lot of these militias, including this large militia I was looking at, kind of deliberately, there’s not a clearly defined goal. It’s a very capacious and vague ideology. So the mission statement of this group I was looking at, which has long been one of the largest militias in the United States, is something I’m going off memory here, but resisting all efforts to undermine the Constitution and the American way of life and we will restore America to the glory it once was. And there’s a lot of disagreement amongst the members of this group. Some of them are at least, you know, have significant ties to the white nationalist movement and they’re very upset about anti-white racism. A lot of really common threads are they’re worried about gun control, they’re worried about COVID restrictions, voter fraud, alleged voter fraud. But because, I think, this kind of modern post-Obama form of militias don’t have these very clear mission statements that you might have seen in the earlier days when the white supremacist movement was really the main show in town in terms of far-right extremism. And that allows them to be more flexible, to be able to kind of morph themselves to bring in more people that are in positions of power, whether that’s in law enforcement, in government, and allows them to deal a little bit better with moments of extreme controversy, like we saw on January 6th. Mary McCord: Yeah. And also I do want to make sure listeners are aware that the reason that Josh is not naming this group, I mean, that was at our request. I’ve been studying this long enough, and Josh knows his mission’s a little different when he’s reporting, that all media attention is good media attention, even when it’s got a negative focus. And I know from enough of my own work and my own writing on this issue that naming individuals, leaders, or groups, they love that. It then proliferates on social media, it’s used for recruitment, even if it’s negative. And so the fact is that the group that Josh studied, is really pretty emblematic, I think, of all the groups that I’ve studied in my career and that researchers brief me on pretty regularly about at least every two weeks on what’s happening. So that’s very deliberate on our part. But what Josh has experienced here, I think, shows the arc of what we’ve seen in terms of, you know, again, Timothy McVeigh, the attack on Oklahoma City was an anti-government based attack. And so we’ve seen the ebb and flow of sort of white supremacy as a motivation, even though they’ll often deny it. Christian nationalism, I’d say now, I’d ask you, Josh, if you think that’s kind of now being injected as sort of an overarching ideology. And I think of them as grifters and users. Whatever is the cultural issue of the moment, and particularly a cultural issue being promoted, at least in these last eight years by Donald Trump, is the issue they will grab a hold of and run with for their own purposes, whether it’s recruitment, whether it’s training, organizing, making public statements, et cetera. And so that’s why things like and that’s why we’re having you on this program, because things like the baseless claims of election fraud led, of course, in 2020 to there being not just violence of course on January 6th, but other episodes of violence before and after the election. So, before we move forward, let’s jump back a little bit to fill in this gap here about the rise of militia activity when Barack Obama became president because that is when I think this fear again of the government’s coming to take our guns really spurred a real relaunch of these groups. And it seems like you found that in your reporting as well. Josh Kaplan: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, how this was described to me. I mean, so this was a group that like a lot of the militias you might have heard about in the context of January 6, was founded in Obama’s first term. And at first it was basically an idea on Facebook, let’s make a militia, let’s all join together. But then it went from this kind of paper tiger to something with a real world physical presence relatively quickly. And kind of the impetus for that was they were able to capitalize on some of Obama’s gun control proposals that he started after the Sandy Hook shooting. And how this was described to me by militia leaders was we stopped having to look for people. They started coming to us and we’re having local chapters go from four or five people to more than 200 people in less than a year. And eventually, you know, had an active on-the-ground presence, not just an online presence in almost every state in the United States. Andrew Weissmann: I was wondering if there’s any sense, this is sort of tying what you’ve been talking about and what Mary’s been raising, this issue of how big a problem do we have now? I think for a lot of people, they thought that with the prosecutions of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, that there was this enormous deterrent effect and that this was largely, not entirely, but largely a problem behind us. But do you have a sense of how big a problem do we have now in spite of those prosecutions? Josh Kaplan: Yeah. I mean so, there’s a lot more to say about kind of the aftermath of January 6th and why they were able to overcome that. But I think this deterrence effect ended up being a lot smaller than the people inside the militias were anticipating because they know their history and they know that that’s the sort of thing that could destroy them. But they were able, you know, this militia I was looking at, was able to grow at a really kind of rapid pace in the time since then. And, you know, I think part of the reason that we don’t hear as much about them is they’ve done a good job of keeping their activity more underground. You know, before January 6th, you could tell on Facebook, if you were on the right Facebook groups, you could have some sense that there was something underway. But now they’re being more careful about that sort of operational security. And this group I was looking at, I mean, leaders in it are talking about how this upcoming election that in their view will be decided not at the ballot box, but at the ammo box. They’re talking about how they’re ready to force their way into voting centers if they have to or commit violence, whatever it takes. And also, I mean, I found this kind of eye opening that they have sometimes talked about January 6 as a botched job. The plans weren’t good enough. They didn’t go far enough. And if the militia movement hadn’t been weak, hadn’t been uncommitted, they could have really achieved something that day. And they don’t want to make that mistake twice. Mary McCord: I want to focus particularly on that in our last segment of the episode, but we did skip from sort of a resurgence when Obama became president to current. And I do think it’s important to fill in that block in between there, which you do fill in your story, Josh. And that is when Trump was elected, typically if we look back to the early ‘90s to forward, we would see sort of a difference in popularity and outward demonstrations, for example, of militia activity between administrations, depending, frankly, oftentimes on the politics of it, because there was more of a concern that with a Democrat in the White House, you know, there was going to be gun control. But what was really changed, also, I think, with the election of Donald Trump is a difference in permission structure and groups that have been anti-government suddenly found someone that they thought was on their side, but that someone was himself anti-government. So that’s the piece between sort of Obama administration and where we are now and this involvement in politics and elections. So maybe before the break, if you tell us a little bit about that piece and we’ll come back and focus on the present in our last segment. Josh Kaplan: As I think a lot of people remember from the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, which was when we first really saw this, militias and the broader far right became emboldened after Trump. They had more activity out in the open. I mean, in the Obama years, there were some scary plots that happened that were foiled by the FBI, but really, I mean, these guys spent a lot of their time out in the woods. And the main kind of chief threat of violence was towards federal agents and these sort of standoffs that often happened out West. And in the Trump years, you started seeing a lot more people in the streets, kind of proudly walking around with guns at rallies, gauging in various activities. It wasn’t Trump for the kind of anti-government or anti-government is no longer quite the right word, but this strain of the movement. Trump wasn’t universally a good thing. I think the first three years of Trump’s campaign, it became a little harder for them to recruit and that’s true for a lot of these groups. They were on the downswing. That all changed completely in 2020. COVID hits. All of these conspiracies they feared seemed to be coming true and Trump is legitimizing them. Trump’s tweeting, liberate Michigan, liberate Minnesota. And suddenly you get on this track that carries us through the summer with the protests around the murder of George Floyd. That also is real boon for these groups and they’re very active, patrolling city streets with assault rifles, with baseball bats, getting in violent confrontations with protesters. And then, of course, you have the 2020 election, Trump says it was stolen, and that brings us on this train of violence happening at several protests towards the end of the year, and then eventually January 6th. Andrew Weissmann: This is a good time for us to take a break. And when we come back, one thing that would be useful as we focus on tactics and violence is to maybe do some level setting on what the legal issues are here because I bet you that there are people listening this saying, why don’t we just, not to borrow this phrase, but why are these people not locked up? Why can’t they be prosecuted? What are the lines for bringing criminal accountability in terms of these actions and where do they cross over from legal to illegal? But with that, why don’t we take a break and we can come back and continue this discussion with Josh. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. Well, as Andrew knows, and Josh knows too, because he and I talked quite a while he was reporting his piece. I’m champing, that’s champing, not chomping, at the bit to talk about why this is unlawful. So just to be clear, folks, this is something my organization, my day job, we litigated against unlawful militias after Charlottesville, so that’s why this is something that is such great interest to me. And one of the things, as Josh indicated, that militias, and by that I mean private militia groups, because the only lawful militia is our actually federally and state authorized militias. So we’re talking about the National Guard or other state authorized militia groups that report through the governor, if they can be federalized and report through our U.S. military. It’s the people that sometimes deploy abroad, sometimes are used for disaster relief, for support at the border, things like that, lawful activities by militias that are authorized by the government. That is what a real militia is. Anything else we’re talking about here, whether these private groups of people that get together, that is an unlawful militia, an unlawful paramilitary. And as Josh was indicating, they will say, we stand as a bulwark against a tyrannical federal government or a tyrannical state government and try to claim that was sort of baked into the history of our country and our constitution. But that’s where they’re just so wrong. They’re so wrong historically and textually based on the constitution itself and based on law. So the three points to kick us off of this segment is there is no federal or state authorization for private individuals to group together and form their own militia under their own command. Well-regulated is always meant regulated by the government even since before the founding. Second point, the Second Amendment doesn’t protect them. The Supreme Court has been clear since 1886 in a case called Presser v. Illinois. They upheld anti-militia laws saying these do not violate people’s right to assembly under the First Amendment. They don’t violate people’s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. At that time, the right to bear arms was never imagined to include the right to bear arms for self-defense. That didn’t happen until 2008 when the Supreme Court decided a case called District of Columbia versus Heller, the first case ever to say individuals can bear arms for self-defense, but even in Heller, the court in a decision written by Justice Scalia said, that has nothing to do with paramilitary activity, reaffirmed as holding in press that the Second Amendment does not prevent states from prohibiting private paramilitary groups. And third point is all states, all 50, have either constitutional provisions or state laws that make it clear this is not lawful. The Constitution states -- say that militia shall always be under the control of the government, and other criminal statutes prohibit paramilitary activity, training, and militia activity. So that leads to Andrew’s question. How come there’s so little enforcement? How come they seem to be able to be out there doing their thing in public, heavily armed, often with AR-15s and other assault-style rifles, when this really is not authorized activity? Andrew Weissmann: And also, I would say, what does it mean to be a militia? In other words, we know that you can lawfully own a gun under various circumstances, and obviously there’s a right of assembly. So where is the line between sort of the right of assembly and the right of owning a gun and state laws, whether it’s statutory or constitutional state laws that say you can’t be a militia? Josh Kaplan: I mean, I am the last person to lecture the two of you on constitutional law. My sense from the national security officials I’ve spoken to is one, there’s a hesitancy around what they see as potential either constitutional questions around the First Amendment or simply political backlash that they could receive from Republican politicians if they are going after people who haven’t committed other crimes such as plotting to bomb a mosque. Secondly, I think there is a fear in the FBI that really cracking down on these groups could backfire. And whether or not that’s the right view, I don’t know. But you know, the modern movement was really sparked in the ‘90s by these extremely well-publicized standoffs at Ruby Ridge and at Waco that meant to be law enforcement actions, but as a result, kind of mobilized, really sparked this movement. And I mean, in terms of the sort of activities they do, I mean, just to illustrate the ways that this is different than being in a gun club. I mean, the training is remarkable to watch videos of. It’s a lot of getting together with semi-automatic rifles and practicing storming into a building. Sometimes doing that in pitch black with night vision goggles on. Mary McCord: Which just to be clear is not defensive tactics, right? That is very much an offensive military maneuver. Josh Kaplan: Absolutely. Absolutely. And these are often taught by military veterans who learned it while they were in the armed forces. And so close quarters gun combat indoors, that’s another thing they learn a lot. Using a sniper rifle to hit a target from half a mile away, which is, that’s a tough shot. I think the assassination attempt on Trump was about 150 yards. Mary McCord: Much closer. Josh Kaplan: That’s much, much closer. Mary McCord: Yes, much, much closer. Josh Kaplan: Then there’s the actual activities that they do in the real world, which kind of the standard things are these armed vigilante operations, which the group I was looking at, and I think this is a case for other groups, that’s going to the border and rounding up migrants in these vigilante patrols that the border patrol says is unlawful, although border patrol agents sometimes collaborate with militias that are down there. Similarly, at ballot boxes, trying to crack down on people casting absentee ballots, and during Black Lives Matter protests. Andrew Weissmann: Josh, that might be a really good place because you started to mention at least the makeup of these groups. It might be useful to talk about who are you seeing in these groups and something that you talk about in really superb piece is how they try to infiltrate, recruit people in law enforcement, not just former military or former law enforcement, but actually people who are currently in law enforcement and also the same question and issue with respect to politicians. Josh Kaplan: Yeah, I mean, so there are a lot of veterans, there are a lot of former law enforcement, and I do think the ranks of this group are a little wider than someone might expect for a bunch of people out in the woods. It’s a lot of active duty law enforcement working alongside convicted criminals. It’s people who have successful businesses, active duty military, people that work in the medical field. And really, as you said, I mean, this is viewed as an absolutely crucial goal for them to build alliances with active duty law enforcement for, among other reasons, because these are people that put themselves in extremely volatile situations with guns and they want the cops on their side. They want the cops to see them as friends and there are other reasons to that too. But they have a wide variety of tactics, some of which are like business school-esque marketing schemes. You know, they have these brochures that say in all caps with like five exclamation points, we are not a militia. And they give those to police officers. Internally, the leader of this group said, of course, that’s not true. We all know better. We’re a militia. But this was viewed as a branding decision that might make it so that a cop might feel more comfortable joining or supporting the group. Mary McCord: And wouldn’t you say also a financial because like you showed in your story, and I’ve seen this elsewhere, there’s fundraising online. And so that branding as we are about disaster preparedness and doing food drives and all of these things to sort of normalize their activity, try to fundraise on it, but like you say, the sub rosa, not even that, sub roses, for a militia doing close combat, you know, assault training. Josh Kaplan: Absolutely, and it helps bring in more people. And it’s a helpful line if a police officer in the group gets in trouble, to be able to say, no, that’s not what we do, we do this and this and that. And these are all true. They do these other things. They do do charity drives, but they’re very cognizant and at a certain level, once you get into the chats that are just the leaders, they’re very explicit. Like these are very, very useful things for us to do. Andrew Weissmann: Josh, you’ve talked about Facebook and you’ve talked about their ways of communicating. And I know that there was some effort by social media to sort of crack down on this, but if you could talk about how are they communicating? Josh Kaplan: Yeah, I mean, so a lot of their communications these days are on secure messaging apps. So either Telegram or Signal, which is an encrypted messaging service, which is, you know, it’s less on the open. All these chats that I’m referencing in this story were open only to vetted members of the militia or a lot of the chats were also just for the high level leaders of the militia. I mean, Facebook is a pivotal -- Mary McCord: Yes. Josh Kaplan: -- piece of this whole puzzle. I mean, it was fascinating for me reading these chats that, you know, as scared as they were about the FBI taking the shock and awe approach to arresting people who were participating in the Capitol riot. Really, I think they were more afraid of Facebook. Facebook cracked down on militias at that time, and that was their core recruiting tool. And it wasn’t just that this was just an online group. They then bring people into the real world through Facebook. But that was, as their leader described it, their greatest weapon. And Facebook’s policy hasn’t changed. The group I’m looking at is still, ever since January 6th has been on their list of banned dangerous organizations. But starting in fall 2021, just a few months really after January 6th, they start celebrating that they can recruit on Facebook again and that Facebook, as far as they can tell, has relaxed its controls. And so before long, they were bringing in so many new members that they were really struggling to keep up, as many as 50 new people a day, which does not take very long to become a real force. Andrew Weissmann: When you’re talking about social media just reminds me and its power and its utility in terms of recruiting and fomenting. I mean, that triggered me. Mary McCord: Oh, here we go. Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: With respect to what we were looking at in the Mueller investigation and the use of foreign actors of social media, particularly Facebook, and it’s way too long a topic for this podcast actually. But to me, it is so interesting to see the ways it’s now been used domestically when my first encounter with it was with respect to foreign actors operating here. Mary McCord: I think that’s one of the big lessons from January 6 too when you say, Josh, that before that and before all of the criminal prosecutions, a lot of these groups, if they hadn’t been banned by Facebook, they were operating either on Facebook or in other publicly accessible forums. And then, like you said this earlier, they went kind of more underground after January 6 and started actually having some operational security. And so it’s made your job of course, harder. It’s made law enforcement job harder and everyone because when you’re using end to end encrypted apps and things like that, the planning is not as out in the open as it was. As we wrap up, I really do want to focus on what we’ve got coming up here because your piece highlighted things that many of us paid attention to, but not everybody was aware of that happened during the midterms, which was an early thwarted, but otherwise supposed to be a nationwide effort to really have armed individuals out surveilling ballot drop boxes, voting centers, polling places, et cetera. And because of some early crackdowns, that didn’t really take off. But are you, number one, expecting to see a resurgence of that activity before and on election day this year? And two, what are you thinking about post-election? There’s one other thing I wanna say because there’s another group I work with a lot, Bridging Divides Initiative, and I think you’ve probably talked to them as well, and the Armed Conflict Location Event Dataset, which draws actual activity from the world world, not social media, into trends. And we have seen in this last year, there has been a pretty significant decrease in sort of out of public armed militia activity. But I don’t know about you, but I am worried that could very well end as we get closer to the election and post-election, regardless of who wins. But I’d like your take on that. Josh Kaplan: Yeah. I mean, it’s hard to predict exactly what form it will take, what will happen in this election, certainly. But I mean, when you look at the midterms, I mean, the conspiracy theories promoted by Trump around this they’re like catnip to militia because it’s this idea that elections are being stolen, our country is in mortal peril, and the authorities are either asleep at the wheel or are complicit. And that’s exactly the sort of rubric where they decide we’re going to step in and do this ourselves through vigilante operations. And as you said, in the midterms, this group, they’re very explicit. We’re going to stake out these ballot boxes and we’re going to intimidate people who are dropping off ballots that we think are committing fraud. Could that happen again? I mean, I think absolutely. This is becoming more of a commonplace thing in contemporary elections. And then it’s the aftermath of the election where things I think could get a lot dicier. And I think journalists are notoriously bad at predictions. But I think the most important takeaway here is that we’re still too early to know, is January 6 going to be the peak? Is January 6 going to be this kind of high watermark for militia violence? Are we going to look back on it as a prelude to something even more consequential, to some uptick? And there’s a lot of ways this could go. If Trump loses, this disappointment, a lot of experts I’ve spoken to or government officials I’ve spoken to are worried that that could spark violence either in the immediate aftermath of the election, if Trump again refuses to accept the results, or down the line throughout this administration because these things have often historically these cycles of violence have hinged on presidential election results. And then even if Trump wins, he’s promised he’s going to pardon the January 6 rioters. I think he recently said, oh yeah, I might pardon the ones who assaulted police officers too. And that, people I’ve spoken to are afraid that that could amount to a kind of political hunting license, like get out of jail free card for doing violence for the cause. Even if that’s not what he means, there’s a lot of people with a lot of guns who could interpret it that way. Andrew Weissmann: I have to say the reason that we thought this was such an important topic tied to what we typically do, which is cover primarily the criminal cases against Donald Trump, is that this is because of the concern this is a precursor. We’ve talked a lot about Georgia. We’ve talked a lot about the D.C. criminal cases and that is looking backwards to what happened. That’s what criminal cases are. There’s criminal responsibility for something that happened in the past. But your reporting and the incredible work that Mary does at ICAP is really looking at this forward-looking and thinking about this going forward. I’m going to say something, my last comment on this, which is not optimistic, is when I think about my time in law enforcement, I would read your article and presumably would know a lot of information in addition to that from a whole variety of sources. But human intelligence and electronic intelligence to try to anticipate what is coming up, but the FBI did such a horrendous job in anticipating January 6th, in spite of clear warning signs that I am just very concerned because the leadership of the FBI is the same. There is a different administration at the Department of Justice, but the FBI needs to have a very different attitude to its mission here to make sure that there isn’t a repeat of January 6th because as Mary outlined, what we’re seeing is conduct that does form at the very least a criminal conspiracy. And as Josh, you’ve talked about some activity when you talked about what they actually are not just talking about doing, but actually doing at the border, for instance, those are real criminal actions. And so in addition to being on the radar screen for law enforcement, there has to be a very different mindset at the FBI if we’re not going to see a repeat and we’re not going to have Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, after the facts talking to the public saying, gee, we could use your help in identifying people who committed a crime right outside our backyard. Josh Kaplan: Yeah. The FBI has historically in recent years done a very good job at stopping small sets of people with specific -- Mary McCord: Yes. Josh Kaplan: -- terrorist plots. Mary McCord: Plots, yes. Josh Kaplan: And January 6th, you know, militias were at the forefront of that, according to the Department of Justice. They were leading the charge at every major breach of the Capitol’s defenses. But their plans were, they were inchoate, they were haphazard. This was not a master plan that they perfectly executed, but they played a pivotal role. And that sort of, how do we predict that especially if we get the sort of inflection point and the sort of mass mobilization that a figure like Trump can create very quickly if he issues something that people interpret as a call to arms again, that hasn’t been tested since January 6th really, the law enforcement’s capacity to prepare for and respond to that. Mary McCord: Well, I think that’s all the more reason for you to do the writing and reporting you’re doing, Josh, and us to keep talking about it as well. And, you know, people need to know it’s not lawful. There actually have been some prosecutions at the border of militias there that had no authority and were, you know, detaining migrants unlawfully. But it’s too few and far between and I agree law enforcement needs to be way more proactive this time around to protect everyone’s public safety. But I don’t want anyone to feel like they cannot safely go to the polls or go to ballot drop boxes because there has been so much work done over the last four years to try to make sure that people can safely vote. And that includes what we saw the thwarting of that plan to have surveillance across the country before the midterms. We saw DOJ get involved in one of those cases. So I’m going to do something I don’t always do and end with my glass half full instead of my glass half empty. We’re smarter now and we know more and let’s hope that helps. Josh, it’s been absolutely wonderful having you on. Really, really admire your reporting not only on this, but obviously on many other topics that are very, very important to us, and maybe we’ll be able to have you back sometime. Maybe we’ll be celebrating post-election that none of this came to pass. Andrew Weissmann: Josh, thank you again so much and thank you to “ProPublica.” I really feel like it is having such a moment and such an impact on all of our thinking. And it’s just remarkable, the work that you have done. I mean, talk about punching way above its weight in terms of breaking truly important stories for people to know and follow. Josh Kaplan: Thank you so much. We really appreciate it and really appreciate you having me on. Mary McCord: Thanks so much to Josh Kaplan, a reporter at “ProPublica” since 2020. His piece is called “Armed and Underground: Inside the Turbulent Secret World of an American Militia.” And we’ll post a link to that in our show notes. Andrew Weissmann: Quick note for our loyal listeners, we usually record on Tuesdays, but next week we are going to record on Wednesday because we’re expecting a joint filing in the D.C. case before Judge Chutkan that is coming on Tuesday and could be filed anytime up to midnight that night. So we are gonna record first thing Wednesday so that we can cover what’s in that filing and give you our thoughts on that. Thanks for listening.

Abortion is on the ballot in Arizona after state court ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/abortion-arizona-ballot-court-approves-rcna167534,"Abortion rights will be on the ballot in Arizona this fall after the state supreme court unanimously rejected a challenge that sought to keep voters from deciding whether to enshrine a fundamental right to abortion in the battleground state. Arizona’s top court emphasized that it wasn’t opining on the morality of abortion but rather whether the initiative could appear on the ballot. Arizona Right to Life argued that the description of the measure used to collect signatures to put it on the ballot was so misleading as to invalidate it. The state court rejected that argument in an opinion on Tuesday. The court noted that the measure’s principal provisions are (1) establishing a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution; (2) the scope of that right, before and after fetal viability; and (3) the preclusion of the state from penalizing a person for assisting another in exercising that right. The court said the description wasn’t objectively false or misleading and that it “explains each of these provisions and the tests that would apply to restrictions upon that right.”  The court said the description wasn’t required to explain the initiative’s impact on existing abortion laws or regulations. Noting that state law currently prohibits elective abortions after 15 weeks, the court said that “a reasonable person would necessarily understand that existing laws that fail the prescribed tests would be invalid rather than continue in effect.”  The anti-abortion challengers also argued that the initiative itself is misleading, but the court said that wasn’t the issue in this appeal and that the proper place to argue about that is in the political arena. According to Arizona for Abortion Access, which backed the proposed Arizona Abortion Access Act, or Proposition 139, making abortion a fundamental right would mean that the state can’t limit abortion access before fetal viability without establishing that the limitation (1) is solely to protect the health of the patient, (2) doesn’t infringe on their autonomous decision-making, and (3) uses only the least restrictive means. It further says that the act protects abortion access after fetal viability if a treating healthcare provider determines an abortion is needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the patient, using accepted clinical standards and evidence-based medicine. The state ruling comes as the U.S. Supreme Court, which eliminated federal abortion rights in 2022, is considering an emergency appeal from Republicans to enforce an Arizona law requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote. The justices could act on that appeal anytime.  Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Trump seems to think he has an airtight defense for visiting a KKK hotbed in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:04 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-howell-michigan-kkk-white-supremacists-rcna167460,"Donald Trump’s appearance in Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday sparked controversy before he even arrived. That’s because the visit continued his notable tradition of scheduling campaign stops in locations known as hotbeds for racist extremism. Just last month, a group of white supremacists marched in Howell and expressed their support for Trump and Adolf Hitler. As journalist Jon King wrote for the Michigan Advance, the event evoked memories of Howell’s racist — and in some cases, fairly recent — history of public bigotry and the Ku Klux Klan. So this was certainly a peculiar location for Trump to host a rally — especially when you consider that he has said nothing about the white supremacist gathering there in July and that he has a history of similar scheduling controversies. Last year, for example, he held a rally in Waco, Texas, shortly after the 30th anniversary of the deadly standoff between Branch Davidians (aka cultists) and law enforcement. Trump’s speech at that rally, in which he vowed “I am your retribution,” definitely gave off David Koresh vibes. And in 2020, Trump reversed course and rescheduled a planned Juneteenth rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where in 1921 white mobs waged one of the deadliest race riots in history — killing as many as 300 Black people. As a matter of fact, Trump is set to speak Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, where members of a pro-Trump chapter of the KKK sought to hold a cross-burning in 2017. But Trump seems to think he found an airtight defense for his Michigan visit. When a reporter on Tuesday asked about his response to criticism over his visit, he responded with a question of his own: “Who was here in 2021?” The answer he was fishing for — and received — was “Joe Biden.” Of course, the big difference is that the president wasn’t visiting right after racists praised him and Hitler simultaneously. In a statement, the Harris-Walz campaign slammed Trump for his refusal “to condemn the white supremacists who marched in his name.” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat whose district includes Howell, was critical as well, writing on X that Trump “didn’t come to Howell today to bring people together, to call out that hateful behavior, or to offer any kind of hopeful vision for the future.” She said the visit “risks reopening old wounds” and added: “Real leaders should take the opportunity to condemn the hatred that has been on display.” I’ll note that one simple way for Trump to dissociate from the racists in Howell might have been for him to avoid doing anything that suggests he shares the same bigoted ideology. But unfortunately for him, at one point Tuesday he seemed to openly fantasize about deploying the police at election time, harkening back to periods of unfettered displays of white supremacy in the U.S. Methinks the Howell visit might not be entirely coincidental."
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.21.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-82124-rcna167568,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Florida, former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell easily won her Democratic U.S. Senate primary this week, setting up a potentially interesting contest against far-right Sen. Rick Scott. The Republican incumbent also faced nominal primary opposition, which posed little challenge. * Speaking of the Sunshine State, Politico reported that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ attempt to elect conservative school board members across Florida hit a snag this week, “as candidates backed by the Republican governor fell in several key races.” * Montana’s secretary of state has now certified an abortion rights ballot measure, putting the issue on the state’s November ballot. In addition to the obvious medical and legal implications, the development might also have a broader electoral impact: Montana is home to a closely watched U.S. Senate race, and the more reproductive rights proponents vote in the fall, the better it will probably be for incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. * NBC News reported that the first night of the Democratic National Convention drew an estimated 20 million viewers, which exceeds the 18 million viewers who watched the first night of last month’s Republican National Convention. * The Washington Post reported that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and the Democratic National Committee “raised three times as much as Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee in July, and ended the month with a cash advantage that positions the newly minted Democratic presidential nominee to air more ads and maintain a larger payroll than her Republican opponent in the final months of the race for the White House.” * Though we haven’t heard much lately about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his considerable wealth, Bloomberg appears to have cut a $10 million check for the House Democrats’ largest super PAC. * And there’s reason anew to wonder about the future of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign: The conspiracy theorist’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said their campaign faces a choice between continuing with its ill-fated effort — which would “risk” helping Harris — or dropping out to “join forces” with Trump. The candid comments, made on a podcast, left little doubt that the Kennedy candidacy is intended to undermine the Democratic ticket."
Republican voices make a splash at the Democratic convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 8:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-voices-make-splash-democratic-convention-rcna167558,"By any fair measure, the number of Republicans and conservative figures who’ve endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris is an incredible symbolic victory for the Democratic ticket. Harris and her allies are eager to reach voters beyond their party’s base, and the more support the vice president picks up from the other side of the partisan divide, the better it’ll be for her candidacy. But as the Democratic National Convention is making clear, Democrats are doing more than just thinking about the symbolism, and Team Harris isn’t just relegating her Republican proponents to names on a page. On the contrary, as NBC News reported, some prominent GOP voices were invited onto the convention stage. “I saw him when the cameras were off, behind closed doors. Trump mocks his supporters. He calls them basement dwellers,” she said. Grisham went on to share an anecdote about a Trump visit to a hospital during the Covid crisis. “He was mad that the cameras were not watching him. He has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,” she said. “He used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’ But it does matter — what you say matters, and what you don’t say matters.” The comments were striking, but so too were the broader circumstances: Trump’s former White House press secretary addressed the Democratic National Convention, urging voters to elect Trump’s Democratic rival. To put this in perspective, imagine Karine Jean-Pierre getting a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in 2028. What’s more, Grisham wasn’t alone. Four Republicans addressed the Democratic convention on its second night, including Mesa Mayor John Giles and Ana Navarro, a Republican co-host of the “The View”; and former Rep. Adam Kinzinger is still scheduled to appear this week. If there are some on-the-fence GOP voters who aren’t quite sold on their party’s scandal-plagued nominee (Nikki Haley voters, I’m looking in your direction), Harris and her party are clearly extending an outreached hand."
"Reality gets in the way of Trump’s line on crime, law enforcement",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 7:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/reality-gets-way-trumps-line-crime-law-enforcement-rcna167545,"Donald Trump and his campaign team apparently had a simple plan: The former president would go to Michigan and talk about crime, which is an issue the Republican sees as electoral strength, despite his criminal record. The trouble, of course, is that reality got in the way of the pitch. The Trump campaign, for example, had told The Detroit News that the GOP candidate would agree to an interview, but as the newspaper reported, after the News “began asking about the Michigan crime data before the event, a campaign aide said the presidential candidate no longer had time for an interview.” Imagine that. Trump declared in Michigan that there’s an ongoing “crime wave” that’s reached levels “nobody has ever seen before.” He was, of course, lying: Though crime rates spiked toward the end of his failed presidency, the United States has seen a dramatic turnaround in recent years. When Team Trump came to realize that the Detroit News might ask the former president to contend with the truth, a scheduled interview opportunity quickly disappeared. The Republican clearly preferred to bask in his alternate reality. In big cities “almost all run by Democrats,” Trump added, “you can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot. You get mugged. You get raped. You get whatever it may be.” This was demonstrably ridiculous. Trump obviously didn’t care — and it wasn’t the only lie he peddled during the event. But stepping back, the larger point of the event was apparently to position the GOP candidate as an ally of law enforcement. Indeed, Trump spoke at the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office surrounded by deputies in uniform, in front of parked police SUVs. After the remarks, he posted an item to his social media platform with the words “BACK THE BLUE” superimposed over his photograph. The point, obviously, was to suggest to voters that Trump is aligned with law enforcement. But just as actual crime rates get in the way of the former president’s campaign pitch, Trump’s record gets in the way of his alliance with the police. Consider the newly revised list of The Top 10 Reasons Donald Trump Deserves To Be Seen As An Opponent Of Law Enforcement. 10. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and accused law enforcement officials of pushing “fake” crime rate statistics as part of a political plot to help Democrats. 9. A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies, and he’s still facing dozens of other criminal counts across multiple jurisdictions. 8. Trump is facing civil suits from police officers who sustained injuries during the Jan. 6 riot the Republican instigated. 7. Trump has condemned common law enforcement tools, including plea agreements for witnesses who cooperate with prosecutors. 6. Trump abused his powers by intervening in criminal cases in which the defendants were political allies, letting politically connected suspects go free — even after some pleaded guilty — and undermining law enforcement in the process. 5. Trump has undermined law enforcement by abusing his pardon powers, in one case even commuting the sentence of a man accused of helping murder of a police officer. 4. Trump lashed out at the police officer who shot Ashli Babbitt as a “thug” and a “coward” who deserves to be vilified. 3. Trump has promised day-one pardons for insurrectionists, many of whom violently clashed with police officers. 2. While in office, Trump saw law enforcement as a political weapon he can wield at his convenience, which led him to urge law enforcement officials to enforce his political vendettas and help Republicans win elections. 1. Trump has expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a sycophantic supporter of the former president, recently declared via social media, “No one Backs The Blue more than President Trump.” There’s ample evidence to the contrary. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
This AI chief says being over 50 is her secret weapon. Here’s why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 6:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/ai-chief-says-50-secret-weapon-s-rcna167493,"It might seem like science fiction, but in the era of rapid AI development, the rise of “robotic co-workers” is real and projected to become a nearly $40 billion global market over the next decade. But humans, do not fear. At the helm of that industry — with a mission to separate fact from fiction — is Peggy Johnson, CEO of Agility Robotics. In March, she took over the Oregon-based startup that has raised $180 million in venture financing, according to Forbes. At 62, Johnson oversees the development of humanoid robots — machines that stand as tall as a person, have a head, two arms and two legs — engineered to maneuver freely and work alongside humans in warehouses to fulfill dull, repetitive tasks, like moving products onto conveyors. While the demand for this bipedal bot, called Digit, has skyrocketed in industrial manufacturing, the intent isn’t to displace human workers at all, but rather make them more productive. For her work in this brave new world of robotics and AI, Johnson was recently honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s 4th annual “50 Over 50” U.S. list this month, in the innovation category. The list celebrates women who have found success later in life and are shattering age and gender norms. As far as Johnson is concerned, her age is her greatest asset. “I have this plethora of experiences that one has built on the other, that’s built on the other, through several companies and I couldn’t have done that in a compacted amount of time,” Johnson told ForbesWomen editor, Maggie McGrath. “I had to live by the way through the highs and lows of different projects and different company cycles — all of that is cumulative to the experience I bring today in my current role — so it’s absolutely an advantage and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Johnson’s career in tech leadership began when she joined Microsoft in 2014 as Satya Nadella’s first hire. She made a name for herself as the company’s “chief dealmaker” when she spearheaded Microsoft’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. During the pandemic, she led augmented reality company Magic Leap. But there was a time when she never envisioned a career in the tech and engineering fields. That all changed in a single day over a fluke conversation she had in college. “I went off to San Diego State and … I had a [mail delivery] job on campus because I was putting myself through college,” she recalled to McGrath. “I walked into the engineering department one day to deliver mail and the two administrative assistants behind the desk thought I was there to learn about engineering. I said, ‘Nope, just here to deliver mail,’ and they said, ‘Well, do you know anything about engineering?’” That exchange sparked a bigger conversation. “I had no idea what an engineer did in their profession, and so they sat me down and walked me all through the different types of engineering that I could go into. At the end of the conversation, they pushed the papers across the table to change my major. So, that night I filled it out, came in the next day and became an engineering major.” With a newly-minted degree in electrical engineering, Johnson landed a job at San Diego tech company, Qualcomm, where she spent 25 years, eventually becoming the company’s executive vice president and head of global market development. When she later joined Microsoft as the executive vice president of Business Development, she cemented her reputation as one of the world’s most notable women in engineering. In fact, Business Insider lauded her as the “#1 Most Powerful Female Engineer"" in 2017. But that level of success didn’t come without its own set of challenges, especially as a woman in a highly male-dominated industry. “My biggest learning of my entire career was just to be myself because as I went on to my next job and did not have a female manager, I was oftentimes criticized during performance reviews for not speaking up enough in meetings,” she told Mcgrath. “It became a detriment to my upward mobility in these companies and I thought, well, maybe I’ll try and be that person they want me to be. I tried to be louder in meetings. One day I even hit my hand on the table and said, ‘I want to speak!’ and they looked at me startled, and said, ‘What’s wrong with Peggy?’” Johnson’s manager at the time stepped in. “I wasn’t myself for sure and then my manager said, ‘You know what, you just be yourself and that will carry us through.’ And he was right, that actually gave me the confidence to be the introvert that I was. I did communicate, but not always in a big meeting. I would go to someone’s office or I’d call them or send an email … I was getting my point across and he helped others recognize that.” Johnson credits her leadership style today to that authenticity, as well as her ability to hear other points of view — something she learned as a child growing up in a large family. “I’m one of 15 [and] being the second to the youngest … I was a big listener. And it was hard anyway to get a word in edgewise at our family dinner table,” she told McGrath. “And so I became a listener and that has been one of the areas that I was able to leverage in my management roles over the years and then my CEO roles.” Johnson herself has raised three children with her husband, Eric, who she met in the very same college engineering department that changed the course of her life four decades ago. Given the trajectory of her long career, Johnson had this advice for younger women who feel the rush to accomplish their career goals early on: “Don’t feel the need to do that.” “To make sure to sequence in all of those parts of your life — your work life, your partner, your children, your activities — all of those things are important to us as individuals and you can really abandon those if your only goal is getting ahead,” she told McGrath. “We all have to have that well-rounded part of our lives, because that makes us the person that we are, and if we’re ignoring those parts of our lives and just become the workaholic, I think it actually holds you back.”"
"As Gaetz wins Florida primary, McCarthy’s ‘revenge tour’ falters",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 6:38 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gaetz-wins-florida-primary-mccarthys-revenge-tour-falters-rcna167527,"After former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was stripped of his gavel, prompting the California Republican to ultimately resign from Congress, he put aside talk of a possible comeback bid. Rather, McCarthy’s short-term focus was on the 2024 election cycle and a plan to target the GOP members who were responsible for ending his career on Capitol Hill. The strategy quickly became known as the former House speaker’s “revenge tour.” It’s also become McCarthy’s latest failure. NBC News reported: As NBC News’ report added, a McCarthy-aligned super PAC invested $3.5 million on ads against Gaetz, emphasizing the incumbent congressman’s many scandals. It didn’t work: The latest vote tallies suggest Gaetz won his primary by roughly 45 points. This was not, in other words, a squeaker. McCarthy and his allies tried to bring down the former speaker’s intraparty bête noire, and they failed spectacularly. Making matters worse, it was the latest in a series of 2024 setbacks. McCarthy’s revenge tour targeted Rep. Nancy Mace in South Carolina, and she won her primary easily. McCarthy also targeted Rep. Eli Crane in Arizona, and he won his primary easily. As part of the same revenge tour, Team McCarthy eyed Rep. Tim Burchett in Tennessee, too, but that didn’t go anywhere. It’d be an overstatement to say the former speaker’s efforts were a complete flop — McCarthy and his allies targeted House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good in Virginia, and the incumbent narrowly lost in a GOP primary earlier in the summer — but it was the only stop on the revenge tour that went well. In each of the other contests, McCarthy and his political operation raised millions of dollars, only to come up empty. The Republican’s tenure as speaker was embarrassing, but it now appears that his second act wasn’t much better. As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones explained in June, “This ‘revenge tour’ by McCarthy was supposed to show his power as an independent force in Republican politics. So far, it’s shaping up to be a reflection of his weakness and political irrelevance.”"
"Barack, Michelle Obama cut Donald Trump down to size at DNC",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 5:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/barack-michelle-obama-cut-donald-trump-size-dnc-rcna167516,"When Democrats make a case against Donald Trump, they tend to focus on many of the former president’s worst qualities. The party and its officials eagerly remind voters that the Republican is dangerous and radical, dishonest and corrupt, ignorant and hateful. The assessments, of course, are rooted in fact. But one of the striking things about the respective Democratic National Convention speeches from Michelle and Barack Obama was their willingness to make a different kind of case against the GOP nominee: Trump, the Obamas effectively argued, is small and tiresome. From the former first lady’s remarks: Subtle, it was not. To be sure, both of the Obamas spent the bulk of their speeches touting the incumbent vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the Democratic ticket’s vision, but some of the most memorable parts of their remarks were their takedowns of the Republican candidate. “For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” the former first lady added. “See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black. I want to know, who’s going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs? “It’s his same old con. Doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better. “Look, because cutting our health care, taking away our freedom to control our bodies, the freedom to become a mother through I.V.F., like I did — those things are not going to improve the health outcomes of our wives, mothers and daughters. Shutting down the Department of Education, banning our books — none of that will prepare our kids for the future. Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love, look, that doesn’t make anybody’s life better. Instead, instead, it only makes us small. And let me tell you this: Going small is never the answer. Going small is the opposite of what we teach our kids. Going small is petty. It’s unhealthy. And quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.” If there was a time when Michelle Obama pulled her punches, that time has passed. Her husband’s assessment dovetailed nicely with hers. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago,” the former president said. “It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that’s actually been getting worse now that he is afraid of losing to Kamala. There’s the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. It just goes on and on and on. The other day, I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day.” When Obama referenced Trump’s weird obsession with crowd sizes, pay particular attention to what he did with his hands: “Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided: between us and them, between the real Americans who, of course, support him and the outsiders who don’t,” Obama added. “And he wants you to think that you’ll be richer and safer if you will just give him the power to put those other people back in their place. It is one of the oldest tricks in politics, from a guy whose act has — let’s face it — gotten pretty stale. We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.” As eviscerations go, the Obamas weren’t just pitch-perfect, they also delivered remarks that won’t soon be forgotten."
"Tim Walz was my favorite teacher. He’ll be an exceptional vice president, too.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-teacher-politics-kamala-harris-2024-election-rcna166464,"The country is taking a crash course to get to know Tim Walz. You may be learning about his record as governor of Minnesota in his second term. Maybe you recall his 12 years as a Democratic congressman representing a conservative district where he was ranked the 88th most bipartisan congressman and focused on veterans’ and farmers’ issues. Maybe you’re learning about his 24-year service to our country in the National Guard.  I’ve known Gov. Walz as Mr. Walz. I was fortunate to have Mr. Walz as my global geography teacher at Mankato West High School in 2005. I also have the distinction of being the last class Mr. Walz taught before switching careers and going to Washington, D.C. For those not familiar with Mankato, it’s a small farming community in southern Minnesota nestled in a river valley about 90 miles from St. Paul and Minneapolis. It’s also about 60 miles north of Iowa. We are known for being the soybean-crushing capital of the world, as well as for our stone products. Teachers and coaches play a significant role in our lives, and a great teacher can change the lives of students and athletes. Think of your favorite teacher or coach. What traits did they have? Likely they inspired you; they made you feel hope that tomorrow will be better than today, are invested in their students’ future, teach us how to overcome obstacles, help us see the potential within ourselves, and ultimately inspire us to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be. These are the traits that Mr. Walz embodies. Mr. Walz is the kind of person who brings joy to everything he does. The smiles and energy you see on the campaign trail are as real now as they were over 20 years ago in a high school classroom. Mr. Walz’s enthusiasm is contagious, making it hard not to pay attention when he speaks. He is kind, genuine and authentic — qualities that not only make him an excellent teacher but are also much needed in politics.  I wasn’t a top student in high school, but Mr. Walz treated me with the same dedication and effort he gave to my more successful classmates. This commitment inspired me. Mr. Walz also got us thinking about the world at large. We actively discussed issues such as the genocide in Cambodia and the Holocaust, and how Muslim women were treated in France after the government banned religious symbols from public schools in 2004. Once a week, Gov. Walz offered an extra credit assignment. Students would have to come prepared to discuss a recent news event for 30 to 60 seconds, and you couldn’t repeat a story another classmate had already used. This exercise made us realize just how big the world really is; suddenly the world moved beyond the walls of my Mankato classroom. Mr. Walz’s approach to the classroom made you want to be actively a part of the broader world. Almost a decade after graduating from Mankato West High School. I ran for a Duluth City Council seat, won and served six years. This is partly due to Mr. Walz; his service to our country through the National Guard and Congress, but also his dedication to my local community as a teacher and a high school football coach.  Mr. Walz made politics feel accessible. He made me believe that someone who doesn’t come from family money, isn’t Ivy League-educated and isn’t a lawyer, can still run for office, win and make a positive impact on your community and country. It’s not every day that your favorite high school teacher has the chance to be the next vice president of the United States; you would have to go back over 50 years to Lyndon Johnson.  I am incredibly proud of Mr. Walz, all he has accomplished, and how he has gone about accomplishing it: by being joyful, authentic, caring and genuine in all that he does."
Tim Walz once asked me an important question. It changed the course of my life.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-teacher-writer-harris-2024-election-rcna166815,"We need people in the White House who are curious about other points of view. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is one of those people. In the late 1990s, Mr. Walz was my global geography teacher at Mankato West High School in Minnesota. I’ll never forget sitting in his class as he passionately delivered his lesson of the day. Mr. Walz didn’t simply stand at the front of the room and talk at his students. He gestured. He paced. He asked us questions. Our high school didn’t have air conditioning, and you knew it had been a lively class when sweat lined Mr. Walz’s brow by the time the bell rang. The guy never stopped moving. He made us excited to learn about the world beyond our small town. Mr. Walz shared many of his experiences with us, from growing up in Nebraska to serving in the National Guard. (I recall the day he explained why he often spoke so loudly. He had some hearing loss from his time in the Guard.) Before coming to Minnesota, Mr. Walz had spent time teaching in China. He shared his experiences there and even taught us a bit of Pinyin, the Chinese phonetic system that uses the Latin alphabet. During one particularly memorable class, Mr. Walz and another student were quietly arguing at the front of the room. The argument escalated until the student shoved his desk. Mr. Walz sent the student to the principal’s office. The rest of us sat in silent shock — until the student came back into class with a grin on his face. Mr. Walz admitted they had staged the whole “argument.” He then asked each of us to write an account of what had happened. We all remembered the incident slightly differently. He taught us a valuable and powerful lesson on perspective, memory and eyewitness testimony. But it wasn’t the most powerful lesson I learned from Mr. Walz. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to be a writer. Junior year, I signed up for the creative writing class. During the poetry unit, each of us wrote a poem on a giant sheet of paper and hung it in the second-floor hallway. My poem was about shyness. Those who knew me back then wouldn’t be surprised by my choice of subject. I was shy and quiet yet bursting with ideas and opinions. But I was often too afraid to voice them. Writing was a natural outlet for me. (It still is.) After I hung up my poem, I decided it wasn’t quite finished. I grabbed a marker and added a stand-alone line along the bottom that read: “Sometimes people who don’t speak have the most to say.” A few students complimented my poem. A senior on the basketball team even said it was her friend’s new favorite poem. As a young writer, receiving that positive feedback was thrilling. One day, I was at my locker when Mr. Walz approached me. He had read my poem and was curious about the final line I had added. “Is that true?” he asked me. “About people who don’t talk much having a lot to say?” Mr. Walz was one of the most popular teachers at school. He was outgoing and friendly to everyone. And he seemed genuinely interested in a point of view I don’t think he’d given a lot of thought to until he read my words. Perhaps he also knew I needed someone to acknowledge that quiet students have value, too. Mr. Walz was the only teacher at school who asked me about my poem. We had a good chat, and his interest in my perspective stuck with me long after I graduated. Over the years, I’ve had a handful of teachers who encouraged me to keep writing, in ways big and small. Mr. Walz was one of those teachers. Character and curiosity matter. They matter at home, at school, in our communities, and in our government. Tim Walz has these qualities in spades."
Tim Walz embodies the Midwestern values that conservatives never talk about,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/celebrate-tim-walz-midwestern-dad-memes-rcna167422,"I like to joke that I’ve only ever lived in the colon of the country. From Texas to South Dakota to Minnesota, now Iowa — the states where people say they are from but rarely ever move to. When I tell people where I live, after getting Iowa confused with Ohio, they ask me why I don’t just move. Why don’t I leave? Why don’t I get the hell out where I could maybe get some reproductive rights? What about my kids? People used to be able to say that Iowa was a good place to raise kids. But with my state’s disinvestment from public schools, the book bans and attacks on trans kids, you can’t say that anymore. The people who love it here tell me to leave, too, because I’ve made a career of writing about the problems with this state. In picking Tim Walz as her running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris seems to be sending a message to flyover places: that we aren’t forgotten.  Walz is a man who exudes an authentic Midwestern ethos. His rounded vowels and softened consonants are not a put on. Unlike the thousands of politicians who come to the Midwest to talk agriculture policy, roll up flannel sleeves, stand in front of a hay bale for a picture and then get the hell out, Walz is from places people write off. Having grown up in Nebraska, Walz moved to rural Minnesota and worked as a teacher at Mankato West High School. His wife, Gwen, and I attended the same small rural college that no one outside the twin cities or Lutheran Church culture has ever heard of. Walz is the Midwestern dad of memes. Slapping his thighs and saying “whelp,” wearing camo not because he’s cosplaying, but because he actually likes to hunt. And it’s important that he is  Midwestern, because like being middle class, being Midwestern is a self-designated identity marker of normalcy. This land is the middle of two coasts, pulled in between the perceived extremes, and it’s become a metaphor for American values.  The Midwest has many competing identities: First Nations, white settlers, the waves of immigrants who found a home here. And sometimes when someone will say something like, “Oh, Chicago is not Midwestern,” what they really mean is that it’s too diverse to fit their definition of the whiteness of this place.  But if definitions can exclude, they can also include. This land is a closed fist sometimes, but it can also be an open hand.  Walz’s history as governor is not one of exclusion; it’s one of openness, welcome and inclusivity. Walz’s entire identity is what we think of when we think of the average American, but his politics are radically inclusive. And, as such, he offers a different vision of what this country can be. His policies, which include giving kids free school lunch and offering paid parental leave, being vehemently pro-reproductive rights and LGBTQ reflect, not the bitter-chip-on-the-shoulder-own-the-libs politics that the Midwest has been defined by during the Trump era, but a generous and expansive political vision that harkens back to Paul Wellstone, Tom Harkin and Tom Daschle. Pundits like to write off this region, but recent progressive wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas show that this land is more complicated than it looks when you simply fly over it or look at it on an electoral map. Walz himself has decried the reductivist thinking of red state/blue state maps, in 2023 noting, “We need to find the first person who put that red-blue map up and beat the hell out of them for putting that on, because it divided the country.” He is right. The value of a land should not be decided on its politics. Right after an inland hurricane tore through my town and people were struggling for help, a common refrain on social media was, “That’s what you get for voting for Republicans.” As if the accidents of birth geography, and the intentional segregation of gerrymandering and voter suppression, meant people should suffer. I saw people saying similarly dismissive things after the energy crisis in Texas, and people will be saying it as Floridians suffer in the wake of its most recent hurricane. It’s a cruel calculation. One that equates politics with virtue and virtue with worthiness. But the reality is people need help simply because they are people. And if this election is about who gets to define this country and who gets to be defined, picking Walz makes sense. He’s an older white man and he is out there calling Trump and Vance “weird” — aberrations from the norm — and that critique means something coming from him, a white male governor from a Midwestern state. A region so often mocked for its blandness that the blandness, like the Miracle Whip in the potato salads, becomes a binding agent — a cohesiveness we very much need in the vastness and complexity of America.

Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-howell-michigan-speech-crime-rcna167365,"Former President Donald Trump stood before the media on Tuesday afternoon to lie about crime. This isn’t the first time he has fabricated fictions about violent immigrants streaming across the border or cities under an onslaught of criminally violent minorities, crumbling pillars of the Republican case against Vice President Kamala Harris. But it was the setting, outside the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office in Howell, Michigan, that infused his rambling with an even darker undertone than normal. I don’t remember when I first learned about Howell’s association with the Ku Klux Klan. I’m not a native of Michigan; my family moved there the year I turned 12. But by the time I was in college, it was a readily understood “joke” among my friends that there’d be no stopping for gas in Howell if I was in the car. I would stare at the signage on the interstate as we’d cruise past, grateful the tank was nowhere near empty. In the 1970s and ’80s, at the peak of the city’s links to the white supremacist movement, Robert Miles, the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, had a Howell mailing address and was known to hold rallies on a nearby farm property. Black residents of nearby Detroit knew full well not to set foot in the town, a belief that — if it hasn’t expired — lasted at minimum deep into the early 2000s. The city has worked hard to shake that association with hate movements, a project that was damaged last month during a previous Trump visit to Michigan. Though the campaign rally held that day was across the state in Grand Rapids, a small group of masked white supremacists marched through downtown Howell chanting “Heil Hitler.” Later that day, another demonstration was held on a highway overpass, featuring a swastika flag and people chanting, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” I want to stress that this was only a dozen or so racists and that the city’s officials don’t support the hatefulness that was displayed. “Although we recognize their right to free speech, these demonstrators do not reflect the values of the Howell community,” the city said in a statement at the time. But it’s not a stretch to say that the men who gathered that day knew the significance of the location they’d picked. Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy tried to de-emphasize the matter in a Facebook post ahead of Trump’s visit. “Within the last month, there’s been a couple of folks that have come here to cause a little bit of a stir, spew some hate speech, white supremacy crap,” he said in the video. He also denied that Trump’s appearance was meant to be a political event, calling it a “press conference,” instead. Notably, though, Trump didn’t take a single question from the assembled reporters after delivering his remarks, which sounded like his usual stump speech sprinkled with a few dodgy statistics. I’ve been unable to figure out whose figures he was supposedly citing when he claimed that crime had spiked since Vice President Kamala Harris took office. In reality, we’ve seen major declines in violent crime since a peak in 2020, both across the country and especially in Detroit. But the supposed statistics he was offering were less important than the rhetoric surrounding them. This was an audience that Trump wanted to hear this particular diatribe. Like his presidency, Trump’s presidential campaigns have always been in a constant state of dissonance between a claimed respect for law and order and a flagrant flouting of the rule of law. He has been quick to sidle up to the police and stoke their belief that any mention of accountability is a grave attack upon them. In speaking with Murphy and several deputies standing behind him, Trump clearly sought to project strength to a sympathetic audience who would accept his entirely vibes-based argument that there’s a “Kamala crime wave.” The thing is, though, that’s a point that Trump could have made standing in front of SUVs emblazoned with a sheriff’s logo in any small town in any swing state in the country. Howell’s history, both long-term and recent, sets it apart. The same could be easily said about Trump’s decision to hold a rally in Waco, Texas, to defend the Jan. 6 rioters. It was likewise similar to presidential candidate Ronald Reagan’s choice in 1980 to give a speech about state’s rights at the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi. Neshoba is the county where civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney had been kidnapped and murdered 16 years earlier. Reagan made the deliberate choice to speak there to win over lingering segregationists in the state. There is no world in which Trump’s team didn’t understand the significance of holding that event in Howell. That he did so is to the great detriment of the people who have worked to show they now outnumber the cowards who chanted antisemitic comments and expressed support for Trump from behind masks last month. Howell is not the place it was in the 1970s and ’80s — but as we saw last month, there are people who hope that it can be again if Trump is returned to leadership. They chanted, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” Trump hasn’t even condemned them."
Michelle Obama understands the stakes in November. And she’s done pulling punches.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 9:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/michelle-obama-dnc-speech-democratic-convention-rcna167484,"The woman who so many people wanted to draft to run for president — the author and speaker who enchanted a whole generation of women and helped us understand where we belong in modern society — began her speech Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention talking about feelings.  Former first lady Michelle Obama spoke of the magical feeling in the air, the power of grief and the sense that as a country we can be better than what we have been.  Michelle talked us through the national trauma we experienced under former President Donald Trump — “the dimming of our light” and how Trump’s continued pursuit of power gives a “palpable sense of dread about our future.” And then she reminded us that hope is still alive. Sitting in the convention audience once again, Michelle spoke to me more personally. Eight years ago, I was massively pregnant with my first child and optimistic that women were going to shatter the thickest glass ceiling of all. We have all experienced a lot of life since the moment when the former first lady reminded us that “when they go low, we go high.”  One global pandemic, a domestic insurrection and dozens of personal crises later, Michelle spoke to women across the country to remind us of the power we share, a power rooted in our connections to one another.  It isn’t “enough for our kids to thrive while everyone is drowning,” she said, and I am reminded of the father who turned back in the roiling Rio Grande to try to rescue his 2-year old daughter, only for them both to drown. Kids in cages and stories of children dying in the Middle East are no longer policy problems to wrangle; I am now more than a diplomat and policy wonk — I am a woman and a mother who sees my hopes and dreams in other people, too. Michelle reminded us that Vice President Kamala Harris’ story is “my story, our story,” and she’s right. Our mothers — mine in Pakistan, Michelle’s in Chicago, Kamala’s in India — vast oceans and cultures apart — had been single-minded in telling their daughters to “do something” and lift up the people around us. Michelle gave us a way to heal and laugh, not by going low but by going in hard, using Trump’s insecurities and insults against him, reminding everyone that before Trump was in the White House, the presidency was, indeed, “one of those Black jobs.” She called out Trump for trying the “same old con” of racism and misogyny and noted how the rest of us don’t have the benefit of generational wealth and skating around multiple bankruptcies.  And Michelle gave all of us who have been heartbroken by our disconnected communities, by the smallness of people like Trump continuing to seek power, a way to fight back without going low because “our mothers taught us better than that.” “This is the time to stand up for what we know in our hearts and minds we know is right. ... This is the time to do something.” And to those dragging their feet, Michelle said, “There is no time for that kind of foolishness!”  Yes, indeed, America, hope is making a comeback. And that feeling of hope will turn into action because of the fighting power of women."
Read Michelle Obama's full DNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 8:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/read-michelle-obama-full-dnc-speech-rcna167490,"This is a lightly edited version of Michelle Obama's prepared Democratic National Convention remarks, delivered on Aug. 20. Hello Chicago!  Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it?  Not just here in this arena, but spreading all across this country we love; a familiar feeling that’s been buried too deep for too long.  You know what I’m talking about?  It’s the contagious power of hope!   The anticipation, the energy, and the exhilaration of once again being on the cusp of a brighter day.  The chance to vanquish the demons of fear, division, and hate that have consumed us, and continue pursuing the unfinished promise of this great nation — the dream that our parents and grandparents fought and died and sacrificed for.  America, hope is making a comeback! To be honest, I’m realizing that until recently, I have mourned the dimming of that hope.   Maybe you’ve experienced the same feelings: a deep pit in my stomach; a palpable sense of dread about the future.  And for me, that mourning has been mixed with my own personal grief.  The last time I was in Chicago was to memorialize my mother, the woman who showed me the meaning of hard work, humility, and decency — who set my moral compass high and showed me the power of my voice.   I still feel her loss so profoundly. I wasn’t even sure I’d be steady enough to stand before you tonight.  But my heart compelled me to be here because of the sense of duty I feel to honor her memory, and to remind us all not to squander the sacrifices our elders made to give us a better future.   You see, my mom, in her steady, quiet way, lived out that striving sense of hope every day of her life.   She believed that all children — all people — have value, and that anyone can succeed if given the opportunity.   She and my father didn’t aspire to be wealthy. In fact, they were suspicious of those who took more than they needed.   They understood that it wasn’t enough for their kids to thrive if everyone else around us was drowning.  So my mother volunteered at the local school. She always looked out for the other kids on our block.   She was glad to do the thankless, unglamorous work that for generations, has strengthened the fabric of this nation.   The belief that if you do unto others, that if you love thy neighbor, if you work and scrape and sacrifice, it will pay off — if not for you, then maybe for your children or your grandchildren, those values have been passed on through family farms and factory towns, through tree-lined suburbs and crowded tenements, through prayer groups and National Guard units and social studies classrooms.   Those were the values my mother poured into me until her very last breath.   Kamala Harris and I built our lives on those same foundational values.  Even though our mothers grew up an ocean apart, they shared the same belief in the promise of this country.  That’s why her mother moved here from India at 19.  It’s why she taught Kamala about justice, about our obligation to lift others up and about our responsibility to give more than we take.  She’d often tell her daughter, “Don’t sit around and complain about things — do something!” So with that voice in her head, Kamala went out and worked hard in school, graduating from an HBCU, earning her law degree at a state school and then she went on to work for the people.  Fighting to hold lawbreakers accountable and strengthen the rule of law, fighting to get folks better wages, cheaper prescription drugss, a good education, decent health care, childcare, and elder care.  From a middle-class household, she worked her way up to become vice president of the United States of America.   Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment.  She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency. And she is one of the most dignified — a tribute to her mother, to my mother, and probably to your mother too, the embodiment of the stories we tell ourselves about this country.  Her story is your story. It’s my story. It’s the story of the vast majority of Americans trying to build a better life.  Kamala knows, like we do, that regardless of where you come from, what you look like, who you love, how you worship, or what’s in your bank account, we all deserve the opportunity to build a decent life. All of our contributions deserve to be accepted and valued.  Because no one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American. No one! Kamala has shown her allegiance to this nation, not by spewing anger and bitterness, but by living a life of service and always pushing the doors of opportunity open for others.   She understands that most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth.   If we bankrupt a business, or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third, or fourth chance.   If things don’t go our way, we don’t have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead, we don’t get to change the rules so we always win.  If we see a mountain in front of us, we don’t expect there to be an escalator waiting to take us to the top.  No, we put our heads down. We get to work. In America, we do something.  And throughout her entire life, that’s exactly what we’ve seen from Kamala Harris: the steel of her spine, the steadiness of her upbringing, the honesty of her example and yes, the joy of her laughter and her light.  It couldn’t be more obvious. Of the two major candidates in this race, only Kamala Harris truly understands the unseen labor and unwavering commitment that has always made America great.  Unfortunately, we know what comes next. we know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth.   My husband and I, sadly, know a little something about this.  For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.   His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black.  Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those “Black jobs”?   It’s his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.  You see, gutting our health care, taking away our freedom to control our bodies, the freedom to become a mother through IVF, like I did— those things are not going to improve the health outcomes of our wives, mothers, and daughters.   Shutting down the Department of Education, banning our books —none of that will prepare our kids for the future.  Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love — that doesn’t make anybody’s life better.   Instead, it only makes us small.   And let me tell you, going small is never the answer.  Going small is the opposite of what we teach our children.  Going small is petty. It’s unhealthy. And quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.  Why would we accept this from anyone seeking our highest office?   Why would we normalize this type of backward leadership?  Doing so only demeans and cheapens our politics. It only serves to further discourage good, big-hearted people from wanting to get involved at all.   America, our parents taught us better than that, and we deserve so much better than that.  That’s why we must do everything in our power to elect two of those good, big-hearted people. There is no other choice than Kamala Harris and Tim Walz!  But as we embrace this renewed sense of hope, let us not forget the despair we have felt. Let us not forget what we are up against.  Yes, Kamala and Tim are doing great right now. They’re packing arenas across the country and folks are energized. We’re feeling good.  But there are still so many people who are desperate for a different outcome, who are ready to question and criticize every move Kamala makes, who are eager to spread those lies, who don’t want to vote for a woman, who will continue to prioritize building their wealth over ensuring everyone has enough.  No matter how good we feel tonight or tomorrow or the next day, this is still going to be an uphill battle. So we cannot be our own worst enemies.  No, the minute something goes wrong, the minute a lie takes hold, we cannot start wringing our hands.   We cannot get a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right.   We cannot indulge our anxieties about whether this country will elect someone like Kamala instead of doing everything we can to get someone like Kamala elected.  Kamala and Tim have lived amazing lives. I am confident they will lead with compassion, inclusion, and grace.  But they are still only human. They are not perfect. And like all of us, they will make mistakes.  But luckily, this is not just on them.   No, this is up to us — all of us — to be the solution we seek. It is up to all of us to be the antidote to all the darkness and division.  I don’t care how you identify politically; whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, independent, or none of the above. This is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right.  To stand up not just for our basic freedoms but for decency and humanity — for basic respect, dignity, and empathy — for the values at the very foundation of this democracy.  It’s up to us to remember what Kamala’s mother told her: Don’t just sit around and complain — do something!  So if they lie about her, and they will, we’ve got to do something!  If we see a bad poll, and we will, we’ve got to put down that phone and do something!  If we start feeling tired, if we start feeling that dread creeping back in, we’ve got to pick ourselves up, throw water on our faces, and do something!    We have only two and a half months to get this done; only 11 weeks to make sure every single person we know is registered and has a voting plan.  So we cannot afford for anyone to sit on their hands and wait to be called upon. Don’t complain if no one from the campaign has specifically reached out to ask for your support. There is simply no time for that kind of foolishness.  You know what we need to do.  So consider this to be your official ask: Michelle Obama is asking you to do something! Because this is going to be close.  In some states, just a handful of votes in every precinct could decide the winner.   So we need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt. We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us.   Our fate is in our hands.  In 77 days, we have the power to turn our country away from the fear, division, and smallness of the past.  We have the power to marry our hope with our action.   We have the power to pay forward the love, sweat, and sacrifice of our mothers and fathers and all those who came before us.  We did it before and we sure can do it again.  Let us work like our lives depend on it.  Let us keep moving our country forward and go higher — yes, higher — than we’ve ever gone before. As we elect the next president and vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz!"
Ella Emhoff is the stepdaughter that stepmoms like me have been waiting for,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 6:51 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 20, 2024, 8:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doug-emhoff-kids-ella-cole-kamala-harris-mom-rcna167470,"When I became a stepmom in 2017 to a precocious 6-year-old, I had no idea where to look for role models. I searched high and low, but I was disheartened by what I found. Stepmothers still struggle to outrun the negative stigma of being “the other,” a perception reinforced by fairy tales and, more recently, Republican politicians. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, for one, has publicly delegitimized stepmoms, as has Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Vance has called Vice President Kamala Harris “anti-child” and a “childless cat lady.” But that’s news to her stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, the daughter of Harris’ husband, Doug. (Doug was married to film producer Kerstin Emhoff before the couple divorced in 2008.) Together with her brother, Cole, the 25-year-old recently defended Harris on social media, posting, “I love my three parents.” Imagine the stepchildren and stepparents today who can point to a photo of Kamala and Ella embracing each other (a photo I sent to my stepdaughter) and use it as a touchstone, a guiding force and a powerful example of a nonnuclear family. Imagine watching this blended family on stage at the DNC this week, as Americans fight to elect a presidential candidate who is not only a woman of color, but also a stepmom. I wish I could have had that example a few years ago. Instead, I struggled for guidance. It could feel like the blind leading the blind as I began reading Reddit forums about stepparenting and following niche stepmom influencers. I purchased memoirs written by stepmoms, and the book “The Birth of a Foster, Adoptive or Stepmother: Beyond Biological Mothering Attachments.” I read a few essays online — and wrote a few more. I felt an urgent need to publicly defend stepmothering and fill the cultural gaps I was still experiencing in real time.  Because for years Disney movies (and non-Disney movies) have told us that biological mothers and stepmothers are inherently enemies. We are pitted against one another, with stepmoms assumed to be the evil interlopers. And even if we weren’t “evil” per se, we definitely weren’t “real” parents. As my stepdaughter grew into a teenager, this was a topic we spoke about frequently, wondering aloud why stepmoms were treated so poorly. We made sure to nurture our relationship by celebrating Stepmom’s Day every year.  We all know kids need to see themselves represented in the world around them, especially as they come of age. Ella Emhoff is the perfect example of what it means to challenge nuclear family stereotypes. The so-called First Daughter of Bushwick has armpit hair, crochets, supports trans rights and gender-affirming care and clearly has no patience for anyone trying to denigrate her familial relationships. This isn’t “Cinderella.” It’s much, much better. It is also obvious that both Ella and her brother respect and admire their stepmom. They don't resent his second wife; they are happy that their dad is happy. And this respect is mirrored by Doug’s first wife, Kerstin. Indeed, when Vance’s attacks on Harris started to get picked up by the press, Kerstin, too, came to the aid of her parenting partner. “For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” she said in a statement. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.” And while Republicans may not want to admit it, blended families like these are not only normal — they are common. ""It’s a cool dynamic we all have,"" Ella told The New York Times in 2021. ""And I think it is a good model to show that you can have this and this isn’t weird. Like it’s not weird to be friends or have a good relationship with your ex. It’s actually very healthy."" In his 2020 Atlantic article “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake,” David Brooks writes that today, nuclear families with two-biological-parent households are in the minority. But, he adds, that’s not cause for panic. “The good news is that human beings adapt, even if politics are slow to do so. When one family form stops working, people cast about for something new—sometimes finding it in something very old,” he noted. And one of those “old” ideas is the concept of kinship. ""We think of kin as those biologically related to us,"" Brooks writes. ""But throughout most of human history, kinship was something you could create.”  My closest circle of friends are all in unique and thriving family structures: My best friends are a family of three: an adoptive dad and stepdad and their 13-year-old daughter. They co-parent with the other adoptive dad from the previous marriage. Another friend lives in a polyamorous polycule with their partner of 10 years, their partner’s partner and their partner’s partner’s two kids. They argue this structure only makes their family stronger. One of my close friends in her 40s lives unmarried with her boyfriend and his 6-year-old son, who goes back and forth between homes.  Are these families not “real”? If you live with the child, are you a “real” parent? What about if you drive your stepchild to school for years? What if they sleep next to you when they have nightmares? How can you pass an impossible test?  Stepmom alienation and discrimination is a specific kind of disenfranchised grief. Indeed, it takes a strong person to be a stepparent — this journey is not for the faint of the heart. I’ve even been called a “childless stepmom” over the years; truly the most absurd oxymoron you could come up with.  Believe me: When you hold your stepdaughter’s hair while she throws up, drive her to and from school, fly with her to Europe for the first time, take her to urgent care, argue with her about cleaning her room, help pay for her private school, leave Post-its all over the apartment that say, “Brush your teeth,” help her pick out a dress for her first dance, teach her how to wash her face — and wear deodorant and hula hoop and pump gas — you aren’t “childless,” you’re child-plus.  This is something the first daughter of Bushwick, and potentially the first female president of the United States, both understand. Kamala Harris isn’t some lesser, “other” mom. She’s just Momala. "
Biden’s greatest gift to Kamala Harris is a united Democratic Party,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:52 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-biden-harris-speakers-sanders-aoc-clinton-rcna167360,"The first night of the Democratic National Convention concluded with President Joe Biden’s valedictory speech passing the proverbial torch to his vice president, Kamala Harris. But the proceedings before Biden’s address, which closed with the two hugging on stage, made clear Biden has done more than hand off a presidential nomination. He’s also bequeathed her a party that, thanks in part to his efforts, is perhaps more united than any time in history. Eight years ago, at the 2016 Democratic convention, the divide between partisans for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was impossible to ignore. Sanders’ supporters remained bitter about his defeat in the 2016 primaries, with many falsely accusing the DNC of rigging the election against him — and staging large protests in the streets of Philadelphia. Hundreds of his supporters walked out of the convention hall when Clinton officially clinched the nomination, while those who stayed held up signs criticizing Clinton and maintaining their support for Sanders. Given the narrowness of that November’s election, the left-wing insurgency against Clinton arguably contributed to her defeat. None of these divisions will be evident this week. On Tuesday night, Sanders will deliver a prime-time address, following last night’s similarly plum speaking spot for the woman who seconded his nomination at the 2020 convention: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Indeed, Ocasio-Cortez might have bumped into Clinton backstage on Monday night, as the two spoke just minutes apart. Even more importantly, both women offered similar messages supporting Biden’s accomplishments and Kamala Harris’s promise. The Democratic Party still has some divisions, particularly over the war in Gaza, but even on that issue, there is far more unanimity among elected Democrats than it might seem. On Monday night, when Ocasio-Cortez called for a cease-fire in Gaza and a return of Israeli hostages, she was endorsing the White House’s position on the issue. This new spirit of party unity is driven, in part, by vast and often underappreciated shifts within the two parties. In the run-up to this week’s convention in Chicago, much was written about comparing this event to the party’s Windy City convention in 1968. But for all the similarities, many of those present in Chicago 56 years ago would likely not recognize the Democratic Party of today.  In 1968, there were significant and unbridgeable differences among Democrats over the war in Vietnam, civil rights, law and order and even the proper role of government in the lives of the American people.  In fact, for a good chunk of the Democratic Party’s modern history, there were two distinct political wings — a Southern wing of unreconstructed segregationists and a Northern wing of more liberal Democrats and Black Americans.  But over the past two decades, the South has become increasingly dominated by the GOP, while Democrats have conquered the North and the West Coast. Moderate Democrats — and moderate Republicans — have gone the way of the dodo bird. Polarization has led to less split-ticket voting and greatly decreased the incentives for members of either party to avoid party dogma. The two parties have gone from being unwieldy heterogeneous groupings to largely homogenous political constellations.  But despite greater ideological agreement, the divisions in 2016 were real and serious. Biden has gone out of his way to smooth them over. When he won the Democratic nomination in 2020, with Sanders again the runner-up, Biden did the opposite of what most presumptive nominees have traditionally done — rather than run to the political center, he extended an olive branch to the left. He adopted key elements of the left’s policy agenda on everything from crime and the environment to education, health care and trade.  Biden’s actions as the nominee befitted a politician who navigated between the center and left in his decades in the Senate and seemingly always ended up smack dab in the middle of the two sides. As president, Biden continued this balancing act — maintaining lines of communication with the left and supporting parts of their policy agenda, most notably on the issue of student loan forgiveness. While other Democratic presidents (see Bill Clinton and Barack Obama) have had adversarial relationships with the left, Biden has been the exact opposite. It was small wonder that in July, when many Democrats were clamoring for Biden to step down as party nominee, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders and their allies were among the biggest proponents of Biden staying on the ticket. To be sure, the specter of another Trump term in office is perhaps the strongest unifying force for Democrats. Still, when it comes to hot-button issues that once divided the party — abortion, guns, immigration, trade, unions, civil rights, even criticisms of corporate America — there is little evident daylight among Democrats. That has helped create a striking sense of unity this week that goes well beyond antipathy toward the GOP nominee.  While Republicans are seemingly united by their support of Donald Trump, the seamless shift from Biden to Harris shows that Democrats, in 2024, are largely signing from the same policy hymnal. Even more than his full-throated endorsement of Harris, this might be Biden’s biggest gift to her — and to the Democratic Party."
Why Joe Biden's DNC speech was unlike anything we've seen before,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/joe-biden-donald-trump-dnc-speech-contrast-rcna167406,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC's Aug. 19 special coverage of the Democratic National Convention. President Joe Biden’s appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night was, in many ways, foreign content for those who have followed American politics. Let’s be clear, Biden is a man with a formidable ego. He’s the president of the United States. He was a U.S. senator for more than three decades. He’s spent 50 years in public life. This is someone who occupies a room and someone who likes attention. But that’s also paired with Biden’s deep sense of service. That is what fundamentally contrasts him with Donald Trump, a person who has lived his entire life in service of ego and avoiding ego death. Trump is willing to do anything to preserve his ego, even if it means bringing down the constitutional republic rather than admitting he lost an election. In Biden, you have someone whose last major political act was to get on stage and tell the American people to vote for someone else – to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It's something we’ve never seen before. It’s incredible to watch in real time, to witness someone acting in service of something higher than themselves, in service of the Democratic Party, in service of the country and in service of American democracy.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that troops recovered the bodies in an overnight operation in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.” * On a related note: “The Biden administration is again putting its diplomatic heft behind an effort to dislodge the logjam in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a cease-fire to end the 10-month-long war in Gaza, and American officials have voiced optimism over the potential for a breakthrough. Israeli and Hamas officials are striking a different tone.” * In Ukraine: “The Russian military said on Tuesday that its forces had taken control of what it described as the strategically important logistics hub of Niu-York in eastern Ukraine, part of Moscow’s grinding drive to capture the entire Donetsk region.” * FAA: “The Federal Aviation Administration will require inspections of hundreds of Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a LATAM Airlines plane in March took a sudden midair plunge that injured at least 50 people.” * Maybe it’s time for observers to reassess Musk’s reputation as a private-sector genius? “The $13 billion that Elon Musk borrowed to buy Twitter has turned into the worst merger-finance deal for banks since the 2008-09 financial crisis.” * A changing job market: “A new labor market survey shows Americans have rarely felt more in need of new job opportunities — an indication of a more negative outlook about the economy despite other data that suggests a more stable picture. The New York Federal Reserve’s latest poll of consumers found 28.4% of respondents were looking for a job — the highest reading since March 2014 and up from 19.4% a year ago. That includes both individuals already out of a job and ones currently employed but seeking new roles.” * Good move: “Disney has backpedaled on its stance in a wrongful death suit filed by a widower whose wife died after eating at a restaurant in Disney World, now saying it’ll waive arbitration that it argued the man agreed to when signing up for Disney+.” See you tomorrow."
Could Taylor Swift sue Trump over his social media post?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/taylor-swift-sue-trump-truth-social-post-ai-rcna167380,"Could Taylor Swift sue Donald Trump? The question arises after the GOP presidential nominee shared several images (some generated by artificial intelligence) on his social media platform suggesting that the singer and her fans support his campaign. One of the images portrayed Swift’s likeness in Uncle Sam-style fashion, accompanied by the text: “Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.” The former president added: “I accept!” Swift could sue. And while there are any number of reasons that the pop star won’t expend the effort of taking Trump to court, one legal area that could be relevant is the right of publicity, which protects people from certain forms of unauthorized exploitation. That subject arose in another high-profile context recently, when OpenAI developed a chatbot voice assistant that sounded much like Scarlett Johansson; the company subsequently pulled it after public scrutiny, but denied that it was an imitation of the actor’s voice. (Representatives for Trump’s campaign and Swift didn’t immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.) Trump’s post comes as many legal questions remain unanswered in this era of AI proliferation and the internet. There isn’t presently reason to think that this episode will become a legal case that tests those frontiers — saying nothing of whatever would come of such a case, including any defenses (including on First Amendment grounds) that Trump would seek to raise. But if he continues to potentially antagonize the star, whose political sympathies seem to lie elsewhere, we may find out how much of a case she has.

Bob Menendez acquittal motion previews appeal issues in bribery case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 20, 2024, 2:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/bob-menendez-motion-bribery-corruption-judge-rcna167425,"Bob Menendez is set to resign his Senate seat on Tuesday, following his federal corruption convictions last month. But while his political chapter as a long-serving New Jersey Democrat is closing, his legal battle may be just beginning. It will take many months, if not years, for that legal fight to conclude. But a new motion from his defense lawyers may signal the issues that he’ll press on appeal, likely all the way to the Supreme Court. A New York federal jury found him guilty on all counts including bribery, acting as a foreign agent and obstructing justice.  That motion for a post-trial acquittal or new trial, filed in the trial court Monday, is a long shot to succeed. But in the likely event that the motion is denied and his case proceeds to sentencing on Oct. 29, it may foreshadow issues that he’ll raise to higher courts.  Contending that all of his convictions must be reversed, Menendez’s lawyers wrote to U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in the Southern District of New York that “if sustained on such a surprisingly thin reed of evidence, these convictions will make terrible, dangerous law.” The defense lawyers argued that, despite alleging that Menendez had agreed to sell official acts for bribes, prosecutors at trial “offered no actual evidence of an agreement, just speculation masked as inference.”  Among the defense’s specific claims are that the government failed to prove a quid pro quo and that Menendez’s “speech or debate” protections for members of Congress were violated. They also argue that the evidence was otherwise insufficient and that New York was an improper venue, with the bulk of the conduct occurring in New Jersey or Washington, D.C.  A Supreme Court case frequently cited in the motion is McDonnell v. United States, where the high court in 2016 narrowed corruption-related prosecutions in siding with former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. The justices have continued to side with defendants in such cases in the years since, including just this past term in Snyder v. United States, which curbed the use of federal bribery law against state and local officials, with the court holding that the law doesn’t make it a crime for officials to accept gratuities for past acts. Menendez’s lawyers briefly cite the Snyder case as well, in arguing that “because the government prosecuted Menendez on a theory of bribes, not gratuities, the evidence of after-the-fact payments cannot be used to sustain a bribery conviction absent some evidence that Senator Menendez was expecting these after-the-fact payments. No such evidence was offered.” The appellate issues may further crystallize as the case moves forward, with the next highest court being the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as his lawyers work to make Menendez’s case one of the next in that line of favorable Supreme Court precedents for political corruption defendants.
