Trump again calls for flag-burning punishment: 'We'll make it constitutional',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 8:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-first-amendment-supreme-court-rcna168381,"Donald Trump is still calling for a punishment that violates the Constitution: jailing people who burn the American flag. It’s been one of the Republican presidential nominee’s consistent proposals this election cycle. Trump just pushed the idea again Monday while speaking in Detroit to the National Guard Association of the United States. “You burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year,” the former president said, adding: “We gotta do it. ... They say, ‘Sir, that’s unconstitutional.’ We’ll make it constitutional.”  The “they” who said that’s unconstitutional was a Supreme Court majority that included conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That hasn’t stopped Trump from advocating the idea after protests outside the Israeli consulate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week and in Washington, D.C., last month during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address.    As for “mak[ing] it constitutional,” we were reminded last month how hard it is to amend the Constitution when President Joe Biden proposed an amendment in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in Trump v. United States. Of course, as we saw in the immunity case, an easier route to accomplish Republican legal goals is by going through the justices themselves — though there isn’t a flag-burning case before the high court currently presenting that opportunity.

Republicans eye 'parallel' probe of Trump assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 8:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-eye-parallel-probe-trump-assassination-attempt-rcna168410,"On the surface, Republicans had reason to be pleased by the congressional response to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. In the House, for example, both parties’ leaders quickly came to an agreement to create a bipartisan investigatory task force — featuring seven Republican and six Democratic lawmakers — and it was approved unanimously. What’s more, House Speaker Mike Johnson chose several far-right election deniers and conspiracy theorists to serve on the panel, which has wasted no time getting to work, despite the fact that Congress is on its summer break. Indeed, task force members have already traveled to the scene of the Pennsylvania shooting for a first-hand examination. And yet, some GOP members still aren’t pleased. Politico reported: “So myself and Cory Mills are leading a parallel investigation into what happened on J-13th and the assassination attempt,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said on a podcast last week, referring to the July 13 shooting. “And we’re doing that because, like many of your listeners, we don’t trust the federal government to actually do the job necessary.” Crane, incidentally, recently told a conservative media outlet, in reference to the shooting, “I don’t put it past some of the people in our government, their willingness to do anything to get rid of President Donald Trump.” Just so we’re all clear, the idea that House GOP leaders chose “serious” Republicans to serve on the task force is a difficult idea to take seriously. The speaker tapped Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, for example, and he’s an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee is also on the panel, despite being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and despite the fact that his right-wing background was so controversial in 2017 that the Senate wouldn’t confirm him when Trump nominated him to serve as secretary of the Army. The task force will be chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who, in addition to being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, is also up to his ears in the fake elector scandal; has accused Barack Obama of running a secret “shadow government”; and initially responded to the assassination attempt by describing it without evidence as an “attack from the left.” Perhaps most notable of all is Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana — an election denier who’s also taken a leading role in concocting deeply weird conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, including bizarre allegations related to the FBI and “ghost buses.” As a recent New York Times report summarized, “Even by a conspiracy theorist’s standards, the wild claims made by Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, stand out.” Johnson, eyeing “serious” members, nevertheless tapped Higgins for the congressional investigation. And yet, Crane and Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida have apparently concluded that the task force’s GOP members aren’t quite unhinged enough, necessitating a “parallel” examination. As a result, the public should expect to eventually see two reports: one from a bipartisan task force led by far-right Republicans, and another from a partisan task force led by even-further-to-the-right Republicans. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why does Trump want a Space National Guard and an ‘Iron Dome’?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-want-space-national-guard-iron-dome-rcna168396,         
"Republicans find new, unfortunate ways to reward fake electors",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 6:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-find-new-unfortunate-ways-reward-fake-electors-rcna168383,"Common sense might suggest that the Republican Party’s fake electors from the 2020 elections would be politically radioactive in the GOP. It’s apparently not working out that way, however. Take the latest developments in Michigan, for example. The Detroit News reported: Among the 15 are a half-dozen fake electors from four years ago. Ahead of the local vote, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, chair of Michigan Republican Party, denounced efforts to hold the fake electors legally accountable, insisting that the alleged criminals have been “singled out potentially very unfairly.” The comments were bizarre, as was the state GOP’s willingness to choose so many fake electors to serve as presidential electors again this year. But stepping back, the problem isn’t just that Republicans rewarded fake electors, the problem is made worse by the fact that Republicans keep rewarding fake electors. In case anyone needs a refresher, after Trump’s defeat, Republicans in several states created forged election materials, pretending to be “duly elected and qualified electors” and sent the documents to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Archivist, among others, as if the fake materials were legitimate. They were not. These Republicans came to be known as their party’s “fake electors.” The larger criminal scandal surrounding their scheme has racked up indictment totals unseen since Watergate and Iran-Contra. In theory, GOP officials should be embarrassed by the entire controversy. In practice, the party is leaning into its own mess. We learned in May, for example, that several fake electors in Nevada were elected to serve as delegates to the Republican National Convention, even after they were criminally charged. “Clearly, lessons learned,” The Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston said sarcastically in response to the news. A month earlier, state prosecutors in Arizona indicted 18 Republicans as part of the party’s fake elector scheme, resulting in allegations of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. Some of them were chosen as convention delegates, too. After the state GOP made the decision, The Arizona Republic’s Laurie Roberts summarized in a column, “The Arizona Republican Party on Saturday sent a flat out, full-throated, flabbergasting message to the voters of this great state. We be crazy, they proclaimed.” Last month, CNN reported that Republicans from seven battleground states agreed to send “fake electors and others who worked to upend the 2020 election results to represent their state parties at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.” Not all of the fake electors who served as convention delegates were under criminal indictment — but some were, and the party didn’t seem to care. It’s against this backdrop that Michigan Republicans backed indicted fake electors, too. As the criminal charges piled up, it seemed implausible that GOP officials would extend rewards to those who were caught serving as fake electors. And yet, here we are.

"Trump calls his former chief of staff a ‘terrible, stupid person’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-calls-former-chief-staff-terrible-stupid-person-rcna168369,"Donald Trump added to his unfortunate record of disparaging military service two weeks ago when the former president said the Presidential Medal of Freedom was “much better” than the Medal of Honor — comments the Veterans of Foreign Wars, among others, described as “asinine.” Former Trump chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, a fierce critic of his former boss, agreed. “The two awards cannot be compared in any way,” he told CNN. “Not even close.” A week later, the GOP presidential nominee returned fire. The New York Times reported: In case it weren’t quite enough that Trump referred to his own former White House chief of staff as “one of the dumbest people” he’s ever met, in the same interview, the Republican called Kelly a “lowlife” and a “terrible, stupid person.” With 10 weeks remaining before Election Day, Trump is directing some of his harshest criticisms at the retired Marine general he tapped to oversee the Department of Homeland Security and his own White House. Indeed, this latest offensive extends one of the strangest ongoing feuds in contemporary American politics. Circling back to our earlier coverage, it was just two months ago when Trump, unprompted, lashed out at Kelly as “dumb” and a “lost soul.” Months earlier, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” There was no great mystery as to the motivation for the offensive. After all, Kelly is the one who confirmed on the record that Trump really did denigrate American servicemembers as “suckers and losers.” “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly told CNN in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. I continue to believe the fact that the Republican nominee is publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign.

Michigan sheriff reportedly faces a state investigation over Trump’s campaign event in Howell,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-howell-michigan-sheriff-mike-murphy-investigation-rcna168312,"A Michigan sheriff who hosted Donald Trump last week reportedly is facing an investigation over complaints that the event violated the state’s campaign finance law. Trump’s choice of Howell, Michigan, was controversial in and of itself, given that he was visiting shortly after white supremacists gathered there and celebrated him and Adolf Hitler. But the props at the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office event — including law enforcement officers and sheriff’s vehicles carefully staged in the background — were just as disturbing as the location. And they gave the impression that the sheriff’s office was endorsing the GOP presidential nominee, despite Sheriff Mike Murphy’s insistence beforehand that it would be a news conference and not a political event. On Thursday, the Detroit Metro Times reported that two complaints filed over the event have prompted the state’s Bureau of Elections to investigate whether Murphy violated the Michigan Campaign Finance Act. An attorney told local outlet MLive that the sheriff could potentially skirt legal trouble by allowing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to speak in the same setting. And Murphy — who denied having committed any violation — told the outlet he would “extend her the same courtesy for sure.” Indeed, inviting Harris (no matter her response) may help the sheriff elude legal consequences, but it doesn’t address the ethical — and I’d argue moral — dilemma that his office has created. Nor does it address the legitimacy crisis that Murphy has unleashed. At last week’s event, Murphy’s officers stood behind Trump as he rambled and falsely accused Harris and the Democratic Party of letting crime run rampant, claims that don’t align with reality. So the essence of Trump’s speech wasn’t just a lie — it was a lie told by a criminal in his own right, one who has fomented an insurrection in which police officers were beaten, and who also has backed policing practices — such as stop and frisk — that have been used to prey upon Black and Latino people disproportionately. And yet members of the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office lent Trump their gravitas by literally backing him up as he told this lie. It begs the question: Why should the local residents trust these officers to protect their rights, if the department was so willing to let them be aligned with one of the most notorious lawbreakers in American history? Can a law enforcement officer legitimately claim to uphold the Constitution after appearing alongside a man who has proposed “termination” of some of it? To be sure, these aren’t merely questions for the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office; many other officers across the nation also have posed with Trump since his election loss in 2020. All of them seemingly without a care in the world for the grim message it sends to the residents they encounter daily — that they care about power and control more than law and order."
Ron DeSantis' anti-woke crusade just suffered a humiliating defeat,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ron-desantis-anti-woke-school-boards-rcna167958,"Florida was supposed to be where “woke goes to die,” as Gov. Ron DeSantis is fond of saying. But last week he suffered a humiliating defeat, as only six of the 23 school board candidates he endorsed won in races across the state. Eleven were defeated outright, while a half-dozen more races remain undecided.  A columnist for The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville put the matter succinctly: “DeSantis is out of juice.” The guy compared by some pundits to Ronald Reagan only a couple of years ago found his Waterloo in ... the Tampa burbs. Those results came as Democrats gathered in Chicago to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris for president. The eyes of the nation weren’t on Tallahassee, in other words, yet the Florida school board outcomes — as minor as they may seem — say something significant about our national politics, about the profound thirst of most Americans for a pragmatic politics that doesn’t cater to the fringe or play on our resentments. As one social media user put it, “Florida wants moderates not MAGA.” With former President Donald Trump continuing to struggle to define Harris and starting to show significant slippage in some polls, the same may be true of the country at large. The striking number of Republicans who spoke at the Democratic convention is more evidence of that trend. According to The Associated Press, 83% of DeSantis school board nominees won in 2022. This time around, he will be lucky to break 50% after runoffs in November.  The governor’s supporters will surely blame “the woke mind virus,” but that’s just an excuse for the failed attempt to install right-wing ideologues in and around Tampa (Pinellas and Hillsborough counties), among other parts of the state. In South Florida’s Broward County, two DeSantis appointees were ousted. One of his school board candidates lost in a district that every Republican presidential candidate since John McCain in 2008 has won, according to Andrew Pantazi, editor of the scrappy Jacksonville outlet The Tributary.     Faced with this defeat at the hands of voters, DeSantis simply appointed one of the Broward losers to the state Board of Education. The candidates DeSantis endorsed were also boosted by Moms for Liberty, a sophisticated Christian nationalist outfit disguised as a kaffeeklatsch of well-meaning suburban ladies worried about their children reading Anne Frank’s diary. They successfully pushed to ban an illustrated version of that book, among many others: Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” and Judy Blume’s “Forever,” to name just two flagrant examples. DeSantis calls this “freedom.”  Punishing the Disney Corp. for speaking out in favor of LGBTQ rights was “freedom,” too. Removing elected prosecutors because he disagrees with their positions on abortion rights? DeSantis did that in the name of freedom, too. Because only he understands the true nature of the threat: “groomer” teachers and drag queens trying to “convert” children, George Soros-funded prosecutors opening up the prisons and letting criminals run wild, the corporate media (except Fox News) brainwashing you into believing the sea level around Miami is rising because of some liberal fantasy called “climate change.” Floridians told DeSantis that they aren’t stupid. They don’t need his heavy hand in choosing local educators — or prosecutors.  And they certainly don’t want to be bullied by Moms of Liberty, which wants Americans to read “The Making of America,” a deranged tract that effectively glorifies slavery. It asks parents to take a pledge in favor of a “moral upbringing” for children. (Its co-founder Bridget Ziegler and her husband, Christian — a former Florida GOP chair — are embroiled in numerous scandals, including one involving an alleged ménage à trois.) DeSantis rose to prominence with his opposition to coronavirus lockdowns and business closures. In the fall of 2020, he fought to open schools across the state, even as many Democrats argued it was unsafe to do so. DeSantis turned out to be correct, and he began to earn national attention. As so often happens to be the case, the seductions of fame, the whispers about a presidential run, proved impossible to resist. To stay in the news, DeSantis had to keep making news, which he did by taking ever more extreme positions: on vaccines, masks, education, corporations, climate change, race. But his brief foray into presidential politics was a debacle of historic proportions, which began with a bungled social media rollout and ended amid speculation about whether the governor wore high heels (yes, he does). The same conventional wisdom that had compared DeSantis to Reagan argued that he lost because Trump took up so much room. And that was true to an extent. But it was clear — as it was once again in last Tuesday’s results — that the American people have no interest in his joyless, ideological style of politics. Still, the guy keeps trying, as if the problem were that he isn’t cruel and vindictive enough. DeSantis recently proposed to open Florida parks to development. Because, you know, Florida doesn’t have enough golf courses or strip malls. The plan met with what the AP described as “widespread opposition across the political spectrum,” and it appears to be already falling apart, with a key backer pulling out. It was classic DeSantis, equal parts mean and inept. Whatever the people of Florida voted for when they elected him, they did not vote for this."

"Jack Smith could win his appeal, but still have to deal with Judge Cannon",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 4:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-judge-aileen-cannon-classified-documents-rcna168242,"Special counsel Jack Smith filed his brief to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, urging the court to reverse U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case. The Justice Department has a decent chance of prevailing, but reviving the case alone won’t solve a continuing challenge Smith would still face: Cannon herself. In her latest avant-garde move in the former president’s favor, the Trump appointee tossed the federal case last month on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded. In his appellate brief, the special counsel highlights how much of an outlier Cannon’s ruling was. Noting the longtime acceptance of special counsels, the government wrote that Cannon’s “contrary view conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the Attorney General has such authority, and it is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government.” Recall that, before the former president was charged in this case, the 11th Circuit had already rebuked Cannon’s eccentrically Trump-friendly handling of litigation stemming from the Mar-a-Lago search warrant in 2022. That raised questions when Cannon was randomly assigned to the criminal case last year about whether she could be removed. The short answer is that, as I’ve written before during this saga, it’s more difficult to reassign a judge than you might think, and we shouldn’t assume that that will happen here, absent the judge doing something even more outlandish than she has to date. Smith’s brief didn’t indicate his intention to seek a new judge. That doesn’t mean that the appeals court couldn’t still remove her while reversing her, but there’s reason to not expect that here. One thing to keep in mind is how Cannon arrived at her ruling. She cited, among other things, Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion in the Trump immunity case, in which the Republican appointee went out of his way to question Smith’s appointment. That wasn’t the issue in the immunity case, so we don’t know how many other justices (if any) agree with Thomas. But it would seemingly make it more difficult to kick a judge off a case in part for reaching a decision citing a sitting Supreme Court justice’s reasoning, however flawed that reasoning is. Of course, if the high court ultimately upholds Cannon’s ruling if the case gets to the justices, that would moot any reassignment issue — as would a Trump presidential victory in November, which could lead to him eliminating the case entirely. That’s all to say that even if Smith succeeds in his current task (something we won’t know the answer to for a while), the case will remain on unsteady ground so long as Cannon presides. And given the great discretion afforded trial court judges, including during their handling of trials themselves, there’d be plenty more opportunity for mischief if the case goes back to her. But at the moment, that might be Smith’s best realistic outcome.   Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

This aspect of Louisiana’s abortion ban is deliberately vague — and deliberately cruel,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 3:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dnc-louisiana-abortion-ban-kaitlyn-joshua-liz-murrill-rcna168301,"On the opening night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, Kaitlyn Joshua, a resident of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was one of three women who walked onto the main stage at the United Center and described for the country how she almost lost her life to a miscarriage in 2022. She was getting ready for her daughter’s “fourth birthday party,” she said, when something didn’t feel right. “Two emergency rooms sent me away because of Louisiana’s abortion ban.” Joshua continued: “No one would confirm that I was miscarrying. I was in pain, bleeding so much that my husband feared for my life. No woman should experience what I endured. But too many have. They write to me saying, ‘What happened to you happened to me.’ Sometimes they’re miscarrying and are scared to tell anyone. Even their doctors. Our daughters deserve better. America deserves better.” Joshua’s story warrants our sympathy, and our outrage, but in response, Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, demonstrating that Republicans are terrified of the consequences of their abortion bans being known, essentially called Joshua a liar. In a post that same night on X, Murrill wrote, “Once again, the Democrats have their facts wrong. There is nothing in our bipartisan law that prohibits emergency care for someone having a miscarriage or any emergency situation during pregnancy. Nothing. Hard stop.” In a second post, Murrill wrote that “doctors are legally required to care for a pregnant woman who suffers an emergent health crisis, whether that’s appendicitis or a miscarriage.” No matter what Murrill wants the world to believe, the truth is Joshua suffered because of the abortion ban that went into effect in Louisiana after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It’s not at all surprising to hear Joshua say two Louisiana hospitals refused to treat her. In fact, it’s predictable. Doctors and hospital officials across Louisiana have repeatedly confirmed that our vague laws on this “life of the mother” exception are causing dangerous problems, and medical officials are afraid of providing care for a woman having a miscarriage and then being arrested and charged. The law requires a person to essentially be on her deathbed before allowing the exception. Those doctors should be afraid. In June 2022, five days after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 6-3 to overturn Roe, Murrill, then a chief deputy to Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, drafted a letter for Landry that he sent the Louisiana State Medical Society. A physician who performed an “elective” abortion, that Murrill/Landry letter said, would risk their “liberty and medical license.” They said that! It’s telling that instead of clarifying the new law, they threatened to arrest doctors and end their careers. After Murrill essentially accused Joshua of lying on X, the Louisiana Right to Life also posted to bring attention to the state’s “life of the mother” exception and wrote, “Ultimately, the fault for the substandard treatment lies with the practitioners that managed her case.” That post accused the DNC of “utilizing a tragic story to elicit confusion and disapproval for pro-life laws.” One wonders if Murrill would prosecute a physician who did not terminate a pregnancy when the woman’s life was in danger. Is the worth of a woman’s life now to be decided by politicians? What women like Joshua know, and what Murrill and the Louisiana Right to Life don’t want to admit, is that we have unusable laws, drafted purposely to prevent any abortion, for any reason. Hospitals and doctors are terrified of arrest, so they err on the side of virtually no treatment for miscarriage and complications. So many women have come forward with their painful stories. The Department of Health has publicly referred questions on abortion to Murrill, the highest ranking prosecutor in the state. Those are the facts. If the powerful in the state cared about women’s lives, then they’d pass a law to clarify the exceptions related to health and life of the mother and a nonviable fetus. (Soon after the ban went into effect, Nancy Davis, another Baton Rouge woman, found out her fetus was developing without a skull, and had to travel to New York for an abortion because she couldn’t get care in Louisiana.) Yet every time legislators have tried to do this, Louisiana Right to Life, which is politically powerful, has crushed those efforts. They think that women and doctors lie. It’s easier to punish someone when the law is vague. This demeaning treatment of women is not new, and it certainly is bipartisan. Former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and his wife ran hard on a campaign of “life,” judging and punishing women who choose to terminate a pregnancy. Edwards signed every abortion-related law that landed on his desk. He signed the 2022 trigger ban, even though it would have become law without his signature, that did not include a rape and incest exception that he claimed he supported. He noted in an interview that prior to Roe being overturned, the abortion debate in the Louisiana legislature was “largely an academic exercise,” meaning the cruelty it would inflict upon women was only theoretical and something officials could never be held accountable for. But now we’re seeing those consequences play out in real life. Louisiana is often described as “last in everything.” Maybe it’s because we treat women — some women — as expendable, political pawns. Dragging Kaitlyn Joshua in the media for telling her truth is how the attorney general, Landry's administration and Louisiana Right to Life think they can defend the indefensible. In response to Louisiana Right to Life’s social media thread blaming the hospitals Joshua visited — and not Louisiana law — for her suffering, Joshua responded, “They are scared y’all. Instead of Right to Life using their platform to amplify the issues around the same ban they endorsed, that is STILL comprising basic maternal care in our state, instead of owning the harm they caused and the confusion they created, they do this!!!”  They are scared. They’re scared of the public knowing that this is what total abortion bans mean, and scared of Joshua telling women: what happened to me could happen to you. "
This DOJ lawsuit is just one of several good signs for exhausted renters and homeowners,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 2:33 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-rising-rent-control-plan-rcna168286,"Our homes are supposed to offer us shelter from the troubles of the world, but over the past two decades, they’ve increasingly become a place where greater economic forces batter millions of Americans. First, the Great Recession’s foreclosure crisis saw 10 million homeowners lose their homes between 2007 and 2014. Now we are experiencing a housing affordability crisis. Rents are up 30% since early 2020, while home prices have jumped 47%.  But, finally, it appears there might be some relief at hand. Recent announcements from the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department and Vice President Kamala Harris all, in their own way, tackle the problem that’s left millions of Americans struggling to find a place to call their own. Help can’t come soon enough. A record number of Americans are rent-burdened — that is, spending 30% or more of their income on housing costs. At the same time, the cost of buying a home is soaring. That’s good news for the 65 million Americans who own their own residences — to this day, housing remains the greatest source of wealth for a majority of Americans — but bad news for those seeking to gain a foothold in property ownership. The traditional — and overly simplified — explanation for rising housing costs is that the U.S. is short millions of houses, townhouses and apartments. Those lucky enough to own their residence, according to this line of thought, selfishly fight any development near their homes, restricting supply and sending prices soaring. As wannabe owners have an increasingly hard time affording a home, they remain stuck in the rental market, increasing demand. While there is something to these beliefs, the reality is a bit more complex. One complication is apparent in the lawsuit the Justice Department and eight states filed Friday against software company RealPage. The private equity-owned company provides revenue management software for landlords and controls an estimated 80% of that market. Landlords would report on their rental units to RealPage, which would, in turn, possessing nonpublic data detailing what competitors were charging, spit out a recommended rental price. The government alleges this service amounts to a form of illegal collusion, updated for the web 3.0 era. The lawsuit uses RealPage’s own words to make the point, noting the company claimed, “Our tool insures that [landlords] are driving every possible opportunity to increase price in even the most downward trending or unexpected conditions.” Lower rents, on the other hand, would be of enormous help to millions of Americans. According to the lawsuit, the percentage of household income spent on rent by Americans without a college degree increased from 30% in 2000 to 42% in 2017. Unsurprisingly, RealPage denies the charges. But, privately, both its own executives and its satisfied customers beg to differ. “I always liked this product because your algorithm uses proprietary data from other subscribers to suggest rents and term. That’s classic price-fixing,” one landlord wrote in an email cited in the lawsuit. One of the company’s vice presidents touted the company’s software as discouraging clients “trying to compete against one other.” The Justice Department’s lawsuit came on the heels of Vice President Kamala Harris unveiling her plan to boost homeownership and real estate construction. In that plan, the Democratic nominee backs Senate Democrats’ bill deeming RealPage’s business model illegal, but there’s much more. The Harris administration — if, that is, there is a Harris administration — is aiming for 3 million new residences by the end of her first term. She would provide financial assistance and tax breaks to real-estate investors who target first-time home buyers, and encourage states and localities to reduce bureaucratic barriers to building. And she’d also seek to expand a tax credit available to low-income renters, while ending tax policies that incentivize Wall Street-backed corporations snapping up single-family homes. That’s all well and good, but people still need to afford the financing of these homes — which brings us to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s declaration Friday that “the time has come” for the central bank to cut interest rates. That means the rise in mortgage interest rates, which began when the Fed hiked interest rates during 2022 and 2023, may finally be ending. It’s not just that high interest rates put a crimp in housing starts for both single family and multi-unit residences, which dropped to a four-year low in July. Because many homeowners locked in mortgages with interest rates in the low single digits before 2022, the sharp increase since has kept them effectively locked in place, unable to upgrade or downsize without taking a significant financial hit. As a result, housing inventory for sale remains near historic lows, helping fuel record high prices. Hopefully, the interest rate drop will prompt some of those homeowners into selling — and get some of those unhappy renters into a home of their own. Housing is a basic human right, but all too often housing policy gets left on the back burner. All these actions combined should begin to shift the balance of power away from those lucky enough to already own a bit of real estate, and back toward those seeking to get a foothold, whether as homeowners or renters. It can’t happen soon enough."

RFK Jr.'s endorsement of Donald Trump confirms what we've suspected all along,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-donald-trump-endorsement-kennedy-conspiracy-rcna168287,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 25 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Shunned by Democrats and estranged from his family, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been desperate for validation. So desperate, in fact, that he has now joined forces with Donald Trump.  Of course, as the most prolific anti-vax conspiracy theorist in the country, Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump was a long time coming. Frankly, the two have a lot in common: Both have enormous egos that cloud their judgment, both rely on misinformation to prey on people’s fears, and both leverage their last name for their own self-interest. But for Kennedy, this endorsement also marks another act of rebellion against his family and the institutions they helped build. Although he shares the same name as his father, he could not be more different.  His dad — the original Robert Kennedy — was driven by a genuine concern for the health and welfare of the American people. He was a champion of the underprivileged and the vulnerable. He appealed to people’s better angels, not their worst instincts.  When it came to modern medicine, he said those with power and influence have a duty to aid the less fortunate. As Kennedy told a group of doctors in Indiana in 1968, “We have to recognize those of us who have the advantages that you have and that I have that we have an obligation of responsibility to those who do not.” In other words, Kennedy believed that it was not enough to merely ""do no harm"" — he felt strongly that people in a position to help others have an obligation to do so.   Needless to say, the apple has fallen pretty far from the tree. Kennedy has not only failed in his “obligation of responsibility,” he’s actually done the opposite. He’s used his privilege and his name to encourage the most vulnerable Americans to turn their backs on modern medicine. He’s used falsehoods to stoke widespread fear of even routine vaccines, including the vaccines that eradicated measles, mumps and polio. If Trump and Kennedy have their way, parents will once again have to worry that their kids could be susceptible to life-threatening diseases at school.   But here’s the thing: Kennedy is not only insulting his father’s legacy, he’s also trying to sabotage the party that his family has shaped and influenced for more than six decades. Remember, his endorsement comes just days after new reporting showed his candidacy was now costing Trump more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris. We also can’t forget that Kennedy’s political ambitions were, in part, financed by one of Trump’s biggest billionaire donors. By endorsing Trump, Kennedy is simply confirming what we suspected all along: that his goal is to be a spoiler for the Democratic ticket. And while we still don’t know what the real impact of this endorsement will be, we do know that the headlines shouldn’t read: “Kennedy endorses Trump.” They should read: “Dangerous conspiracy theorists join forces.”  Join Jen Psaki, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

Here's what Kamala Harris has to do in high-stakes sit-down interview,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-tim-walz-interview-donald-trump-rcna168274,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 25 episode of ""Alex Witt Reports."" This week, Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to sit down for her first interview as a presidential candidate. Since entering the race, Harris has been criticized for her lack of interviews and press conferences. Earlier this month, she promised to sit down for an interview by the end of August. With less than a week to go, NBC News is now reporting Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, will take part in a joint interview in the coming days, though it’s unclear with whom or precisely when that will happen.   This first interview is critically important for the Harris campaign. It could help keep up the incredible momentum she’s built since entering the race. It’s also a very important moment for the country. Republicans and Democrats alike need to see Harris engaged in an interview with a sober, serious reporter. She needs to be asked tough questions and provide answers to the American people — on the record. Have any of her policy positions shifted since she ran for president in 2019? If so, why did those shifts occur? I’m sure she’ll get pressed on her role within the Biden-Harris administration on hot-button issues like immigration and the border. She may even get questions on foreign policy and the Afghanistan withdrawal.   But, in some ways, it’s more about how the vice president answers these questions than the actual answers themselves. There will likely be some uncomfortable moments for Harris, but it’s those moments that are the most important. The American people need to see how she handles being asked tough questions and how she reacts under pressure.  The Trump campaign’s first attack ad against Harris included an exchange between the vice president and NBC News’ Lester Holt during a 2021 interview. When Harris was asked by Holt why she had not visited the border as vice president she quipped back that she had also not been to Europe. Is that the Harris we’ll see this week — defensive under pressure? Or will we see the strength and directness she’s displayed over the last four weeks? "
Trump could be starting to face the music over his campaign’s use of an Isaac Hayes song,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:03 PM PDT / Updated Sept. 4, 2024, 6:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-isaac-hayes-song-hold-on-im-coming-rcna168275,"UPDATE (Sept. 7, 7:15 a.m. ET): A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Donald Trump’s campaign to stop using musician Isaac Hayes’ song “Hold On, I’m Coming,” in response to a lawsuit from the Hayes estate. It looks like Donald Trump could be starting to face the music over his campaign’s unauthorized use of an Isaac Hayes song. As Rolling Stone reported: Isaac Hayes III announced the latest development in a post on X, writing in part: “See you in court.” (Trump does not appear to have publicly commented on the matter.) Trump certainly isn’t the only politician who’s been told to bug off by an artist or their estate after bumping one of their songs at his rallies. But he sure seems to have received more cease-and-desist demands than just about any other candidate. And frankly, while any personal aversion to Trump would be justified, some of these artists’ refusals just sound like good business sense. After all, it’s certainly plausible that a song could lose replay value if it’s viewed as a soundtrack for one — or more — of Trump’s hate-fueled events, during which he has ranted about immigrants and Jewish people, among others. And as the younger Hayes explained to Joy Reid recently, that potential diminution of value could be devastating for estates like his father’s, whose owners have had to work long and hard to gain control of the artist’s songs in the first place. Watch a clip of Joy’s interview with Hayes and his lawyer, James Walker Jr., below."
How racism claims play into Trump's Georgia criminal case appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 1:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fani-willis-racism-georgia-election-case-rcna168265,"The issue of race permeates Donald Trump’s Georgia state election interference case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Trump’s latest court filing in a pretrial appeal seeking Willis’ disqualification reminds us that it surfaces in a legal claim, specifically.    At least, the former president — who has harnessed racism for his political ends — wants it to be an issue that kicks Willis off the case or even gets it dismissed.  Recall that, back in March, Judge Scott McAfee declined to force Willis’ removal. The defense had alleged a conflict of interest stemming from her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. McAfee didn’t find an actual conflict but said the appearance of impropriety required Willis or Wade to step down, and the latter did.  Responding to a separate defense claim, relevant to Trump’s new court filing on Monday, McAfee criticized a speech that Willis gave at an Atlanta church whose effect, the judge wrote in his March ruling, “was to cast racial aspersions at an indicted Defendant’s decision to file this pretrial motion.” Yet the trial judge concluded that Willis didn’t cross the line to the point of denying a fair trial or requiring her disqualification. The state criminal case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been on hold pending the appeal, where this issue is the focus of the GOP presidential nominee’s latest filing to Georgia’s state appeals court. “Willis falsely declared that allegations against her stemmed from racism to hide the fact that they were true,” his lawyers wrote of the prosecutor, who is Black. She “obviously intended that every potential Fulton County juror who heard or read Willis’ racist speech should label the defendants as racists,” the lawyers added. While McAfee criticized Willis in his ruling, Trump’s lawyers argued in their appellate filing that “the mere verbal rebuke of Willis by the trial judge was utterly insufficient — it demanded disqualification.” In rejecting the defense claim, McAfee wrote that Georgia law on so-called forensic misconduct is unclear in terms of the relevant standard for determining disqualification. That could make it more of an open question how the courts resolve the appeal, which has been set for oral argument in December. If Willis and her office are disqualified, that would raise questions of when or even whether the case could go forward with a new prosecutor’s office. Defending McAfee’s bottom line in keeping her on the case, Willis’ office wrote earlier this month that the judge didn’t abuse his discretion “in finding that none of the District Attorney’s statements were capable of permanently impairing the fundamental fairness of any future trial and that, as a result, disqualification was not appropriate.” To be sure, this disqualification issue is separate from the underlying substance of the case, in which Trump and others were charged a year ago for their alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election in the state. And there are other issues to resolve before the case can proceed to trial, including the effect of the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling. If Trump is elected in November, more attention may be drawn to his state criminal cases, which presidents don’t have the power to pardon or dismiss, as Trump’s lawyers try to overturn his New York state guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. But whether Trump wins or loses in November, the fate of the Georgia case may not become clear for some time.

"Trump howls as Harris, Dems turn him into the 2024 incumbent",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 11:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-howls-harris-dems-turn-2024-incumbent-rcna168276,"During the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters didn’t literally describe Donald Trump as an incumbent, but it was a message the party was eager to convey. Over the weekend, the former president added text to the subtext. “Kamala and her ‘handlers’ are trying to make it sound like I am the Incumbent President,” the Republican whined early Saturday at 1:15 a.m. He’s not the only one who’s noticed. TPM’s Josh Marshall summarized: I can appreciate why this is exasperating to the GOP nominee and his supporters. Harris is, after all, the incumbent vice president. She’s also the candidate offering American voters a breath of fresh air and a “new way forward,” as the Democrat put it in her convention speech. To a very real degree, Trump brought this on himself, pretending he won the 2020 race, asking that he be described as “Mr. President,” meeting with foreign officials as a matter of course, banishing the word “former” from his title, etc. But there’s more to it than that. As Off Message’s Brian Beutler noted in his latest column: Quite right. Trump grudgingly exited the White House in January 2021, but in the months and years that followed, he not only retook control of his political party, he also remained a dominant voice in the American discourse, en route to cruising through GOP primaries and caucuses, becoming his party’s presidential nominee for the third consecutive cycle. As a legal and official matter, the Republican has no more authority than you or I. He can’t sign or veto bills. He can’t issue executive orders. He is a private citizen with no powers to speak of. But it’s hardly unreasonable to conclude that we’re mired in the Trump era of American politics. And that, in turn, is precisely why Harris has an advantage as the candidate of change. The message to the electorate couldn’t be more straightforward: 2024 offers a unique opportunity to bring the Trump era to an end and usher in something new."
Senate candidate Royce White says suburban women voters are for suckers,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 10:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/royce-white-podcast-suburban-women-rcna168254,"In a recent episode of his aptly named podcast, “Please Call Me Crazy,” GOP Senate candidate Royce White went on a chauvinistic rant demeaning women who live in the suburbs, and labeling Republican politicians who seek these women’s votes as “losers” who have a “cucked mentality.”  He doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo that Donald Trump and his campaign are trying — however haplessly — to soften their image with women voters. Or maybe White is outright defying it. The Minnesota Republican, who’s currently looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, is known for launching bigoted attacks via social media and his podcasts. In July 2023, for example, White told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon that women these days are “too mouthy.”  That remark came up again during a podcast episode released on Thursday, when White doubled down on his “mouthy” remark, claimed Republicans who try to win over suburban women voters are “delusional,"" said these Republicans would be better off caucusing with Democrats, and accused these Republicans of “living in a cucked mentality.” (The term ""cuck,"" in right-wing parlance, is another word for a man perceived as weak — particularly in their interactions with women). It’s worth noting, here, that just last week Trump publicly tried to woo suburban women during a speech that focused on crime. Awkward.  According to White: White said his “too mouthy” comments from last year pale in comparison to the things women are allowed to say about men these days. And then he truly went off the deep end with a chauvinistic rant claiming suburban women can “come along” with the hypermasculine MAGA movement only if they disabuse themselves of what he calls their “strange” psychology. Like many of White’s rants, this one descended into nonsensical schlock invoking geopolitics. He said:  No need to strain yourself trying to make sense of all of that. These are the ramblings of a man who seems to borrow his putrid takes from the darkest and most conspiracy theory-ridden bowels of the internet. And this contrived image of a suburban woman who purportedly tends to overspend on goods simply because they benefit children in Africa is a product of that delusion. But White wasn’t finished.  He continued:  Perhaps, now, it’s starting to make sense why I suspected White’s candidacy might prove disastrous for Minnesota Republicans. He’s never won a general election himself, yet he seems oddly confident the way to do so — in a state with a popular incumbent senator, no less — is to publicly demean suburban women, whose aversion to the GOP’s anti-abortion extremism and its Trumpian character more broadly already seems to be causing trouble for the party’s election hopes.

Jack Smith reportedly won’t seek a ‘mini-trial’ in Trump’s Jan. 6 case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 10:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-mini-trial-trump-jan-6-election-interference-rcna168195,"Special counsel Jack Smith reportedly isn’t planning on seeking a so-called mini-trial in Donald Trump’s federal election interference case before the November election. I’ll explain what that means and why that isn’t the crucial issue in the broader context of the prosecution and Trump’s criminal cases generally. The context that prompted speculation about such a hearing is the Supreme Court’s July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States, which laid out a vague test for presidential immunity that now falls to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to apply, to see how much of Trump’s indictment survives the high court’s ruling (an issue that may well return to the justices for review of her decision before any trial can happen). The question is how Chutkan will seek to accomplish that complex task: With just written briefs? With briefs followed by an expansive hearing featuring witness testimony? It’s not clear yet. The parties have a joint status report due to Chutkan on Friday about how they want to proceed, after Smith notably requested more time to finalize the government’s position, with Trump’s team unsurprisingly agreeing to the further delay. Ahead of that status report coming due, Bloomberg News reported Friday that Smith “has decided against seeking a major hearing to present evidence in the election-interference case against Donald Trump before voters go to the polls,” and The New York Times similarly reported that federal prosecutors “now appear unlikely to seek a broad public airing of their evidence in a courtroom before Election Day.” The reports, which cited people familiar with the matter, have not been independently confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC. But if true, this news isn’t too surprising. After the immunity ruling, it became even clearer that no Jan. 6 trial was going to happen before the election. As shown most recently by Smith requesting more time to determine his position on how to proceed, the government seems to understand that there’s no use in rushing now. So what’s the public missing out on if there isn’t such a hearing before the election? One answer seems to be that voters could learn even more about Trump’s actions after the 2020 presidential election that led to the indictment. (He has pleaded not guilty.) But Jan. 6 isn’t a whodunit. Whatever happens in this criminal case, Trump’s behavior that day is well documented and has been broadcast for all to understand. A federal court hearing (which wouldn’t be televised, by the way) could add more details, but anyone inclined to pay attention has long had abundant information available to them that should make the matter clear for electoral purposes, one way or the other. Perhaps it would be worse politically for Trump if, in the days leading up to the November election, there were additional daily reports of his antidemocratic behavior on this score. But that political issue isn’t the issue in court. The bigger legal issue is that if Trump wins the election, then his federal cases are as good as gone. (Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the former president’s federal classified documents case, to which Trump has also pleaded not guilty, with Smith’s appellate brief due Tuesday.) Voters are free to consider that electing Trump again would mean that he’d never face federal criminal trials for Jan. 6 or his allegedly unlawful retention of classified documents and obstruction. (With state cases, presidents can’t dismiss them or issue pardons; Trump’s lawyers are arguing that the immunity ruling should cause his New York guilty verdicts to be reversed, while his Georgia state case, in which he has pleaded not guilty, is tied up on a pretrial appeal unrelated to immunity.) And the immunity ruling isn’t the only recent high court decision implicating how Trump’s case in Washington moves forward. Another one that Trump’s lawyers will press is Fischer v. United States, in which the court narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. Two of Trump’s four charges in his Jan. 6 indictment are obstruction-related, so even if the Fischer case doesn’t upend Trump’s prosecution to the extent that the immunity decision has and will, it’s yet another issue potentially complicating the case. Again, the case becomes uncomplicated if Trump wins the election, because he’d then be empowered to get rid of the case. In the meantime, of course, it isn’t fully up to Smith or Trump how the case proceeds. It’s up to the judge. We should learn more about where the case is headed when we see the report on Friday, with a status conference set for next week, on Sept. 5, that could shed more light on what’s next.

August 23rd, I’m Claire McCaskill and I’m here with my guest co-pilot today, the “Bulwark’s” one and only Tim Miller, which I’m excited about. He’s funny and he’s good and he’s smart and he used to be a Republican. He’s host of the “Bulwark’s” podcast, which is terrific. You should listen to it. He and Sam Stein did a thing on RFK’s trip with the bear carcass that I sent to everybody I know because I couldn’t stop laughing. Tim Miller: Well, that’s wonderful. That was, I think, the highlight of our whole oomph, so thank you. Claire McCaskill: Oh my god, it was so good. He’s also an MSNBC analyst with me. We traveled together to the debate in Atlanta to talk about that mess. And he’s the author of “Why We Did It,” a travelogue from the Republican road to hell. Good morning, Tim. Tim Miller: Hey, Claire. I was just saying to the suits last night, maybe don’t send me and Claire to the next debate. Maybe just one of us or maybe a new team, a new duo. I’m happy to go wherever, but just let’s change up the juju a little bit. Claire McCaskill: You know, I got to tell you though, I really remember walking away from the building and you telling me that your husband said that I went there and how glad he was that I went there the night after the debate. And when you said that, it was so oddly reassuring to me as somebody who has taken incoming for 40 years as a politician in a really tough state to get that kind of reassurance that I spoke my truth, but I knew a lot of shit was going to fly because of what I’d said. So you just giving me that little bit of reassurance as we were walking late that night was nice. And so tell your husband thank you too. Tim Miller: I will pass that along to him. And I’m happy about that because look at where we are now. We’re in the coconut grove -- Claire McCaskill: I know. Tim Miller: -- and we’re unburdened by what has been. Now, things are wonderful. Claire McCaskill: I’m F’ing drinking pina coladas. I don’t know about you, but it is -- Tim Miller: Same. Me and Jen Psaki we’re having a coconut cocktail last night around 2:15 a.m. Claire McCaskill: Perfect, perfect. We’re also gonna have Cedric Richmond. After Tim and I finished talking, we’re gonna have the former Louisiana congressman and a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair join me to spend a little bit of time unpacking from the campaign’s perspective, what they accomplished and what they are seeing down the road. But let’s first dig into how the week went. We got, you know, less than 75 days, 74 to be exact. I’ve been here since Monday. I thought it would be fun to talk about how it looked from the outside as somebody who’s been to a lot of conventions, certainly some on the Republican side, which I’ve never attended, and then how it felt like on the inside. So let’s start with you. Why don’t you give us what you think was your overall takeaway impression after watching this thing for a week? Tim Miller: Yeah. I mean, number one, you know, we can nitpick and talk about the goods and the bads, but just as a biggest picture, especially the last three nights, phenomenal. They had three weeks to turn this thing around from when she was the nominee. And it’s a lot harder than maybe it seems, you know, it’s like, oh, you have politicians, give speeches. Like there are a lot of pitfalls. And, you know, I think back to the Romney 2012 convention, which was the last Republican one where I was really in good standing with the party and like, we fucked up a couple of things, pretty bad excuse my language. Like there was the Clint Eastwood thing. There was one of the nights it had a weird theme. Claire McCaskill: Well, that was brutal. Everybody needs to remember that was that really bizarre thing. He was out there with an empty chair. (BEGIN AUDIO) Clint Eastwood: So. Mr. President, how do you handle promises that you made when you were running for election? Do you just, you know, I know people were wondering, you don’t -- (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: He was talking to the chair. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, that was not good, Tim. That was not good. Tim Miller: Yeah, I know. So there were multiple nights and Paul Ryan wasn’t really that good at driving a message. So anyway. Just being able to do the minimum in three weeks of drive a clear message, build up Kamala, explain what the contrast is between her and Trump and offer something that’s appealing to a broad swath of Americans. Like that’s a minimum bar and they just cleared it, I think with flying colors. The other thing that just really struck me especially as a former Republican was how much effort was put in across the board by every speaker up to and including the vice president and the presidential nominee to reach out to people from different perspectives politically to say, everyone is welcome here no matter if you’re a conservative. Barack Obama really focusing on how they’re good people, you know, you know these types of people in your life that have these American values and maybe they’ve been Republicans, but they believe in decency and respect and working hard and playing by the rules, all that sort of stuff. And it was in almost every speech, religious tones, focus on patriotism, USA chance, and it was really an effort that culminated in the vice president’s speech last night that said, this is a campaign for everybody and it’s also a campaign for the people in the room, for Democrats, you know, but we’re welcoming everybody to it. And just one observation on that, in her speech last night, she mentioned America or Americans 34 times. She mentioned the Democratic Party zero times. You know, it was really an intentional effort to be as broad and as big as possible and that really came through. Claire McCaskill: Well, and what a contrast between -- Tim Miller: Yes, oh my gosh. Claire McCaskill: -- our convention and the Republican convention, there was no effort. In fact, it was the opposite. Tim Miller: Yes. Claire McCaskill: You almost felt like if you were a woman, you weren’t welcome. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: The Hulk Hogan ripping the shirt, which was beyond weird. I think he was drunk, don’t you? Tim Miller: He was partying. I don’t know. It might just be CTE so, I don’t know. I’m not a doctor. Claire McCaskill: Well, there you go. And Trump coming in, it’s a man’s world and the fact that I have no recollection. There might have been some women speakers that I don’t remember women at all at their convention. Tim Miller: Certainly not the last night. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, no. So it was such a contrast of reaching out. And you’re right. It happened. Tim Miller: Just on that point, could you just imagine? It’s hard to even imagine in your mind a Republican speaker at that convention going up and saying, progressives love America too. Muslims love America too. You know what I mean? And that was happening, right, like we welcome it. There was just none of that. Not only was there none of it, you almost couldn’t even imagine it because it’s anathema to what they were arguing. Claire McCaskill: Right. Their whole thesis is America is dead and dying and everyone who doesn’t agree with us is horrible. And by the way, we know there are more of you out there. So if you believe in our view that America is in the trash can, come and hang out in the trash can with us and we’ll put everybody else in jail. Tim Miller: Yeah. I mean -- Claire McCaskill: Right? Tim Miller: -- in order to save Trump. Claire McCaskill: All about one guy. Tim Miller: Yeah, the Harris speech was basically, in this room, we love America as it is, the diversity, all of the different elements, the gumbo of America. You’ve got Cedric Richmond coming on and we want to do some work to make it a little bit better for everybody. They over there hate America as it is and are happy to tear it apart to just make Donald Trump’s life a little bit better. And the Trump convention played right into that. It was all about him. He sat up in the box. It’s like you almost could imagine him like in a royal box holding out his fingers for people to kiss, you know, as they come by. Claire McCaskill: He was like on a throne. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: He was seated in a white leather throne. Tim Miller: It was bizarre. Claire McCaskill: It was weird. Okay. So here’s the other thing I noticed. Besides the fact that we were very disciplined about reaching out, we also stole your shit. I mean, your former party shit, right? We stole it. We stole the flag. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We stole freedom and we even stole football. Tim Miller: Yes. Claire McCaskill: I mean, we now have the triumvirate. We have the three Fs. And I remember back in the day when I used to like meekly say, hey, could we spend more time talking about, you know, how we love America and we all go to church and all of those things. And we were so busy drilling down to the 14th paragraph of the policy that we were going to enact as it related to whatever policy thing we were doing that year that we never really got to that emotional place. And so everybody in the Republican Party who is saying, well, where are their policies? I’m saying I am so happy that we did not dwell on the details of our policy and actually drove a theme. Tim Miller: Same. And you mentioned, there’s a fourth F there, faith. Also, there’s a lot of references to -- Claire McCaskill: Faith, right. Tim Miller: -- kind of religious faith during this and comfort with it and the USA chance. Look, I was feeling this could have been a 1988 Reagan-Bush convention at times, not on the policy, but just on the thematic side of it, right, about American exceptionalism and excellence with a very modern twist, right? Like part of why it’s exceptional is Kamala Harris’s story, right? This could happen here, right? That we could have an immigrant mother -- Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: -- a single mother, mixed race, you know, woman taking this nomination. So his grandmother speaks with an accent, whatever the line was. So, that melding of kind of those chest-thumping patriotic themes that you hear from Republicans with, okay, but why are we chest-thumping? You know, this appreciation of diversity in the country. I thought it was really good. One other thing that was stolen, some of the foreign policy stuff, now some of the liberal listeners might get a little triggered by this, so just trigger warning. Some of the foreign policy stuff could have been from the McCain convention. (BEGIN AUDIO) Kamala Harris: I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-un who are rooting for Trump -- (CROWD CHEERING) Kamala Harris: -- who are rooting for Trump. Because you know, they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won’t hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: I mean, it’s just like standing up to autocrats, standing up to dictators, the dictators are rooting for Trump. I loved that line. They’re rooting for him. They want him to win because he wants to be a dictator. You know, standing up to Iran, standing with our allies, Ukraine against Putin. I’ve been saying this for a while because I went to about maybe about six months ago, I went to a briefing with the vice president and she was so passionate about this, America’s role in the world and our allies. And I’ve been saying to the never Trumpers, I was like, I don’t think you realize how strong she is on these themes. It doesn’t mean she’s going to be a warmonger or to save her rattling, we’re not invading Iraq, right? But I just like this notion of America has a positive role to play in the world and she wants America to be strong on the world stage. I thought she hit that out of the park for Nikki Haley voters, you know. That was really key I think. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that we are the leaders of the free world and it matters. And, you know, I know the overriding sense that she had about this speech. I know this. I know her, was to show strength. And when I heard her use the word lethal, I grinned from ear to ear. (BEGIN AUDIO) Kamala Harris: As commander-in-chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. (CROWD CHEERING) (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: Because the word lethal in the context of our military is exactly the kind of terminology she should be using. And anybody who watched that speech and thinks that somehow she’s some kind of shrinking violet in front of world leaders, I mean, that just disappeared, instantly disappeared. So quickly before we go to a break. I’d like you to pick on Monday, who was the best speaker on Monday? Who was the best speaker on Tuesday in terms of moving the ball? Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Use the coach’s metaphor. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We’re trying to move the ball down the field. Who were the best speakers each night to move the ball down the field? Tim Miller: Okay. The first night I think was probably Jasmine Crockett. I thought AOC was also pretty good on Monday, even though that wasn’t my politics. I thought she gave an objectively good speech. (BEGIN AUDIO) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: In Kamala Harris, we have a chance to elect a president who is for the middle class because she is from the middle class. (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: Tuesday, I mean, it was the Obamas. It was just the two of them together. Michelle’s was probably better if I had to pick, but just they worked together. I mean, they were just going to work on that guy with like a blowtorch and pliers between the two of them. (BEGIN AUDIO) Michelle Obama: For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. (CROWD CHEERING) Michelle Obama: I wanna know, who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs? (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: It was amazing I thought. Harris obviously last night was the best of Kinzinger. I should shout out Kinzinger. (BEGIN AUDIO) Adam Kinzinger: I’ve learned something about the Democratic Party and I want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret. The Democrats are as patriotic as us. (CROWD CHEERING) (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: And the third night. Claire McCaskill: That would be Oprah. (BEGIN AUDIO) Oprah Winfrey: Common sense tells you that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect. (END AUDIO) Tim Miller: Oprah. Claire McCaskill: Oprah. Tim Miller: Thank you, yeah, Oprah. Claire McCaskill: Definitely Oprah. Tim Miller: Oprah was really good on the third night, though. I should shout out Wes Moore too. I thought Wes Moore was also really good on third -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Wes Moore’s really good. And I gotta tell you that I thought Doug Emhoff did a really good job too. Tim Miller: Sam. (BEGIN AUDIO) Doug Emhoff: And now that the country needs her, she’s showing you what we already know. She’s ready to lead. (CROWD CHEERING) DOUG EMHOFFF: And with your help, she will lead with joy and toughness with that laugh and that look, with compassion and conviction. (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: Because women of America fell in love with that guy at that moment. They saw how much he loved her. They saw a guy whose masculinity wasn’t threatened by not only taking a step back from his career, but just taking a step back and being there to hold her hand and tell everybody how great she is. And also the faith thing. It was obvious that this is a faithful Jewish man who is steeped in his faith. And I thought the way he wove that into the speech without it feeling like he was doing anything, but just telling you about how he grew up and why he loved her. It really was very good. And Walz was pretty good too. You know why I loved Walz? I loved Walz because he was 15 minutes long. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Who does that? Tim Miller: He was eight minutes shorter than Bill Clinton. (BEGIN AUDIO) Tim Walz: It’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal, but we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field and boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced and Kamala Harris is ready. (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: Okay. Tim Miller: It was good. Claire McCaskill: All right. So let’s take a little break here. We’ll pause and up next. Tim and I are going to look at what lies ahead for the vice president’s campaign post-convention and into the lion’s den of the next two months. We’ll be back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. My co-host, former Republican operative and “Bulwark” writer-at-large, Tim Miller is still with me. By the way, before we start what we got to do now, the campaign has to do now, my favorite line from a Republican was, if you vote for Kamala Harris, you’re not a Democrat, you’re a patriot. Tim Miller: Yes. Geoff Duncan. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Geoff Duncan. That was really a strong line. So what now? Tim Miller: Geoff Duncan was so good. I mean, I love Kinzinger, his speech was good. But Geoff Duncan, both of that, and the other thing, just one sentence on it, the line that his son told him, you know, it’s never the wrong time to do the right thing. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Miller: I’m taking that little line and I’m sending it to every Republican in my life that was like, where have you been? All right, there’s 70 days left. It’s never the wrong time to do the right thing. Like you can come out now. You can speak. There was a couple of Republicans, I think, that should have been speaking this week that weren’t. Claire McCaskill: I agree. Tim Miller: Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, Mark Esper, et cetera. So I’m hoping that some of them get off the sidelines. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Mark Esper should have been there instead of Leon Panetta. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, I love Leon and he did a perfectly great job and the message came through loud and clear, but it would have been better coming from Mark Esper. Tim Miller: Yes, absolutely. Claire McCaskill: Or even McMaster. Tim Miller: Yeah, any of them, any of them. Where were they? Where are they? John Kelly, what are you doing? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, where is John Kelly and Mattis? Where are they? I agree. All right, so what’s going to happen now? What do you think this addled brain that sounded like the neighbor down the street that’s weird that you can’t get off the phone when he called into Fox last night. What does Civita’s and Susie, what’s her name have? Tim Miller: Susie Wiles. Claire McCaskill: And Corey Lewandowski, what do they have in store? Tim Miller: I don’t know if you’re intentionally mispronouncing all three of their names, but I’m going to pretend that you are just as a troll. Claire McCaskill: I am. I am. Tim Miller: Unfortunately, well, not Lewandowski because he was never actually a strategist, but the other two I’ve worked with. Look, I mean, Trump obviously is freelancing a lot of this himself. I mean, last night he calls into Fox. He’s like hitting the keys by accident, like an old man on the phone. You can hear it beeping. So, you know, it’s not exactly a tight ship over there. And the speech in, I guess it was in North Carolina, he’s like pulling the crowd saying, my advisors want me to focus on policy, but I want to be mean, what do you think? And the crowd’s like, mean, you know. So, I don’t know. Does it matter what (inaudible) loves to be the one? Claire McCaskill: You can’t make it up. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You can’t make this shit up. You just can’t make it up. Tim Miller: No, it’s totally out of ideocracy and like, it’s just straight out of Hector or Mountain Dew Camacho. And so I think that Trump’s going to keep being Trump. So the question is, what’s Harris going to do? I mean, there are a couple of debates, right? And it’s keeping this same broad message, positive momentum going forward because, you know, it’s not like the Trumps have a secret plan up their sleeve. I mean, what’s going to happen is they’re going to run ads that try to turn her into socialist leftists from California and then Trump’s going to say mean things about her. That’s their campaign. Claire McCaskill: I would love it if the Harris campaign started pulling some tape of all the times Trump has said, I’m going to have a really good policy on that in two weeks. He does it over and over again. I mean, he told us he was going to get his healthcare plan that was going to be bigger and better and perfect in two weeks, back in 2016, and we still have not seen this elusive health care plan. He was just asked this week about medical abortions. Tim Miller: Yes. Claire McCaskill: And he said, well, there’s going to be some specifics on that, but generally, and he really tried to straddle it so hard, it made me hurt how hard he was trying to straddle to keep the extreme anti-choice folks happy, but knowing that politically, he couldn’t go there. And so he won’t even answer that question cleanly or plainly and yet they’re yammering about how we don’t have policy. I mean, I just think she should say, we’ll give you details on policy as soon as you show us your health care plan. Right? Tim Miller: Yeah, I just think that shows the weakness of all this. It’s like, yeah, like, what are you talking about? What’s Trump’s policy? Like, you had no platform four years ago. Trump’s policy is whatever, you know, comes out of his pie hole at any given moment. So, I don’t think that that is a real vulnerability. I think the more that the Republicans are hyperventilating and being like, Kamala hasn’t done interviews, Kamala has no policy, whatever. Just ignore that, stay focused. I thought she did just enough policy last night and she gave a clear economic policy message that was kind of in the Clinton mold, you know, very sort of middle class focused. The immigration, she did some immigration last night, she did some foreign policy. That’s all she needs to do. She doesn’t need to be putting out five page white papers. Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: Nobody cares about that. Claire McCaskill: Nobody cares about it. And frankly, this was usually our downfall. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Usually our downfall, that we get so caught up in the weeds that we forget the message. I got to just mention it just because I’m so happy today that I believe RFK is endorsing Trump. I mean, you know, it is like officially now Looney Tunes all the way around. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Do you think on any stretch this actually hurts Kamala Harris? The bear carcass man with the worm in his brain is going to go with his conspiracy theorist buddy, Trump. I mean -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- should she worry a bit about that? Tim Miller: I don’t think she should worry about it. I have a kind of two minds about this because RFK was a huge threat when Biden was in the race, right, because he was picking up a lot of the double haters. Those people have all coalesced around Kamala now. So in a lot of ways, having a smaller third party number is good because of the structural disadvantages Democrats have in the electoral college. If Trump has a ceiling of 47, 48, maybe at most, you know, you want to be able to get as high as possible, 51, 51 and a half. So just mathematically, I don’t think it hurts that much and I certainly, thematically, it doesn’t hurt having the anti-vax crazies all in one boat. I had a slight kind of wish that maybe RFK was going to cleave off. It was going to do like a reverse Jill Stein to Hillary to Trump, like kind of an accidentally hurt him by cleaving off like 1%. So, that’s the only downside, I think, to him endorsing. Claire McCaskill: So the operation on the other side -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- the counter-programming piece. I noticed their counter-programming yesterday, the advance team was so good, they walked into a bakery with Vance. The people there didn’t know who he was. He didn’t know what to say. The woman says, I’m J.D. Vance. I went for vice president. She goes, okay. Like -- Tim Miller: Okay. Claire McCaskill: -- it was -- Tim Miller: Cool bro. Claire McCaskill: They didn’t even -- Tim Miller: Can you turn the camera down? (BEGIN AUDIO) J.D. Vance: I’m J.D. Vance. I’m running for vice president. Good to see you. Unknown: Okay. J.D. Vance: We’re going to do two dozen. Unknown: Okay. J.D. Vance: Yeah. Just a random sort of stuff here. Just everything. Yeah, a lot of glazed here, some sprinkle stuff, some of these cinnamon rolls, just whatever makes sense. (END AUDIO) Claire McCaskill: They didn’t even have fillers. I mean, the basics of an advanced stop by in presidential is you have supporters as fillers. So there are people around that are looking adoringly at your candidate. And this guy looked like somebody get me out of here. Clearly, these people don’t like me and I don’t know what to say. I mean, what is going on over there? Tim Miller: Yeah, he’s bad at small talk too. And just contrast it with how awesome the advance was of the Harris-Walz event in Milwaukee where they cut from the convention up to Milwaukee -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Miller: -- and it just looked amazing in their full stadium. So what are they doing? Well, I think that Trump is lazy and tired and old. And so he’s only doing like two or three events a week and he barely even leaves his house. I mean, he has two press conferences, one at Mar-a-Lago, one at Bedminster in the last two weeks. So what they have is Vance doing a lot of heavy lifting as far as multiple events a day, going out there, going to the swing states, trying to get local news coverage. The problem with that is that he’s not that good at this. Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: Pretty awkward. People don’t like him. He’s off-pudding. He’s grumpy. And so I think that the theory of the case is, okay, well, we’re going to work J.D. who’s young and we can tell him what to do and get onto the local news in all these various markets and fly him around. But the downside of that is you’re going to have these awkward encounters because he’s J.D. Claire McCaskill: And now they’re viral. You know, back in the day, you had one bad stop by, you know, he would get buried pretty quickly. But what’s going on now -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- organically in social media, and this isn’t the campaign. These are folks out there that are talented, the content creators that were treated like heroes at our convention. It was really interesting. They had their own rooms. They had their own lounges. They had their own podium. I mean, it was all about these content creators and I had a bunch of them come up and talk to me and I recognized, you know, once they told me what the handles were, I recognize these people -- Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- but I’d never met them, of course. And they were all there and they’re all creating this stuff and the campaign doesn’t have to do anything. Tim Miller: Yeah, no. And J.D. makes it easy on them. Claire McCaskill: He does. Okay. So let me ask you this. Do you think they’re smart to continue to bang on Project 2025 or are we spending too much time on it and should we let it go or should they continue to try to make this the boogie man that America should be afraid of? Tim Miller: I think it’s good. The way they’ve done it is they’ve kind of put some pretty traditional democratic attacks underneath the Project 2025 label and I like that as a strategy, you know. And so I think that that works and I think that just focusing on the extremism, you know, the extremism of the people that would go work for Trump is compelling. Claire McCaskill: The last thing I wanted to talk to you about today before I let you go, because I know you’ve got lots to do and I’d like to get home and go to bed. I’m still in the hotel room in Chicago. So here’s the thing. I don’t really know if Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can continue to be the cheerful warriors with all the incoming. What would be the big pep talk you would give them if you were in the room with them? Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: What would you tell them that they needed to make sure they did what to win every single day for 74 days? Tim Miller: Yeah. Well, look, I think they can continue to be happy warriors. I love how they’ve had the kind of brush off the shoulder response to the racist and gross attacks on the family. You know, you could get defensive, get bogged down in that, and the Republicans are gonna be gross. They’re gonna go after Tim Walz’s kid. They’re gonna say Kamala Harris just turned black. And like, they should be called out from that by all of us. But the campaign really, I like they kind of laughing at it, diminishing it. You can talk about how pathetic and sad it is. So I think that’s a way to kind of continue to have the happy warrior image. I think we have two jobs basically over the next 70 days. One is continue to activate the base voters. These people that haven’t paid as close of attention, younger voters, you know, voters of color in particular that like don’t watch MSNBC, right? Like the people that just are not as engaged in the news. How are you getting them excited for Kamala Harris? That is going to mean getting Taylor Swift out there, you know, doing the stuff, getting the TikTok’s, working with these influencers, right? Like she’s gotta keep that momentum going for 70 days as having this be a cultural movement. Simultaneously, rhetorically, I always use as my North Star. In Georgia in 2022, Brian Kemp, the conservative governor, won in a pretty landslide. Raphael Warnock won in a landslide, right? There was like 15% of Georgia that voted for Brian Kemp and Raphael Warnock. These are people that have traditional values. A lot of people voted for you back in the day, Claire, that type of person. Claire McCaskill: Right. Tim Miller: And I think this convention, a lot of the messaging was reaching out to that person. All that stuff we’re talking about, faith, freedom, patriotism, they got to keep doing that and, you know, rhetorically. And so sometimes those two things are intention, right? Like how do you excite the base while also reaching out to the Brian Kemp voter? I think that’s like their big challenge and they’ve managed it pretty good so far. And I think that’s what they got to be focused on. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. It’s called persuasion versus getting your folks to vote. Tim Miller: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And that is the tension of the last 60 days. Well, I hope that we have a chance to talk either again on this podcast or maybe on the air about the wonderful fundraiser that Trump is having for the J6 criminals at Bedminster. Tim Miller: I don’t get it. And speaking of one more thing you’ve stolen from the Republicans, we’ve. I can call us we now. The police, she was out there going, he sent rioters to attack police, right? So yeah, we can talk about that more. Claire McCaskill: All right. Well, you’re the best. Thank you for joining me today. I know you were busy this morning. Former Republican operative now on the side of the force and the force is with him. He’s the host of the “Bulwark” podcast. If you haven’t listened to, it’s really good. And author of “Why We Did It: A Travelogue from the Republican Road to Hell.” Thanks a bunch, Tim. Tim Miller: Thanks, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Up next, we’re going to have Cedric Richmond, the former Louisiana congressman and a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair join me to spend a little bit of time unpacking from the campaign’s perspective what they accomplished and what they are seeing down the road. We’ll be back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. Now that Tim Miller and I have laid out how the convention was perceived, both in person and on screen, I wanted to get a perspective from inside the campaign. How are they feeling? What are they excited about? What are they worried about? And joining me now for an inside look is the perfect person to discuss this with, Cedric Richmond. He’s the former Louisiana congressman and former advisor to President Biden, and he is now a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair. Welcome Cedric. I’m really honored you’re here. Cedric Richmond: Thank you, Senator, for having me. Claire McCaskill: You bet. So I just got to start and I know I’ve already tweeted something at Stephanie this morning. People don’t really know about the talent behind the scenes that make the production value of conventions. Excellent. But man, that was really well done, Cedric. The campaign should be really proud of that convention. I think a new gold standard has been set. Cedric Richmond: Well, I’ll tell you, I think that it starts at the top. Minyon Moore was an excellent chair. Stephanie Cutter coming in to do the production and then Alex’s CEO, our executive director. I think not only was it a great production, but you have to realize three weeks ago everything changed on what the convention is and what they had to produce. And so they probably did this in two and a half weeks and I think that they pulled it off. It was a miracle but it just goes to show the talent that they have. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and I think the other thing the convention did, which is so good for our party, is that we showcase the talent that we have on the bench from local officials to law enforcement officials to just regular folks that contributed and then all of the members of Congress and the senators and the governors and the other statewide officials. And Cedric, how did you get them all to be so disciplined about message? I have never seen that kind of discipline from folks who run for office before in my life. Cedric Richmond: Well, some of them were more disciplined than others. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Cedric Richmond: But in the general sense and theme, I think that most people realized how serious this is. So they stayed on the messages that they wanted to deliver. But the other extraordinary part, and Senator, I think you were dead right in your assessment, was how broad the speakers were from very young people to law enforcement to veterans to teachers to ordinary Americans that just want something different. And I think that the entire convention was wrapped in love of country and I think that that’s going to resonate and I think that people are going to recognize what’s at stake. Claire McCaskill: Are you at all worried? It is so smart the way that every night of the convention, the message came through loud and clear, come join us. If you love your country, come join us. We don’t care what party you have been or you are. We don’t care how you feel about any certain issue we just want you, because of the values of our country, to join us at this important moment in this really delicious, diverse coalition of folks that want to stop a really dangerous guy from stepping back in the Oval. Are you worried that the base is, I mean, you guys got to do two things, right, over the next two months? You’ve got to keep the base at a fever pitch to drive out a high level of voting amongst our traditional coalition, but you also have to keep persuading people in these swing states. They’re called that for a reason because they have voters that go back and forth from Democrat to Republican, from Democrat to Republican. How are you going to manage that tension over the next 60 days? Cedric Richmond: Well, on the turnout and the GOTV and enthusiasm, I think that we continue to try to build it. We’re not under the illusion that you’re gonna keep this excitement up from a convention all the way to Election Day. So we expect it to go down and then we build back up with Election Day as the goal. And to the extent that we have early voting and voting by mail wrapped up in between, we will continue to reach out and inspire those voters to get involved. And so the way I look at it is you have to inspire people and you have to remind them, why bother go out and vote? Why bother wait in line? Why bother do all of those things? And really you do that by answering the question, what’s in it for me? And we’ll continue to do that. And then we’ll continue to make our case to undecided voters that there’s a place for you in this party, but at the end of the day, this administration will wake up every day, trying to figure out how to make your life better. Claire McCaskill: It was artfully and deftly done that so many speakers took apart Donald Trump without ever saying his name. It was remarkable. The Obamas did it. Oprah Winfrey did it. Tim Walz did it and the vice president did it. And one of the ways that is happening is through the use of Project 2025. How big a piece is 2025, that project, going to have in the paid advertising? Do you see that as a continuing vessel for the anti-Trump stuff without going after him personally? Cedric Richmond: When we need to draw contrast with our policy versus his, that’s what we will go to. And elections are about contrast. And it’s a binary choice between two people and we’re gonna make that case and we’re gonna continue to show the dangers of Project 2025 and how for most American families, it is very detrimental. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and he is really trying to weasel away from it, but I think you guys even have video of him, don’t you, at that dinner? I know you’ve got the transcript of what he said at the dinner in April of 2022 when he said just straight out, they are putting together the framework of what we’re going to do in the next administration. I just hope you guys don’t let him weasel out, which I know you won’t. There are so many good people on the campaign. I mean, you are part of an amazing team. I don’t think there’s ever been a team put together quite like this since I’ve been around politics and I’m old, Cedric. I’m really old. Okay. So were you worried about not giving uncommitted delegates a chance to speak? Was there a lot of discussion about that? I know it had to be a difficult decision, and I know that everyone is taking very seriously the concerns that so many in our party have about what is going on in Gaza in terms of the innocent lives that are being lost. Is there anything you can tell us about that decision and how it was made? Cedric Richmond: Well, we want to hear from everybody in the party, but you know, and I know that this convention came together very quick with a bunch of moving parts. And to the extent that Vice President Harris has strong opinions on what’s happening in the Middle East, we wanted it to be her voice. We wanted her to address the issue. And we take all our delegates seriously. And the one thing I will say is we took uncommitted seriously. But it just didn’t happen that they were on the platform and that they had to speak. But I think what was most important is that the American people got to hear from the person that will be in the Oval Office, the person that will set the policy on what she believes, what she wants and where her values are. Claire McCaskill: I’ve had people that have said to me, you know, I would volunteer, but you know, I just don’t know that I want to do what they’re going to ask me to do. And I don’t know that I want to knock on a stranger’s door. Can you just briefly let folks know about the variety of things that you could do as volunteers that it doesn’t require that you go door to door and knock on strangers doors? I’m afraid we’re losing some foot soldiers because they think the only thing that people are going to ask him to do is something that they’re just uncomfortable with. Cedric Richmond: Well, look, it is a very divided country and it’s very volatile time. I understand that. I understand their concerns, but there are multiple ways to do it, some are through official ways of going and volunteering in a campaign. Look, there’ll be states like Louisiana, which is my state, which will be a donor state. We’re going to register people to vote with all of our activity and most of our energy will be geared towards those states that will decide this presidency. And that’s the blue wall of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And then we’ll go out to the sunbelt, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, all of those states. So what you could do is anytime you’re just home and you’re really feeling antsy about this election, you could go to the headquarters, pick up postcards and drop postcards to everybody, you know, that lives in those states because one, they will see how serious it is to you that you took the time to drop them a postcard. But the truth is you could call them, you can text them, you can e-mail them. But we just have to remind people what’s at stake and we have to make sure that we take this excitement and we turn it into action. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I have a grandson that’s starting at the University of Wisconsin next week and I told him, listen, you need to transfer your registration to Wisconsin, which you certainly legally can do. There’s no issue with that whatsoever. And people need to think about that. Are there college students in your world that are going to school in one of those states? I mean, we do voter stuff on campuses, obviously, but there are many kids that just keep their registration at home. And if they’re from a bright blue place and they’re going to school in one of the battleground states, they need to move that registration. And isn’t it fun that we got North Carolina on the map, Cedric? Cedric Richmond: North Carolina’s on the map. Claire McCaskill: It’s on the map. Cedric Richmond: And I had to go back the other day to realize that President Obama won it, so. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, absolutely. Cedric Richmond: We know what to do. We know how to do it. And I think with that gubernatorial race going on over there, that’s as much contrast as you can ever have, so -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Cedric Richmond: -- I’m excited about North Carolina. And look, in four years, I think we’re going to have more states in play. And so it’s continued to grow the map for us into purple states and continue to articulate our values. And I think that between our coach and our VP, we have a wonderful team. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, we do. I’m glad you’re on it and I’m really, really honored and glad you took a few minutes to spend some time with us this morning. Tell everybody on the team that they really did a great job this week, especially all the folks on the team, Cedric, that don’t get the public love. You know who they are. You know the ones that are running digital. You know the ones that they know their way around because they started working in campaigns when they were teenagers. Tell all those kids for me how proud we are of them and their commitment to this cause. Cedric Richmond: Well, certainly, we’re doing that. We’ll also tell you that keep doing what you’re doing. It’s critically important. We’re so proud of what you’re doing and it makes me very happy that as a freshman legislator, I went out to campaign for you and your re-election bid. So, you know, things happen for a reason, but you are where you are and I think you’re going to help us save this country. Claire McCaskill: Well, listen, there’s a lot of karma in this thing and I think maybe, I mean, I know it’s negative and I’m not supposed to say this in this campaign, but I’m not on the campaign so I can say it. I just want you to know the ultimate karma is Donald Trump getting dusted by Kamala Harris. Cedric Richmond: Absolutely. Claire McCaskill: That is great karma and you helping me back in the campaign and you helping me out this morning shows you got a lot of good karma coming your way too. Cedric, thanks so much for your time. We really appreciate having you. Cedric Richmond is a former congressman from Louisiana, former advisor to President Biden, and now a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair. Cedric Richmond: Thank you.

Colorado’s Dave Williams becomes latest GOP chair to be ousted,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 9:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/colorados-dave-williams-becomes-latest-gop-chair-ousted-rcna168239,"Former state Rep. Dave Williams’ tenure as chairman of the Colorado Republican Party was already a mess before the summer began, but things went from bad to worse a couple of months ago. Indeed, it was in early June when the state GOP chair issued a call to burn all Pride flags, at which point several local party officials decided it was time to show Williams the door. Two months later, they appear to have done exactly that. Colorado Public Radio reported: The vote was not close, though it is apparently being contested. In fact, after the vote to remove Williams as the state Republican Party chair, the Coloradan dismissed the meeting as “illegal“ and “illegitimate,” claimed that he was still the state GOP chair, and said the matter would actually be resolved by a separate vote at a different meeting. His reaction suggests a legal dispute is inevitable, which probably isn’t what party officials want to see as the election season takes shape. I won’t pretend to know how, when or whether this will be resolved, but the circumstances sure are familiar. Earlier this year, for example, the Republican Party of Michigan removed Kristina Karamo as state party chair after months of infighting and weak fundraising. Karamo claimed the votes didn’t count, and as of the weekend, she’s still asking the courts to reinstate her. Soon after, the Republican Party of Florida removed Christian Ziegler as its state party chair after he faced allegations of rape and video voyeurism. Two weeks later, Republican Party of Arizona Chair Jeff DeWit resigned following the release of a dubious audio recording of a conversation he apparently had with failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. A month after that, Ronna McDaniel resigned as chair of the Republican National Committee after losing Donald Trump’s support. Taken together, just this year, three state Republican Parties have ousted their chairs, one state Republican Party’s chair quit, and the Republican National Committee’s chair also quit. All of which is to say, things could be better in GOP politics. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Monday’s Campaign Round-Up, 8.26.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mondays-campaign-82624-rcna168226,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released new fundraising data over the weekend, and the totals are impressive: The Democratic nominee and her partners have raised $540 million for the general election, including $82 million during the Democratic National Convention and $40 million on the heels of Harris’ convention speech. * Though Donald Trump probably doesn’t want to hear this, the television ratings for the Democratic convention outpaced the totals for the Republican convention, and Harris’ speech drew a larger audience than the former president’s convention remarks. * NBC News reported late last week, “Nebraska voters will weigh two different abortion-related constitutional amendments this fall, with the secretary of state’s office certifying both measures Friday to appear on the ballot.” * In Alaska’s U.S. House race, Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom had Trump’s backing, but she nevertheless finished third in a multicandidate field. On Friday, she ended her candidacy, setting up a contest that will pit incumbent Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola against Republican Nick Begich III. * Still searching for an effective line of attack against Harris, Trump has repeatedly complained in recent days that the vice president thanked her supporters too much last week. * In Pennsylvania, a state judge concluded late last week that Cornel West’s third-party presidential campaign is ineligible for the state’s 2024 ballot. * The Harris campaign tapped Yohannes Abraham, the U.S. Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to help lead its presidential transition team. * And while Election Day 2024 is still 10 weeks away, the Associated Press reported, “In just two weeks, Sept. 6, the first mail ballots get sent to voters. ... And early in-person voting will start as soon as Sept. 20 in some states.”"
"Lawyers from Reagan, Bush administrations endorse Harris in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 8:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/lawyers-reagan-bush-administrations-endorse-harris-2024-race-rcna168217,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his presidential campaign on Friday and threw his support behind Donald Trump’s Republican candidacy. Time will tell whether this affects the 2024 race in any meaningful way, though at face value, the significance of the developments seemed limited: The independent conspiracy theorist has never held public office. His notoriety comes from being a lawyer with a famous name. Around the same time as Kennedy’s news, however, some lawyers who lack famous names made a notable endorsement of their own. Fox News reported: “We endorse Kamala Harris and support her election as President because we believe that returning former President Trump to office would threaten American democracy and undermine the rule of law in our country,” the lawyers wrote in a letter that the signatories shared first with Fox News Digital. The signatories added that “we urge all patriotic Republicans, former Republicans, conservative and center-right citizens, and independent voters to place love of country above party and ideology and join us in supporting Kamala Harris.” The same joint statement went on to remind the public, “Donald Trump’s own Vice President and multiple members of his Administration and White House Staff at the most senior levels — as well as former Republican nominees for President and Vice President — have already declined to endorse his reelection.” “Trump’s attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after losing the election proved beyond any reasonable doubt his willingness to place his personal interests above the law and values of our constitutional democracy,” the Reagan and Bush administration lawyers added. “We cannot go along with other former Republican officials who have condemned Trump with these devastating judgments but are still not willing to vote for Harris. We believe this election presents a binary choice, and Trump is utterly disqualified.” They concluded that the GOP nominee is “guilty of grave wrongdoing to our Constitution, democracy, and rule of law, and who remains unfit, dangerous, and detached from reality.” The endorsement from Friday came on the heels of Harris also picking up a variety of other Republican endorsements and Democrats including some GOP speakers at the party’s convention in Chicago. Indeed, Friday’s bookend endorsements were emblematic of the broader message the Harris campaign wants to convey to the electorate: Trump picked up support from a fringe anti-vaccine activist, while the Democratic nominee received support from lawyers from Republican administrations who want to put country over party. For Democrats pushing the “normal vs. weird” message, the developments were entirely on-message."
‘I’m not going to be afraid anymore’: How Biden’s plan for undocumented immigrants will change lives,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 8:07 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/m-not-going-afraid-anymore-bidens-plan-undocumented-immigrants-will-ch-rcna167593,"When Krysta Heard was just 3 years old, she made the dangerous journey on foot from Guerrero, Mexico to the U.S. Traveling through the California desert with her mom, aunt and cousins, Heard's family was looking for a better life, especially after her older sister, Cristabell, tragically passed away. “She died from a lack of access to clean water and sanitation,” said Heard, who is now 38 and lives with her husband and 4-year-old son in Denver. “This event altered the lives of my entire family ... It was pivotal in our immigration journey. After I was born, the goal [of my parents] was to give a new generation a safer life.” In 2016, at the age of 29, Heard became a beneficiary of DACA, the Obama-era action that protects young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. However, because the DACA program has been on consistent life support (several state courts have tried to overturn it, and the program was even temporarily rescinded by the Trump administration in 2017), Heard has continually feared that she could be separated from her family at a moment’s notice. But thanks to a new immigration measure set forth by President Biden, Heard has renewed hope that she will finally be able to adjust her status and receive a green card to become a permanent resident.  In June, Biden unveiled the executive action that would offer protection to undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens, as well as streamline work visas for DACA recipients and college graduates. The announcement marked the 12th anniversary of DACA. The move came after Biden implemented a crackdown on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Under Biden’s new “parole in place” program, non-citizens and DACA recipients like Heard, who are married to U.S citizens, will have the opportunity to apply for permanent residency without leaving the U.S. The new immigration measure is one of two policy directives from the Biden administration’s “Keeping Families Together” program. The parole in place process — which began accepting applications this week — could impact over 500,000 undocumented spouses, 90,000 of whom are DACA recipients, according to immigration advocacy group, FWD.US.  Until this point, there have been a number of deterrents that have kept non-citizens from filing applications to adjust their status. That includes the possibility of being barred from entering the country for up to 10 years, said Karen Tumlin, a civil rights lawyer and founder of the non-profit organization, Justice Action Center. “Sometimes they have to wait outside of the country for 10 years, or permanently when getting their green card… This [new] program can allow some of them to get what’s called parole, and then be able to get a green card [while staying in the U.S].” Heard said she started the process to become a permanent resident eight years ago. She was told to travel back to Mexico for a consular visit without a guarantee on the length of time she’d have to stay outside of the country – or if she’d be able to return at all. “That consulate appointment comes with a lot of surprises and risks. Many families like mine were all cleared to go, and never returned for one reason or another … This was not a risk I was willing to take,” said Heard. For example, one immigrant mother who applied for a green card through her U.S-born husband, found out she was banned from the U.S. for a decade when she went for her consular visit in Juarez, Mexico. “This executive order will allow me to have that interview here in the U.S., instead of in Mexico. After that, I can begin the pathway to citizenship,” Heard explained. Lizbette Vazquez, 34, who is currently undocumented, also said Biden’s new immigration program could be a gamechanger. In 2005, Vazquez moved from Guadalajara, Mexico to Pomona, California right after she turned 16. She said she immigrated to the U.S. with her parents to escape rampant crime in her hometown. Vasquez worked hard to get good grades, went on to college, and worked two jobs: tutoring in the mornings and working at a butcher shop to pay for her studies. She wanted to apply to the DACA program — which launched in 2012 — but was disqualified because she entered the U.S. just weeks after her 16th birthday. The DACA program requires beneficiaries to have arrived in the country by the age of 16.  Vazquez could benefit from the second measure of the President’s immigration program, which aims to streamline and expedite work visas for DACA recipients and undocumented citizens who missed out on the DACA program but are college graduates or students. Vazquez, who is a nurse and has been working as an independent contractor, said she will finally have options to adjust her legal status after almost two decades of living in the U.S. “It took me longer here in the U.S. to get my degrees, but I managed,” said the mom of three. “It was not free as my school loans are not forgiven and very expensive. Now I have two degrees and I just want to legally be able to work in a hospital and care for my patients.” Up until now, work-sponsored visas have been a tough sell for undocumented immigrants, as they require them to leave the country for an undetermined amount of time and receive a waiver to be readmitted to the United States, explained Dan Berger, an attorney at Cornell Law School’s Path2Papers Project, and advisory board member of the Presidents’ Alliance on Immigration & Higher Education. Biden’s immigration measure also gives Dreamers the ability to speak to their employers, or potential employers, about work sponsorship as a way to adjust their legal status. Under Biden’s new directive, consular offices abroad will shorten the amount of wait time for these waivers from months to just days or weeks, according to Tumlin. “It basically gets rid of some of the bureaucratic hoops that you have to jump to in order to get yourself to an employment-sponsored visa,” she said. Ultimately, Berger advised anyone who thinks they qualify for Biden’s new program to get a basic legal screening with a lawyer. Berger has helped a number of DACA recipients obtain work-sponsored employment. He explained there are a number of work visas available that some DACA recipients could qualify for beyond the more well-known H1-B employment-based visa. That includes visas such as the O-1 Visa for immigrants with extraordinary abilities (like doctors or Ph.D. graduates), the R-1 Visa for religious workers, or the E-2 Visa for business owners. As for how long Biden’s new immigration program will stay in place — especially amid the possibility of another Trump term — is still up in the air, said Tumlin.  But for now, immigrants like Vazquez and Heard said they will take advantage of the new immigration policy and are ecstatic they finally have a pathway to citizenship. “I’m not going to be afraid anymore,” said Vasquez ... And my family is going to be able to stay together.” Daniela Pierre-Bravo is a journalist, author, and founder of Acceso Community — a mentorship program for professional women.

The problem(s) with Paxton’s new election investigations in Texas,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-paxtons-new-election-investigations-texas-rcna168209,"Ken Paxton, Texas’ scandal-plagued attorney general, launched a couple of election-related investigations last week, both of which are controversial for different reasons. Last week, for example, Paxton’s office executed search warrants in the San Antonio area, alleging irregularities. Soon after, as a New York Times report explained, a Latino civil rights group asked the U.S. Justice Department to open an investigation into Paxton’s efforts, which targeted Latino voting activists and political operatives: The DOJ hasn’t yet said whether it’ll pursue the matter, and the Texas attorney general has claimed his recent raids had merit, but the simmering controversy is likely to continue. Paxton’s other election investigation in the Lone Star State is considerably weirder. The Texas Tribune reported: Evidently, Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo — whose conspiratorial perspective is difficult to defend — published an item to her social media account on Aug. 18, claiming that a friend of hers has a friend whose wife allegedly saw people registering immigrants to vote outside DMV offices. Despite the obviously flimsy nature of the claim, the host peddled the story on the air soon after, telling viewers that the immigrants in question were “illegals.” The Texas Department of Public Safety wasted little time in debunking Bartiromo’s claims, explaining that the claims were “simply false” and “kind of racist.” The chairman of the Parker County GOP agreed that the reports were “erroneous.” Nevertheless, three days after Bartiromo published her third-hand rumor online, Paxton’s office announced it was opening an investigation into “reports that organizations operating in Texas may be unlawfully registering noncitizens to vote.” Last week, a statewide poll from the University of Houston Hobby School and Texas Southern University’s Jordan-Leland School found Donald Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris in Texas, but only by about 5 points. The same poll found Republican Sen. Ted Cruz with a two-point lead over Democratic Rep. Colin Allred in the state’s U.S. Senate race. It was against this backdrop that Gabriel Rosales, Texas state director for the League of United Latin American Citizens, told the Texas Tribune that he viewed Paxton’s investigation as an act of intimidation to keep Hispanic voters from voting. Republicans “ see the writing on the wall,” he said. “They know that if the Hispanic vote comes out, they lose.”"
