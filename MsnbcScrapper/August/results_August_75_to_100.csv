Why Trump’s ‘incident’ at Arlington National Cemetery matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 6:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-incident-arlington-national-cemetery-matters-rcna168577,"In modern American politics, the vast majority of officials in both parties have taken care to treat the military, service members and veterans with respect. Donald Trump, for reasons that defy comprehension, has chosen a radically different path. Over the last decade or so, the Republican has reportedly denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers.” (He denies doing so.) Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, reportedly disparaged wounded veterans, blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, downplayed the importance of traumatic brain injuries suffered by soldiers, feuded with Gold Star families, downplayed the significance of the Medal of Honor, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, “I like people that weren’t captured, okay?” But a different aspect of his disrespect for those who wear the uniform was on display this week. Despite his record, the former president, seeing a possible campaign opportunity, appeared eager on Monday to exploit the third anniversary of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghans. This included attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, quickly followed by a thumbs-up photo-op at a gravestone in Section 60 of the cemetery, where many service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. If we were to stop the story here, it would already be the basis for a legitimate controversy. Indeed, Esquire published a memorable headline alongside a Charles P. Pierce column this week: “How The Hell Was Trump Allowed To Use Arlington National Cemetery As A Campaign Prop?” But that was before the story managed to get even worse. NBC News reported: The details of what transpired are still coming together. NPR reported, for example, that a source familiar said two members of Trump’s campaign staff “had a verbal and physical altercation” with an official at Arlington National Cemetery, but that hasn't been independently confirmed by MSNBC or NBC News. Other relevant details, however, are clear. “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,” the statement added. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.” I’m mindful of the fact that multiple reports emphasized that Trump was at the cemetery at the invitation of some family members who lost loved ones in Afghanistan three years ago. That’s apparently true. But while those family members deserve respect and sympathy, politicians still aren’t supposed to exploit Arlington to advance their personal ambitions. For its part, Trump communications director Steven Cheung denied any wrongdoing and accused an Arlington National Cemetery official of “suffering from a mental health episode” during the incident. Cheung didn’t deny that the former president was accompanied by a photographer at Section 60, but he insisted the photographer was allowed to be there. Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita added that the cemetery official was “despicable.” I don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this story, but as it progresses, it’s hard not to wonder what the political world’s reaction might be if a Democratic candidate were caught up in a similar controversy. How many GOP officeholders would call for him or her to quit the race?"
Jack Smith’s targeted indictment faces a bigger test than immunity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 6:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-trump-superseding-indictment-supreme-court-immunity-rcna168567,"We may never learn if special counsel Jack Smith’s new indictment passes the Supreme Court’s immunity test. If Donald Trump wins a second term in November, he’ll be empowered to end the prosecution that accuses him of breaking the law in trying to overthrow the last election. The superseding indictment filed Tuesday more closely conforms to the Republican-appointed majority’s broad grant of presidential immunity last month, which didn’t exist when the special counsel initially brought the case last year. But while the new indictment puts Smith in a better position to take Trump to trial, the biggest obstacle the government faces isn’t a legal one but the political question of whether Trump will take office again, which would put him in position to thwart the case. But even if Trump loses, the Supreme Court could still decide that Smith’s new indictment doesn’t meet its recently created test. The next major step is for U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to apply the vague immunity test to the new indictment. It’s unclear what precise form that analysis will take — including whether there will be a hearing in addition to written arguments, or what such a hearing would entail. Before the superseding indictment issued Tuesday, Chutkan had set a Friday deadline to hear from the parties about how they want to proceed, and she had set a Sept. 5 status conference to discuss the case. A court filing from Smith accompanying the new indictment said that “the Government will confer with the defense and make a joint proposal, to the extent possible, regarding pretrial litigation in the status report due Friday.” Like any defendant, Trump needs to be arraigned on the superseding indictment, though whenever that happens, he would not necessarily have to appear in court for it. (He has, of course, pleaded not guilty, which is why the case is still proceeding.)  But even if Chutkan rules on the immunity test’s application to Trump’s new indictment before November — a complex task, to be sure — the Supreme Court can still have the last word on whether it thinks the trial judge correctly applied its vague test. The justices weren’t in a rush to decide the initial immunity appeal; don’t expect them to speed up any review as the election nears.  The new indictment can’t overshadow the reality that a Trump victory in November could moot the issue, legally. If elected, Trump could try a legally untested self-pardon or just order his newly installed attorney general to dismantle the case. The Justice Department also has a policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. (Presidents can’t pardon or dismiss state cases, however.) It’s an open question whether the Supreme Court would agree that Smith’s more-targeted indictment passes its immunity precedent, as well as the high court’s other recent Jan. 6 decision, Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants. Trump still faces the same four charges in the new indictment, including two obstruction-related counts. In a footnote in the immunity ruling, which came out after Fischer, Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion said, referring to the relevant obstruction statute: “If necessary, the District Court should determine in the first instance whether the Section 1512(c)(2) charges may proceed in light of our decision in Fischer.”  But we’ll only learn the answer to that question if Trump loses.

"Trump claims he’s agreed to debate Harris, but there’s a catch",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 5:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-agreed-debate-kamala-harris-election-campaign-2024-rcna168568,"Following a mind-numbing process, featuring multiple reversals, Donald Trump issued an unexpected announcement by way of his social media platform: The on-again, off-again ABC News debate against Vice President Kamala Harris is back on again. “I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a Debate with Comrade Kamala Harris,” the Republican wrote in his predictably juvenile and whiny style. “It will be Broadcast Live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.” In the same online missive, the former president claimed that “the Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate” — I’ll never know why he capitalizes random words — suggesting the candidates’ microphones will be muted except when they’re answering questions, just as the Republican's team had hoped. So, all’s well that ends well? Not exactly. As is too often the case, when it comes to his own candidacy, Trump is an unreliable narrator. The New York Times reported: A Harris campaign official also confirmed with NBC News that negotiations are still underway over microphone rules. In other words, the GOP nominee told the public that the debate over the debates had been resolved, which came as something of a surprise to members of Team Harris, who knew better. For those who might benefit from a refresher, Trump initially agreed to a debate schedule three months ago, which included a Sept. 10 event on ABC News. That, of course, was when the former president assumed his opponent would be President Joe Biden. After the Democratic incumbent passed the torch to Harris, Trump abandoned his “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping and took a variety of clumsy steps to back out of his earlier debate commitments. In fact, three weeks ago, Team Trump made what appeared to be a categorical announcement: The GOP candidate would not participate in ABC News’ Sept. 10 presidential debate. Seven days after backing out of the debate, however, Trump reversed course and re-accepted the invitation. Around the same time, the former president held a Mar-a-Lago press conference in which he also announced the dates of other upcoming debates that hadn’t been negotiated and therefore might not occur. Two days later, on Aug. 11, Trump published a middle-of-the-night missive to his social media platform, further alerting the public to a made-up debate schedule, pointing to events that no one had agreed to. Earlier this week, the former president took all of this in an even weirder direction, signaling his newfound reluctance to participate in the Sept. 10 debate. As members of his campaign team worked behind the scenes to keep microphones muted during the event, the Republican candidate himself said he didn’t much care either way, necessarily undermining his own team in public. He added that he believed ABC News should be “shut out” of the process. Two days later, Trump agreed to the terms of the ABC News event — but he did so in a way that wasn’t altogether true. All of which is to say, the first Harris-Trump debate could be two weeks away, or it might not happen at all. The GOP nominee told the public that the underlying disputes had been resolved, but he apparently made that up, and negotiations over the relevant details are still ongoing. I’m reluctant to guess whether the event will actually happen, though one thing seems obvious: The former president was desperate to share a stage with Biden, and he appears genuinely afraid of Harris. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Kamala Harris is right to not make her race and gender a rallying cry,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-policy-identity-trump-attacks-rcna168255,"Vice President Kamala Harris has embraced a variety of vibes during her still nascent 2024 campaign, but one area where she restrains herself is discussing her race and gender. She doesn’t mention it much on the campaign trail. During her nomination speech at the Democratic National Convention, she declined to call attention to those identities outside the typical introduction politicians give when describing where they come from. In recent campaign ads, Harris is described as the middle-class “daughter of a working mom.” The class description renders her ordinary, and there is no attempt to pique interest over the historic implications of her candidacy as a woman of color. Harris’ reluctance to draw extra attention to her womanhood or her Black and South Asian ancestry has stood in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. At the Democratic National Convention that year, a video screen displayed a montage of all past presidents, and then Clinton emerged to the sound of shattering glass. “I can’t believe we have just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet!” she said in the video, prompting the crowd to erupt into roars. During her nomination acceptance speech, she wore a white pantsuit in a nod to the suffragettes, and she trumpeted how her nomination marked a “milestone” for women. Clinton’s most memorable campaign slogan, “I’m With Her,” highlighted her gender — and nothing else. Harris’ choice to go a different path is wise — and she should stay the course. The uniqueness of her identity as a presidential candidate is self-evident, and she should continue to let Republicans, who’ve come up with a preposterous new birther theory, hang themselves with their own rope with their bigoted fixation on her gender and racial background. But beyond tactical questions, Harris’ lack of interest in drawing attention to the “historic” nature of her candidacy is substantively appropriate, too. Harris’ victory wouldn’t in and of itself usher in widespread change for people from marginalized backgrounds. Only policies can do that. This isn’t an argument that Harris should conceal or whitewash her identity. Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, should feel free to discuss and cherish any aspect of her background, just as any citizen in our multicultural democracy should feel free to. And if the context calls for it, it makes sense for her to elucidate how her identity helps explain her ideological outlook. Harris did this artfully in her DNC speech by recounting how her mother, a “5-foot-tall brown woman with an accent,” was sometimes mistreated but “never lost her cool” and taught Harris to “never complain about injustice but do something about it.” Her recollection of another lesson from her mother hints at her own “show, don’t tell” attitude toward discussing her identity: “‘Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are.’”      "
Trump’s golf club honoring the villains of Jan. 6 is on brand — but no less disgusting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/j6-awards-gala-trump-golf-club-rcna168530,"Next week, the private golf club that former President Donald Trump owns in club in Bedminster, New Jersey, is scheduled to host a “J6 Awards Gala” to celebrate not the people who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but the people who attacked it. Trump isn’t expected to attend, according to reports, even though the Stand in the Gap Foundation, the organization that’s behind the event, boasts that it’s invited him to speak. But Trump doesn’t have to speak for us to link him to this event. It’s being held at a property he owns, and he has been very vocal in his support of the people who brutally attacked police officers in an assault on the Capitol. Last year, he spoke at a fundraiser held at the same golf course in support of the insurrectionists, and he’s hailed the attackers as “patriots” and vowed to pardon them, including those “who assaulted officers.” And even if he isn’t there Sept. 5,  the event’s website promises speaking appearances from Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and former adviser Peter Navarro, who served three months in jail for refusing to comply with the House Jan. 6 committee’s investigation. According to the event’s website, “the J6 Awards Gala … will honor and celebrate the twenty defendants who contributed to the powerful ‘Justice For All’ song” and celebrate “all J6 defendants who have shown incredible courage and sacrifice.” A presidential candidate letting his property be used to host an event where a mob attack on police officers will be celebrated as heroic is blood-boiling. As for the “Justice for All” song, which Trump has his supporters stand for at his rallies, we know the identities of many of the singers from a May 2023 Washington Post report: Texan Ryan Nichols, according to the Department of Justice, drove to the Capitol based on the “belief that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.” Nichols, who pleaded guilty to two felonies, including assaulting law enforcement officers, was wearing body armor as he “delivered two streams” of pepper spray “hitting multiple law enforcement officers.” Nichols also urged his fellow attackers to enter the Capitol with him, and yelled, “If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!” He was sentenced to five years in prison. Before he traveled from Texas to the Capitol, Shane Jenkins, another Texan, posted, “I have some sog tomahawks and tactical blades can I take those?” on social media. He was convicted at trial of eight felony charges and sentenced to seven years. Prosecutors say he pulled a “Sog” brand metal tomahawk axe out of his bag during the siege and used it to break windows. He then “riled up the crowd, telling other rioters, “Bro, we’re going in that f--- building one way or another” and “We paid for it; it’s our f--- building.” Prosecutors say he “hurled nine different objects at the officers” protecting Congress that day. Officer Brian Sicknick was one of the people pepper-sprayed by Julian Khater, another one of the singers of the “Justice for All” song. Khater pleaded guilty to “assaulting law enforcement officers with pepper spray, causing bodily injury to the officers.” Sicknick died the next day. Sarah McAbee, the organizer of this J6 awards gala, is married to Ronald Colton McAbee, a former Tennessee sheriff’s deputy who was sentenced to nearly six years in prison for assaulting police officers with “reinforced knuckle gloves.” Even more despicably, McAbee held down a police officer who’d been “knocked to the ground, kicked and stripped of his baton by other rioters,” enabling the crowd to viciously beat him. Not only are these the people Trump has promised to pardon and the people whose rendition of the national anthem he thinks deserves applause, they’re the people who’ll be celebrated and valorized at Trump National Golf Club. The Jan. 6 attack — as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves said when he testified before Congress in January — was “likely the largest single-day, mass assault of law enforcement officers in our nation’s history.” Graves made it clear that many more than the 140 officers originally reported suffered physical injuries that day — which, as he added, does not even include the scores more who suffered mental trauma. And we’ve horrifically seen several officers die of suicide in connection with what they endured on Jan 6. What Trump is doing and has done is not “treason,” at least not according to the letter of the law. But he has repeatedly provided “aid and comfort” to those who waged the first violent attack on our Capitol since the war of 1812, when the British set it on fire. Trump doesn’t belong back in the White House; he belongs in a prison cell just like the people who will be celebrated next week at the awful Jan 6 gala at his country club. "
The prosecutor populism of Kamala Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 4:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-campaign-proposals-prosecutor-rcna168232,"Vice President Kamala Harris is leaning on her decades as a local and state prosecutor to signal her toughness in the presidential race. But that professional experience also shapes her approach to tackling the country's problems. Consider inflation, which has been one of the Biden administration's thorniest political problems. In a speech this month, Harris proposed going after grocery chains that she claimed are using inflation as a pretext to price-gouge consumers. In one line in the speech, she outlined an approach that you might call prosecutorial populism: target the rule-breakers. “Most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case,” she said. You can see echoes of this approach in Harris' Democratic National Convention acceptance speech and other policy announcements: In each case, Harris clearly identified villains and proposed, essentially, prosecuting the cases against them. The benefits of this approach are that it's easy to explain to voters and it forces the political opposition to defend some pretty indefensible behavior. There's a reason defense attorneys have such bad reputations, after all. The populist approach would be to go after the large conglomerates in unflinching language — “every billionaire is a policy failure,” for example — but this prosecutor’s populism is narrower. The large companies breaking the rules are the target, and the solution is to go after them and leave the rest alone. There are limits to this approach. Sometimes a problem doesn't have a clear villain. Sometimes focusing on the people explicitly breaking the rules overlooks the broader problem that the rules created in the first place. Sure, scammy for-profit colleges are bad, but they aren’t the major reason student debt has become such a crippling problem. The prosecutor's mindset can also lead to a focus on easy wins. Being a prosecutor is an inherently political job, but it has much different set of incentives from other positions such as governor or senator. At the local and state levels, prosecutors are typically elected, and many look at their win-loss ratios in court as the best way to persuade voters to re-elect them. That can make them risk-averse, looking for cases with overwhelming evidence or seeking plea deals to avoid the uncertainty of going to trial. That could be a problem for Harris in the White House, where presidents often have to make snap decisions with incomplete information, such as when Barack Obama approved the late-night mission to kill Osama bin Laden. America has had presidents who were prosecutors before. Both James K. Polk and William McKinley got their starts as local prosecutors, and Bill Clinton was Arkansas attorney general before serving as governor. But Harris' experience is much deeper: She was a deputy district attorney, district attorney and California attorney general for 27 years, while she has been a senator and vice president for only seven years. Other presidents have been shaped by their past careers. Ronald Reagan approached the presidency like another acting gig and viewed political problems through the lens of Hollywood screenplays. Obama sometimes sounded like he was still a constitutional law professor, debating with himself whether the president has the power to mint a trillion-dollar coin. And former President Donald Trump still thinks like a real estate developer, promising to build walls and airports and statuary gardens. Harris has leaned heavily on her past as a prosecutor, promising to make the case against Trump, using “for the people” as her campaign slogan and talking about her handling of difficult cases to signal toughness to voters. It has also been used against her, as when some on the left criticized her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign with the meme ""Kamala is a cop."" But based on her policy announcements so far, it's clear that being a prosecutor is more than just a credential for Harris. It's also a mindset that she'll carry with her into the White House."
‘It Ends With Us’ was already problematic. Blake Lively’s press tour made it worse.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/colleen-hoover-blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-booktok-rcna168452,"When Colleen Hoover self-published her first young adult novel, “Slammed,” in early 2012, she was living in a single-wide trailer with her husband and three sons. She made $30 in royalties and was thrilled: It was enough to pay the water bill. Hoover didn’t have a publisher, an agent or a sweeping media tour. She didn’t have rave reviews from book critics at The New York Times or The Atlantic (and she still doesn’t). But less than a year later, “Slammed” made it to the New York Times bestseller list. Since then, Hoover has published 26 novels, outselling James Patterson and John Grisham combined. Hoover’s success is partially due to a literary industry now dominated by women — women readers, women publishers and women authors. According to a 2023 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, women publish more than half of all novels today, and they sell more books than the average male author. This is a relatively new phenomenon, of course. In conjunction with access to the birth control pill, safe abortion and higher education, women’s book publishing exploded in the 1970s. The rest of Hoover’s success is due to passionately loyal fans who evangelize for her on book-centric corners of the internet, including BookTok and Bookstagram. In 2022, well over a million viewers watched TikTok user Eloise Hampson’s tearful time-lapsed videos chronicling her emotional reactions to reading “It Ends With Us” — clutching the purple-and-white cover of the novel. Posts on CoHo, Hoover’s internet nickname and corresponding hashtag, will often involve tears. CoHo continually holds a spot as BookTok’s top read. It’s a chicken-and-egg question: BookTokers know CoHo content will generate likes, views and maybe even a viral payday. Whether or not they actually like her books comes secondary. “It Ends With Us,” Hoover’s top-selling and most literary novel, centers on a florist named Lily Bloom who finds herself at the center of a complicated love triangle between her protective first love and her abusive husband. It starts like a classic romance novel — chance encounter, slow-burn flirtation, passionate sex scene — and shifts to a serious look at abuse. “It Ends With Us” grapples with domestic violence with an intimate partner, generational cycles of abuse, identity, family and love. But many people reading this will know that already. The movie adaption, starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, premiered in early August and quickly exposed a dilemma. As massive as Hoover’s online cult following has become, BookTok culture and fandom did not translate well to a mainstream audience. The book’s Hollywood treatment began with side-eye from Hoover’s BookTok legion for casting choices — particularly for Lively. The media tour was marred by controversy: Questions swirled over a possible cast dispute between Lively and Baldoni, and Lively was lambasted for the way she answered media questions regarding the sensitive topics the movie addresses, namely domestic violence. One particularly damning TikTok on the movie’s promotional page shows Lively, in full glam makeup and wearing a Dauphinette skirt set and chainmail top, cheerfully advising fans to “grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.” Hoover is perched beside Lively in a purple floral Tommy Hilfiger dress appearing to endorse Lively’s tone-deaf messaging. Other choices have irked Hoover’s fan base. Last year, in the lead-up to the film, Hoover announced the release of a coloring book based on the character of Lily Bloom. After immense backlash, Hoover, and her publisher, Atria Books, canceled the publication. The movie drove new potential readers, who aren’t swayed by the powers of BookTok, to pick up their own copy of “It Ends With Us.” The result was an onslaught of fresh criticism for the novel. Readers slammed it as anti-feminist, misogynistic and glamorizing domestic violence. Particularly detrimental is the way the novel romanticizes the cliché dangerous-but-charismatic leading man and its blatant disregard of red flags that, off the page, often mean the difference between life and death for people in abusive relationships. Hoover’s books, for all of their wide-reaching success, are largely critically panned. Hoover’s writing style is juvenile and unpolished, and her dialogue is neither realistic nor particularly creative. But what Hoover does masterfully deliver again and again is emotional intensity, satisfying climactic moments — and lots of sex. Hoover’s writing reads like fan fiction. Although the genre existed well before the advent of the internet, its popularity exploded on chatrooms, message boards and literary subculture websites in the early aughts. Fanfic, a genre unto itself, is generally defined as amateur writers exploring different stories from the original source material (see: every iteration of ""Harry Potter"" romance imaginable on reading platform Wattpad), but now, fanfic as an adjective is synonymous with easy to read, hyperemotional, shallow and crass. There is a long history of disregarding literature written by women for women as vapid and inherently nonliterary. Last season on the ""Velshi Banned Book Club"" podcast, I wrote and produced an episode dedicated to defending so-called chick lit. If a woman enjoys a book, that is justification enough. “It Ends With Us” certainly exists in that space, and the literary merit of the book comes well below the book’s cultural relevancy. Hoover’s books aren’t popular because the writing is so good or the characters are so interesting or the dialogue is so engaging; they’re popular because of internet inertia. The rise of women readership, the normalization of fanfic and the command of BookTok has made for the perfect wet and dark environment for CoHo to thrive. Culturally, for a certain, growing demographic of women, Hoover has become a touchstone, a shared part of society, that is all but required for internet fluency and in-the-know conversation. Hoover proves, with her books and soon-to-be fleet of movie adaptions, that virality, buzz and internet adoration doesn’t equal quality (or taste). Hoover’s problematic writing and behavior still bear a cultural impact. Will this ultimately negatively affect Hoover’s overall success or following? When it comes to BookTok, online lit culture and book sales, definitely not."
Obama’s social media warning had Musk’s and Zuckerberg’s names written all over it,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/obama-dnc-social-media-musk-zuckerberg-actblue-rcna168512,"Happy Tuesday. Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, a grouping of top stories from the past week found at the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Former President Barack Obama’s cutting, suggestive joke about Donald Trump’s obsession with … crowd … size seems to have been the most widely shared clip from his rousing speech last week at the Democratic National Convention. I certainly found it funny. But I don’t think that should overshadow his critical comments about social media and the provocateurs in the political sphere — like Trump — who use such platforms to sow division and enrich themselves. Hearing that, it was hard for me not to also think of Big Tech powerbrokers like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg; people who’ve either deliberately used their platforms to benefit Trump or whose platforms have been used by bad actors to try to help him. And knowing the role that social media played in Obama’s political rise, I always find it interesting to hear him speaking critically of the types of platforms he once used to reach the masses. Here’s the line: Trump’s tour of the bro-ey podcast circuit continued over the past week, as his campaign tries to woo (chronically online) young men.

Jack Smith files new indictment in Trump election subversion case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 1:29 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 27, 2024, 3:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-jack-smith-superceding-indictment-jan-6-election-case-rcna168502,"Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump in the federal Jan. 6-related prosecution on Tuesday. The superseding indictment presents the same four charges, albeit in a shorter indictment, against the former president. Smith explained in an accompanying filing that the superseding indictment was presented to a new grand jury that hadn’t previously heard evidence in the case and that it “reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States,” referring to the July 1 immunity ruling. In that ruling, the Republican-appointed majority said that Trump is absolutely immune for “core” constitutional acts, presumptively immune for all official acts but not immune for unofficial ones. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the trial court to determine what in the indictment survives the immunity ruling, a process that still needs to get underway. The latest indictment attempts to get ahead of that process by slimming down details from the initial indictment last year that the government thinks could have been objectionable under the immunity ruling. For example, in describing the alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, the superseding indictment emphasizes that Trump’s alleged co-conspirators weren’t government officials at the time and were acting in their private capacity. That emphasis wasn’t included in the initial indictment. Likewise, the special counsel's office removed from its list of unindicted co-conspirators an unnamed Justice Department official — believed to be Jeffrey Clark — whom the initial indictment said “worked on civil matters and who, with the Defendant, attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.” A joint status report detailing how the parties want to proceed is due Friday to the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan; Chutkan gave the Friday deadline before the superseding indictment was issued. Chutkan had extended the deadline after Smith asked for more time to formulate the government's position — time the Justice Department apparently spent getting this superseding indictment. While the new indictment may put the government in a better position to survive the immunity test, the Supreme Court will likely have the last word on the degree to which this superseding indictment can go forward to trial. That final determination won’t likely occur before November, and if Trump wins the presidency, he will be empowered to get rid of the case completely.

"In a critical year, we can't sleep on the GOP's state-level chaos",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-party-chaos-swing-state-election-rcna168488,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 26 episode of ""The Rachel Maddow Show."" In a presidential election year, all eyes, understandably, are often on the two major-party presidential campaigns. But in an election year like this, with just two months to go until the big day, may I also suggest that you do not sleep on what is happening in the states — because sometimes what’s happening in the states seems like it can’t possibly actually be happening.  Take what happened this past weekend in Michigan. On Saturday, former Michigan Republican Party chair Kristina Karamo was escorted out of the state GOP convention by police. As The Detroit News reports: Karamo was elected in 2023 and removed in January of this year. However, she refused to go. In February, a court ruled that she had been removed in accordance with party bylaws, but, as of this summer, she was still trying to get courts to reinstate her as Michigan party chairman. Did I mention that this is one of the most important states in the country for the presidential race?  We pay so much attention to how the two parties’ presidential campaigns compete against each other in various swing state polls, but it’s also worth noticing when things are absolutely bananas with one of the parties in those states. Not long after the Michigan Republican Party went to war with itself, a version of the same thing happened in Florida. Right after Michigan threw out their state Republican Party chair, Florida fired theirs too — following news reports that he was being investigated by police for allegations of rape. Police also said they were investigating Christian Ziegler for video voyeurism charges for allegedly illegally recording a sexual encounter without consent. They later cleared Ziegler of charges in both investigations. Then, right on the heels of that, Republicans in Arizona lost their state party chair after GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake released secretly recorded tapes of Jeff DeWit in which she said he was trying to bribe her. She also reportedly threatened to release more tapes of him. Then the national Republican Party lost its chair. Ronna McDaniel was pushed out — or resigned — apparently to make room for Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. Lara Trump’s experience for the job included ... being a singer. Additionally, she’s married to one of Trump’s sons — the blonde one. So that seems like a totally legit, noncontroversial, meritocratic choice for the leadership of the national Republican Party. This has all happened this year, in 2024: Michigan, Florida, Arizona and the national Republican Party all lost their leadership under embarrassing, if not terrible, circumstances, all in an election year.  Now it’s happened again, this time in Colorado. On Saturday, Colorado Republican Party members met to vote out the state chairman, Dave Williams, who they said was destroying the party. Williams is now refusing to recognize the validity of the vote to remove him — because of course. He called the meeting on Saturday “illegitimate.” As of Sunday, the day after they voted to fire him, Williams at least still had custody of the Colorado Republican Party letterhead, on which he released a statement that said his firing was a sham and he was still in charge. So you have one person who says she’s still the chair of the Republican Party in Michigan, who was escorted out of the state convention by cops this weekend, while fists flew. And you have another person, who says he’s still the chair of the Republican Party in Colorado, even after he was voted out by other Republicans.  Doesn’t it seem like a great idea to put these folks in charge of the whole country? Join Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

Jack Smith hits back at Judge Cannon's nonsensical ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 3:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-judge-aileen-cannon-classifed-documents-donald-trump-rcna168473,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 26 episode of ""The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell."" On Monday, federal prosecutors filed a brief urging an appeals court to reverse Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case against Donald Trump. Last month, Cannon, a Trump appointee, tossed out the case and ruled that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded.  Now, some things in the law are open to debate and reasonable disagreement and others are not. Every method of interpretation of the law — whether it’s text, history or precedent — is devastating to Cannon’s decision. Smith could go into the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back and he would still win this every day of every week. Smith acknowledged as much in Monday’s brief, using words like nonsensical, misguided, strained and erroneous to describe Cannon’s ruling. I’d pay good money to read the first draft of that brief because he probably used some words that weren’t quite so restrained.  The truth is, a first-year law student could dismantle Cannon’s opinion — frankly, even a pre-law student. You don’t have to go to law school to see the clear faults in her argument.  Just for starters, and this is a point Smith emphasized in his brief, in 1974 the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in the Watergate case. In that ruling, the judges took the very laws that Attorney General Merrick Garland cited for the appointment of Smith and agreed it gave the AG power to appoint a special counsel.  Cannon has argued the Supreme Court’s review of special counsel authority in that case was merely “dicta,” or a passing remark in the ruling that wasn’t necessary to the holding of the case. To put it mildly, that conclusion is nuts.  Cannon claims the special counsel was appointed illegally and therefore Smith has no authority to issue an indictment. Well, the same thing was true in the Richard Nixon case. Nixon argued the special prosecutor subpoena should be quashed — that it was outside the bounds of the law. But the Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that there are specific statutes that authorize the appointment of the special counsel, so the subpoena could not be quashed.  That’s just one of the many faults in Cannon’s ruling. With Smith’s brief now filed, I expect the 11th Circuit to reject her nonsensical opinion and get this case back on track. "
"Tuesday’s Mini-Report, 8.27.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tuesdays-mini-report-82724-rcna168511,"Today’s edition of quick hits. * A superseding indictment: “Former President Donald Trump has once again been indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss, an effort which culminated in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charges the former president with the same four counts he faced in the original indictment returned last August: conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.” * Consumer confidence: American consumers felt more confident in August as their outlook for the future improved. The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 103.3 in August from 101.9 in July. The index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.” * Difficult diplomacy: “President Joe Biden’s top Middle East adviser on Tuesday held talks in Doha with senior Qatari leaders on the efforts to complete a cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas as well as Qatar’s prime minister meeting this week with Iran’s president, according to a U.S. official.” * In related news: “Israeli forces rescued an Arab citizen of Israel during an operation in southern Gaza, the Israeli military said on Tuesday, more than 10 months after he was abducted alongside about 250 others during the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7.” * The latest Jan. 6 sentence: “The very first rioter to breach the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack was sentenced to more than four years in federal prison on Tuesday after telling a judge that he still believes Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election ‘to this day.’” * Zelensky’s plan: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that this month’s lightning-fast incursion into Russia — where almost 600 Russian soldiers have been captured so far — is part of a larger plan to end the war in his country.” * Once this case was assigned to a Trump-appointed judge in Texas, the lawyers probably should’ve just started preparing the appeal: “A federal judge in the Eastern District of Texas on Monday temporarily blocked a Biden administration program that allowed undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to apply for green cards without leaving the U.S.” * All is not well in Florida: “For years, L.G.B.T.Q. people planning a trip to Florida could turn to the official website for Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing organization, for resources on where to go, what to eat and where to stay. ... But sometime in the past few months, Visit Florida — a private-public, nonprofit partnership created by the Florida Legislature in 1996 — quietly took down pages with information for L.G.B.T.Q. travelers.” See you tomorrow."
Trump allies indicted in Arizona fake electors scheme get a 2026 trial date,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 1:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arizona-fake-electors-2020-election-trump-allies-rcna168466,"A judge in Arizona has set a Jan. 5, 2026, trial date for allies of Donald Trump who have been charged for their roles as fake electors in a scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. At a hearing Monday, Arizona Superior Court Judge Bruce Cohen scheduled the criminal trial to begin just one day shy of the fifth anniversary of the Capitol riots, though he called the 2026 date a “moving target.” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, in April announced the indictment of 18 Trump allies over their efforts to subvert the election results in the former president's favor. One of the defendants pleaded guilty this month, and another, lawyer Jenna Ellis, has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. The remaining 16 defendants who face criminal charges include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; Trump's former legal adviser John Eastman; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who is currently spearheading the Republican National Committee's ""election integrity"" efforts. All of them have pleaded not guilty. The Arizona case is so far the only state-level criminal prosecution related to efforts to steal the 2020 election that has set a trial date. Trump is identified as a co-conspirator in the Arizona case, but he has not been indicted. Defendants on Monday also tried to argue for dismissal of the charges by claiming that they infringed on their First Amendment rights, a defense that cites the state's anti-SLAPP law. Cohen has indicated that he is open to the defense, Politico reported. As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out, the GOP has consistently rewarded alleged fake electors in several states, elevating them to prominent positions within the party. Some have been renominated as Republican presidential electors in the November election, and others — including several Arizona defendants — were picked as delegates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July."

Why do Republicans keep forgetting who was president in 2020?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-keep-forgetting-was-president-2020-rcna168496,"Given Russia’s efforts to interfere in the United States’ 2016 presidential election, officials were on high alert during the 2020 race for similar tactics. With this in mind, when The New York Post published a notorious report on Hunter Biden’s laptop during the race four years ago, U.S. agencies suspected it was Russian misinformation. So did social media giants, which temporarily limited access to the story. Facebook was among the tech companies that acted, and Mark Zuckerberg has long said he wished his company had handled the matter differently. The CEO reiterated that point in correspondence this week with Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. Donald Trump apparently found all of this significant anew and published this missive to his own social media platform. For readers interested in punctuation and grammatical rules, I’d note that the former president’s rant started with quotation marks, but there was no end-quote. I’ve long since stopped trying to understand his idiosyncratic approach to the language. Nevertheless, as is often the case, Trump probably saw a headline or two, failed to grasp the relevant facts, and published some online hysterics that didn’t really make any sense. But of particular interest was a pertinent detail the GOP candidate overlooked: He was president in 2020, not Joe Biden. Look at the rant again: To hear Trump tell it, “the White House” was responsible for trying to suppress a controversial report, which in his mind, necessarily meant that the 2020 election was “rigged.” But in light of the fact that we’re talking about events that unfolded in 2020, he was referring to his own White House. It’s striking how often this comes up with Republicans. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia last year blamed the Biden administration’s policies for a Michigan woman whose sons died in 2020 — when Biden was a private citizen and Trump was president. Months later, Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas blamed Biden for “paying people to stay home” in 2020, referring to a law that Trump signed into law. The same week, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado blamed the Democratic president for Covid-related school closures in 2020 — which, again, was a year that Biden spent campaigning, not in the Oval Office. It also wasn’t too long ago when former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pointed to crime data from 2020 to blame Biden for the U.S. murder rate, apparently unaware that it was her former boss who was president at the time. More recently, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody took aim at the Biden administration’s approach to criminal justice protests in 2020 — when there was no Biden administration. Evidently, Trump is equally forgetful. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Judge halts Biden program that protects undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 12:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/judge-halts-biden-program-undocumented-spouses-immigration-rcna168387,"A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked a new Biden administration program that allows undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens to remain in the country with their families while applying for green cards. In the ruling Monday, U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker sided with 16 states that had sued the administration, writing that their claims against the program, called Keeping Families Together, “are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date.” The states all have a Republican attorney general. Undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens typically have to leave the country to apply for a green card, but the “parole in place” program allows them to remain in the U.S. during the process. The plan, touted as a key part of President Joe Biden’s pledge to “promote family unity” in the immigration system, was announced in June, shortly after the president signed a widely criticized executive order to limit the number of asylum-seekers entering the country when border crossings reach a certain threshold. The green card program was hailed as a bold approach that is more in line with his promise of a more humane approach to immigration policy. It was also seen as a potentially transformative move that could affect the November election. According to the White House, an estimated 500,000 people were eligible for the program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had begun accepting applications on Aug. 19. The 16 red states, led by Texas, sued the Biden administration Friday, arguing that the executive branch had no authority to grant such sweeping parole to undocumented immigrants and claiming that it “incentivizes illegal immigration and will irreparably harm” their residents. Notably, Barker wrote in his ruling that the stay applies only to federal agencies’ ability to grant parole in place. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will continue accepting applications for the program but that it will not be approving requests while the stay is in place."
Border-wall politics trips up Trump’s 2024 campaign (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 12:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-wall-politics-trips-trumps-2024-campaign-rcna168472,"A few months ago, Donald Trump boasted that during his term, he “built 571 miles” of border wall. The former president added that he was poised to add another 200 miles within a few weeks, concluding, “I built much more wall than I said I was going to build.” All of this was spectacularly untrue. In fact, every element of the Republican’s claims turned reality on its head, badly distorting the facts about an issue he appears to consider one of his top priorities. It was emblematic of the GOP’s broader problem with the debate over border policy: Reality keeps getting in the way of their campaign rhetoric. The Washington Post, for example, recently published an analysis of the party’s advertising, highlighting dozens of ads that criticize the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the border, “while showing chaotic scenes that were filmed in 2018 under the Trump administration.” One commercial in particular showed footage of Central American migrants in Tijuana rushing the southern border. The voice-over and text blamed Democrats for the unrest, which actually unfolded during Trump’s presidency. It was against this backdrop that the former president traveled to Arizona last week for a border-wall photo-op, though Team Trump apparently forgot to care about the details. The Post reported: There was a dramatic problem with the rhetoric: As the Post’s article explained, “This section of 20-foot steel slats was actually built during the administration of President Barack Obama.” In case this isn’t obvious, Democrats have never said border barriers are entirely unnecessary between the Pacific Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. There are high-traffic areas, party officials have long said, in which it makes sense to have structures to prevent illegal crossings. Throughout Obama’s term, it was not uncommon to build and repair barriers along these parts of the border. As of last week, Trump tried to take credit for some of the Obama administration’s work, either (a) hoping the public wouldn’t know the difference, or (b) cluelessly unaware of reality. Whatever the explanation, the Republican keeps trying to make a border wall the centerpiece of his bid for a second term, and he keeps tripping over it."
"Despite commitment, Trump hedges on scheduled debate with Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT / Updated Aug. 27, 2024, 12:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-hedges-presidential-debate-kamala-harris-election-2024-rcna168170,"UPDATE (Aug. 27, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET): Donald Trump on Tuesday, after calling for ABC News to be ""shut out"" of the presidential debates a day earlier, said he will participate in the network's Sept. 10 debate with Kamala Harris. UPDATE (Aug. 26, 2024, 1:24 p.m. ET): This story has been updated to include Donald Trump's comments to NBC News on Monday, saying he believes ABC News should be “shut out” of the debates and stating he would be OK with keeping microphones unmuted. Keeping up with Donald Trump’s positions on presidential debates has been like watching a misshaped ball bounce in unpredictable directions. As the post-convention general election phase begins in earnest, the problem actually seems to be getting worse. The Washington Post reported: Before delving into the Republican’s latest online tantrum, let’s review how we arrived at this point. In mid-May, Trump agreed to a debate schedule, including a Sept. 10 event on ABC News, when the former president assumed his opponent would be President Joe Biden. After the Democratic incumbent passed the torch to Harris, Trump abandoned his “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping and took a variety of clumsy steps to back out of his earlier debate commitments. In fact, three weeks ago, Team Trump made what appeared to be a categorical announcement: The GOP candidate would not participate in ABC News’ Sept. 10 presidential debate. And then things got even weirder. Seven days after backing out of the debate, Trump reversed course and re-accepted the invitation. Around the same time, the former president held a Mar-a-Lago press conference in which he also announced the dates of other upcoming debates that hadn’t been negotiated and therefore might not occur. Two days later, on Aug. 11, Trump published a middle-of-the-night missive to his social media platform, further alerting the public to a made-up debate schedule, pointing to events that no one had agreed to. By and large, much of the political world simply ignored the Republican’s odd rambling and remained focused on the Sept. 10 debate that both campaigns had agreed to — that is, until Trump published a new rant that put the future of that event in doubt. “I watched ABC FAKE NEWS this morning, both lightweight reporter Jonathan Carl’s(K?) ridiculous and biased interview of Tom Cotton (who was fantastic!), and their so-called Panel of Trump Haters, and I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?” the former president wrote. Trump went on to suggest Donna Brazile (whose name he misspelled) might secretly give Harris the debate questions; the vice president's “best friend” leads ABC News (I don’t know whom Trump was referring to); before concluding, in reference to George Stephanopoulos, “Where is Liddle’ George Slopadopolus hanging out now?” Obviously, making predictions based on Trump’s juvenile rhetoric is folly, but his screeds did not sound like a candidate eager to appear on a debate stage. Complicating matters further, Politico reported that the Harris and Trump campaigns are still negotiating the terms of the scheduled Sept. 10 debate, and one of the sticking points is whether the candidates’ microphones “will be muted when it isn’t their turn to speak.” According to the reporting, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, members of Team Harris want the microphones to stay on — in keeping with modern practices — because they assume Trump won’t be able to keep his composure for 90 minutes. “We have told ABC and other networks seeking to host a possible October debate that we believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast,” Brian Fallon, a senior adviser on the Harris campaign, told Politico. “Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. We suspect Trump’s team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit they don’t think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.” Where does this leave us? With a great deal of uncertainty about whether Trump and Harris will ever share a stage. In case this weren't already complicated, Trump denounced ABC News again on Monday morning, telling NBC News that ABC should be ""shut out"" of the debates. The Republican, as part of the same comments, said he doesn't care about the microphones issue — contradicting his own team — adding that his focus is on the networks. “I’d much rather do it on NBC,"" he said. ""I’d much rather do it on CBS. Frankly, I think CBS is very unfair, but the best of the group, and certainly I'd do it on Fox. I’d even do it on CNN; I thought CNN treated us very fairly the last time.” Trump went on to say that Harris ""doesn’t want to debate,” which was amusing given the circumstances."

Lawsuit against Georgia Election Board seeks to 'prevent chaos’ in November,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 11:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/georgia-election-board-rules-lawsuit-rcna168427,"In one of the latest legal fights brewing ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Democrats in Georgia have filed a lawsuit to prevent chaos and confusion in the battleground state. The petition against the State Election Board was sparked by two rules passed by the Republican-majority board regarding election certification, a process that should be straightforward but that the GOP has sought to complicate. The petition for relief, filed Monday in Fulton County Superior Court, seeks a court declaration that the rules are invalid, laying out the issue this way: The petition explains that under these two new rules, election officials in the state would have to (1) conduct a “reasonable inquiry” prior to certification and (2) allow individual county board members “to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.” One problem with the rules is that they suggest that certifying the election results is a discretionary process. But it’s a mandatory one, and any fraud or misconduct allegations are meant to be resolved in court through legal challenges, not by county boards during the counting process.   “To the extent either rule does allow election officials to delay certification or not certify — as the rules’ drafters avowedly intend — it is invalid,” the petition argues, seeking to “prevent chaos in November” by clarifying the issue now. Certifying election results shouldn’t be a contentious issue. But Republicans backed by Donald Trump have made it one recently, most notably culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol following the 2020 election that Trump lost to Joe Biden. Whatever the results of the coming election, a court order that makes clear the uncontroversial process of counting ballots should make it a less chaotic one.

Police endorsement for Gallego adds to Kari Lake's woes in Arizona Senate race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 11:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/ruben-gallego-kari-lake-arizona-senate-police-endorsement-rcna168435,"As far as endorsements are concerned, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is running up the score in his U.S. Senate race against Republican nominee Kari Lake.  Gallego has already flexed some of his bipartisan appeal in this race by touting dozens of endorsements he's received from Republicans, including sitting officials. Lake has tried to counter by promoting some Democrats who say they support her — though her group has lacked the local gravitas (i.e., name recognition) of Gallego's group. So Gallego’s endorsement from the conservative Arizona Police Association on Thursday adds to the pile-on. The organization, an advocacy group for law enforcement officers, has endorsed Trump in this election (a disturbing development, in my view) but apparently preferred to give Lake the cold shoulder in favor of her opponent, despite her fealty to Trump’s agenda. The organization touted Gallego's ability to secure funding for law enforcement nationwide and in Arizona specifically in the press release announcing their endorsement. ""As a Marine combat veteran, we know Congressman Gallego understands the complexities of modern policing in American society today, while at the same time recognizing the public's expectations,"" APA President Justin Harris wrote. (Harris is the guy you might have seen Trump urging offstage midspeech during a campaign stop in Arizona last week.) Of course, endorsements aren’t everything in a campaign. Neither are pre-election polls, which have generally shown Gallego with a pretty substantial lead in the weeks before early voting begins. Obviously, a win for Lake certainly remains a possibility. But the endorsements and the polls do measure ... vibes: They can tell us valuable things about how a candidate is being perceived or how well their strategy seems to be working. And in that sense, this latest APA endorsement seems like another indicator that Lake’s decision to mimic Trump’s tics and lines of attack aren't working for her. For example, as part of her election denialism, she’s attacked mail-in voting, which is used by a majority of Arizonans. She’s insulted fellow Republicans — including late Arizona Sen. John McCain — just as Trump has. And much like Trump, she’s often seemed more focused on promoting her personal brand and elevating her profile than on campaigning — so much so that earlier this year, even Trump reportedly expressed concern about how often she's at Mar-a-Lago. Other swing state GOP candidates for Senate have had to reckon with this reality, too, from failed Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz to former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler. And like them, it doesn’t appear to be a winning formula for Lake. When a Republican is so extreme or inauthentic that they turn off the Arizona Police Association, that’s a clear sign that it's time for a new strategy."
"Trump targets Harris, Walz with entirely made-up claims",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 11:19 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-targets-kamala-harris-tim-walz-claims-election-2024-rcna168458,"At a campaign event in Arizona late last week, Donald Trump spent a predictable amount of time targeting Vice President Kamala Harris, specifically telling his supporters, “Nobody lies like her. She is a liar. She makes up crap.” The Republican’s rhetoric was rather ironic. After all, the former president is not only the most prolific liar in recent memory, he makes stuff up on a daily basis. Indeed, minutes after insisting that the Democratic nominee “makes up crap,” Trump told the same audience that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “approved a bill to give tampons in every young man’s bathroom.” In reality, Walz did no such thing. In a speech in which the GOP candidate complained about campaign dishonesty, he peddled campaign dishonesty. Two days later, Team Trump released a campaign ad that insisted the Biden/Harris administration has “literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips.” As a Washington Post fact-check report explained, that didn’t happen. Note, this wasn’t an off-hand and unscripted comment at a rally; the Trump campaign carefully included this specific phrasing in a paid television ad. The Republican operation almost certainly knew the claim was baseless, but the former president and his 2024 team pushed it anyway. A day later, Trump spoke at the National Guard Association’s conference and took care to blame Harris for America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago, despite the fact that (a) it wasn’t Harris’ call, (b) Trump’s the one who negotiated the withdrawal agreement, and (c) his own White House national security adviser said Trump bears some responsibility for what transpired. All of which leaves the political world with an awkward question: If Harris and Walz are as awful as Republicans claim, shouldn’t Trump be able to make a compelling case against them without making stuff up? Shouldn’t it be easy for the GOP nominee and his allies to stick to reality-based critiques? Doesn't the fact that the former president has to rely so heavily on dishonesty reinforce the idea that maybe Harris and Walz aren’t so bad after all?"
Texas is the latest battleground in Trump's war against voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 9:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-ken-paxton-lulac-doj-rcna168224,"For years, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has easily ranked among the most destructively partisan and self-servingly venal elected officials in the country. And last week, he turned his sights on suppressing the votes of Texan Latinos this fall in the name of “election integrity.” On Wednesday, Paxton’s office announced that it had carried out an undisclosed number of search warrants in several counties, including the one that houses San Antonio. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America’s oldest Latino civil rights groups, says the raids targeted several of its members. In doing so, Paxton has tipped his hand about his determination to undercut voting rights this fall — and potentially made an enemy of the very people the GOP needs to win. Republicans have twisted the phrase “election integrity” since well before President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Rather than a dedication to ensuring that every vote is counted, the GOP has coopted it as a justification for suppressing legal votes while claiming to prevent election fraud. We’ve seen efforts in other GOP-led states set up by election security offices that have brought few charges and failed to prove widespread fraud exists. Paxton’s latest stunt goes further, though, indicating a newfound focus on suppressing the work of an organization rather than disparate individuals. His office’s statement last week asserted that the searches were the result of a two-year investigation of supposed “allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting” in the 2022 election but did not specify the targets of the raids or why specific homes were raided. The GOP wound up winning all of the counties where the claim that was sent to Paxton originated, but they are also in south Texas, a region that showed mixed results overall in the midterms. The second of the two potential crimes that Paxton is investigating — “vote harvesting” — is a particularly glaring sign that there’s most likely very little substance to these allegations. In using the term, the GOP tries to evoke the incredibly rare act of someone fraudulently collecting other people’s absentee ballots and casting those votes without their awareness. But in practice, Republicans are usually referring to two entirely legal practices: establishing secure ballot drop boxes or organizations’ working to ensure that senior citizens who are unable to make it to polling places have access to mail-in ballots. The latter practice appears to be Paxton’s target, based on details reported Monday in The New York Times. Lidia Martinez, an 87-year-old living in San Antonio, who was one of the people whose homes were searched, has worked for decades helping older Latino voters register to vote. She told the Times that the officers who turned up at her house in the early morning last week were looking for voter cards that Latino residents had filled out. Finding none in their ransacking of her home, they took her laptop, her phone and other items, but not before questioning her about other LULAC members, including others whose homes had been searched. In a news conference outside Paxton’s office Monday, LULAC’s national president accused the attorney general of seeking to “harass and intimidate Latino nonprofit organizations, Latino leaders and LULAC members” with an aim to “suppress the Latino vote.” The Latino vote in Texas has become a major driving force in determining which way the seemingly deep red state swings. Most recently, growing and increasingly diverse populations in Texas’ major cities have cut into the GOP’s dominance in statewide elections, providing narrower margins of victory in those races. At the same time, Texas has underscored that Latinos as a group are nowhere near monolithic. Democrats’ share of Latino voters in South Texas counties near the border has dwindled in recent presidential elections, making their votes more highly sought-after. While that may seem to be contradictory with Trump’s racist policies and statements against immigrants from Central and South America, there’s no denying that his rhetoric about border security has resonated with voters there. That’s also increasingly the case in those same major cities that have been recently been seen as Democratic strongholds. Which leads us to Paxton’s motivations in drawing the ire of LULAC with these raids. The group had never formally backed a political candidate in its 95-year history — until this month, when it endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Paxton hasn’t exactly been a subtle operator in the past. If his office hadn’t blocked mail-in applications ahead of the 2020 election, Paxton claimed on former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s podcast in 2021, “we would’ve been one of those battleground states that they were counting votes in Harris County for three days and Donald Trump would’ve lost the election.” He also most likely feels emboldened to take bigger swings after the state Senate acquitted him of corruption charges in an impeachment trial last year. Paxton also has the comfort of knowing that he’s carrying out the will of the national GOP and its presidential nominee. Trump has instructed the Republican National Committee to devote more resources to election integrity than traditional fieldwork ahead of this election. Just last week, he insisted at a rally in North Carolina that the GOP’s “primary focus is not to get out the vote, it is to make sure [Democrats] don’t cheat.” But for the Republican plans to challenge election results in court to succeed, there needs to be a convincing case that there’s more than partisan politics at work. In targeting such a specific group and its members, Paxton may have undermined those efforts. Already, LULAC is asking the Justice Department to investigate Paxton’s efforts as a potential violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Even with years of conservatives’ narrowing the Voting Rights Act’s scope, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division can flex plenty of muscle if it believes a state has moved to suppress a minority group’s vote. Paxton may have thought that LULAC would be easy pickings or that the searches he authorized would subdue its efforts to get Latinos to the voting booth this fall. But given the response so far, I don’t think this is the fight that Paxton wanted — or one that he has much of a chance of winning."
"Hundreds of former Bush, McCain and Romney staffers back Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"Aug. 27, 2024, 9:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hundreds-former-bush-mccain-romney-staffers-back-harris-rcna168430,"Late last week, the two major-party presidential nominees traded notable endorsements. On the one hand, Donald Trump picked up support from independent conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which didn’t seem to bother Democrats at all. Around the same time, Kamala Harris and her team said they would see the RFK Jr. endorsement and raise Team Trump with a dozen Republican White House lawyers who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, each of whom are now supporting the Democratic nominee. This week, something similar happened. Trump picked up backing from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, at which point members of Team Harris again said they’d see the former congresswoman’s endorsement and raise Trump a whole lot more of bipartisan support. USA Today reported: If this sounds at all familiar, President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign received similar backing from former Bush, McCain, and Romney staffers four years ago. The difference is, the number is even larger now. “We reunite today, joined by new George H.W. Bush alumni, to reinforce our 2020 statements and, for the first time, jointly declare that we’re voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz this November,” the letter reads. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.” These new endorsements, eagerly touted by the Democratic nominee’s campaign, came on the heels of Harris also picking up a variety of other Republican endorsements and Democrats including some GOP speakers at the party’s convention in Chicago. To be sure, there’s room for debate about the electoral impact of announcements like these, but don’t be too quick to overlook the broader context. Trump continues to insist, on a daily basis, that the vice president is a radical communist hellbent on destroying the American way of life. It’s against that backdrop that hundreds of Republicans, who’ve held public office and/or served in GOP administrations, keep coming forward to effectively remind the electorate just how wrong the former president’s attacks are."

Ruben Gallego picked up an endorsement this week from the Arizona Police Association. The same law enforcement association endorsed Donald Trump last week. * At his latest campaign stop in Michigan, Trump claimed Rep. John James secretly won the 2020 U.S. Senate race that James, in reality, actually lost. * Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign is over, Cornel West’s independent presidential campaign is apparently making appeals to anti-vaccine voters. * On a related note, the Trump campaign has confirmed that RFK Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have been added to the Republican’s 2024 transition team. * And in Maryland, the latest AARP poll found Harris trouncing Trump by 32 points, but the same survey found Republican Larry Hogan and Democrat Angela Alsobrooks tied in the state’s U.S. Senate race, 46% to 46%.
