0,Trump again calls for flag-burning punishment: 'We'll make it constitutional',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 08:35:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-first-amendment-supreme-court-rcna168381,"Donald Trump is still calling for a punishment that violates the Constitution: jailing people who burn the American flag. It’s been one of the Republican presidential nominee’s consistent proposals this election cycle. Trump just pushed the idea again Monday while speaking in Detroit to the National Guard Association of the United States. “You burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year,” the former president said, adding: “We gotta do it. ... They say, ‘Sir, that’s unconstitutional.’ We’ll make it constitutional.”  The “they” who said that’s unconstitutional was a Supreme Court majority that included conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That hasn’t stopped Trump from advocating the idea after protests outside the Israeli consulate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week and in Washington, D.C., last month during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address.    As for “mak[ing] it constitutional,” we were reminded last month how hard it is to amend the Constitution when President Joe Biden proposed an amendment in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in Trump v. United States. Of course, as we saw in the immunity case, an easier route to accomplish Republican legal goals is by going through the justices themselves — though there isn’t a flag-burning case before the high court currently presenting that opportunity.

1,Republicans eye 'parallel' probe of Trump assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 08:10:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-eye-parallel-probe-trump-assassination-attempt-rcna168410,"On the surface, Republicans had reason to be pleased by the congressional response to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. In the House, for example, both parties’ leaders quickly came to an agreement to create a bipartisan investigatory task force — featuring seven Republican and six Democratic lawmakers — and it was approved unanimously. What’s more, House Speaker Mike Johnson chose several far-right election deniers and conspiracy theorists to serve on the panel, which has wasted no time getting to work, despite the fact that Congress is on its summer break. Indeed, task force members have already traveled to the scene of the Pennsylvania shooting for a first-hand examination. And yet, some GOP members still aren’t pleased. Politico reported: “So myself and Cory Mills are leading a parallel investigation into what happened on J-13th and the assassination attempt,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said on a podcast last week, referring to the July 13 shooting. “And we’re doing that because, like many of your listeners, we don’t trust the federal government to actually do the job necessary.” Crane, incidentally, recently told a conservative media outlet, in reference to the shooting, “I don’t put it past some of the people in our government, their willingness to do anything to get rid of President Donald Trump.” Just so we’re all clear, the idea that House GOP leaders chose “serious” Republicans to serve on the task force is a difficult idea to take seriously. The speaker tapped Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, for example, and he’s an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee is also on the panel, despite being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and despite the fact that his right-wing background was so controversial in 2017 that the Senate wouldn’t confirm him when Trump nominated him to serve as secretary of the Army. The task force will be chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who, in addition to being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, is also up to his ears in the fake elector scandal; has accused Barack Obama of running a secret “shadow government”; and initially responded to the assassination attempt by describing it without evidence as an “attack from the left.” Perhaps most notable of all is Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana — an election denier who’s also taken a leading role in concocting deeply weird conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, including bizarre allegations related to the FBI and “ghost buses.” As a recent New York Times report summarized, “Even by a conspiracy theorist’s standards, the wild claims made by Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, stand out.” Johnson, eyeing “serious” members, nevertheless tapped Higgins for the congressional investigation. And yet, Crane and Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida have apparently concluded that the task force’s GOP members aren’t quite unhinged enough, necessitating a “parallel” examination. As a result, the public should expect to eventually see two reports: one from a bipartisan task force led by far-right Republicans, and another from a partisan task force led by even-further-to-the-right Republicans. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
2,"Trump calls his former chief of staff a ‘terrible, stupid person’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-calls-former-chief-staff-terrible-stupid-person-rcna168369,"Donald Trump added to his unfortunate record of disparaging military service two weeks ago when the former president said the Presidential Medal of Freedom was “much better” than the Medal of Honor — comments the Veterans of Foreign Wars, among others, described as “asinine.” Former Trump chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, a fierce critic of his former boss, agreed. “The two awards cannot be compared in any way,” he told CNN. “Not even close.” A week later, the GOP presidential nominee returned fire. The New York Times reported: In case it weren’t quite enough that Trump referred to his own former White House chief of staff as “one of the dumbest people” he’s ever met, in the same interview, the Republican called Kelly a “lowlife” and a “terrible, stupid person.” With 10 weeks remaining before Election Day, Trump is directing some of his harshest criticisms at the retired Marine general he tapped to oversee the Department of Homeland Security and his own White House. Indeed, this latest offensive extends one of the strangest ongoing feuds in contemporary American politics. Circling back to our earlier coverage, it was just two months ago when Trump, unprompted, lashed out at Kelly as “dumb” and a “lost soul.” Months earlier, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” There was no great mystery as to the motivation for the offensive. After all, Kelly is the one who confirmed on the record that Trump really did denigrate American servicemembers as “suckers and losers.” “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly told CNN in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. I continue to believe the fact that the Republican nominee is publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign.

3,Michigan sheriff reportedly faces a state investigation over Trump’s campaign event in Howell,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-howell-michigan-sheriff-mike-murphy-investigation-rcna168312,"A Michigan sheriff who hosted Donald Trump last week reportedly is facing an investigation over complaints that the event violated the state’s campaign finance law. Trump’s choice of Howell, Michigan, was controversial in and of itself, given that he was visiting shortly after white supremacists gathered there and celebrated him and Adolf Hitler. But the props at the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office event — including law enforcement officers and sheriff’s vehicles carefully staged in the background — were just as disturbing as the location. And they gave the impression that the sheriff’s office was endorsing the GOP presidential nominee, despite Sheriff Mike Murphy’s insistence beforehand that it would be a news conference and not a political event. On Thursday, the Detroit Metro Times reported that two complaints filed over the event have prompted the state’s Bureau of Elections to investigate whether Murphy violated the Michigan Campaign Finance Act. An attorney told local outlet MLive that the sheriff could potentially skirt legal trouble by allowing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to speak in the same setting. And Murphy — who denied having committed any violation — told the outlet he would “extend her the same courtesy for sure.” Indeed, inviting Harris (no matter her response) may help the sheriff elude legal consequences, but it doesn’t address the ethical — and I’d argue moral — dilemma that his office has created. Nor does it address the legitimacy crisis that Murphy has unleashed. At last week’s event, Murphy’s officers stood behind Trump as he rambled and falsely accused Harris and the Democratic Party of letting crime run rampant, claims that don’t align with reality. So the essence of Trump’s speech wasn’t just a lie — it was a lie told by a criminal in his own right, one who has fomented an insurrection in which police officers were beaten, and who also has backed policing practices — such as stop and frisk — that have been used to prey upon Black and Latino people disproportionately. And yet members of the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office lent Trump their gravitas by literally backing him up as he told this lie. It begs the question: Why should the local residents trust these officers to protect their rights, if the department was so willing to let them be aligned with one of the most notorious lawbreakers in American history? Can a law enforcement officer legitimately claim to uphold the Constitution after appearing alongside a man who has proposed “termination” of some of it? To be sure, these aren’t merely questions for the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office; many other officers across the nation also have posed with Trump since his election loss in 2020. All of them seemingly without a care in the world for the grim message it sends to the residents they encounter daily — that they care about power and control more than law and order."
4,RFK Jr.'s endorsement of Donald Trump confirms what we've suspected all along,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 13:50:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-donald-trump-endorsement-kennedy-conspiracy-rcna168287,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 25 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Shunned by Democrats and estranged from his family, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been desperate for validation. So desperate, in fact, that he has now joined forces with Donald Trump.  Of course, as the most prolific anti-vax conspiracy theorist in the country, Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump was a long time coming. Frankly, the two have a lot in common: Both have enormous egos that cloud their judgment, both rely on misinformation to prey on people’s fears, and both leverage their last name for their own self-interest. But for Kennedy, this endorsement also marks another act of rebellion against his family and the institutions they helped build. Although he shares the same name as his father, he could not be more different.  His dad — the original Robert Kennedy — was driven by a genuine concern for the health and welfare of the American people. He was a champion of the underprivileged and the vulnerable. He appealed to people’s better angels, not their worst instincts.  When it came to modern medicine, he said those with power and influence have a duty to aid the less fortunate. As Kennedy told a group of doctors in Indiana in 1968, “We have to recognize those of us who have the advantages that you have and that I have that we have an obligation of responsibility to those who do not.” In other words, Kennedy believed that it was not enough to merely ""do no harm"" — he felt strongly that people in a position to help others have an obligation to do so.   Needless to say, the apple has fallen pretty far from the tree. Kennedy has not only failed in his “obligation of responsibility,” he’s actually done the opposite. He’s used his privilege and his name to encourage the most vulnerable Americans to turn their backs on modern medicine. He’s used falsehoods to stoke widespread fear of even routine vaccines, including the vaccines that eradicated measles, mumps and polio. If Trump and Kennedy have their way, parents will once again have to worry that their kids could be susceptible to life-threatening diseases at school.   But here’s the thing: Kennedy is not only insulting his father’s legacy, he’s also trying to sabotage the party that his family has shaped and influenced for more than six decades. Remember, his endorsement comes just days after new reporting showed his candidacy was now costing Trump more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris. We also can’t forget that Kennedy’s political ambitions were, in part, financed by one of Trump’s biggest billionaire donors. By endorsing Trump, Kennedy is simply confirming what we suspected all along: that his goal is to be a spoiler for the Democratic ticket. And while we still don’t know what the real impact of this endorsement will be, we do know that the headlines shouldn’t read: “Kennedy endorses Trump.” They should read: “Dangerous conspiracy theorists join forces.”  Join Jen Psaki, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

5,How racism claims play into Trump's Georgia criminal case appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 13:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fani-willis-racism-georgia-election-case-rcna168265,"The issue of race permeates Donald Trump’s Georgia state election interference case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Trump’s latest court filing in a pretrial appeal seeking Willis’ disqualification reminds us that it surfaces in a legal claim, specifically.    At least, the former president — who has harnessed racism for his political ends — wants it to be an issue that kicks Willis off the case or even gets it dismissed.  Recall that, back in March, Judge Scott McAfee declined to force Willis’ removal. The defense had alleged a conflict of interest stemming from her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. McAfee didn’t find an actual conflict but said the appearance of impropriety required Willis or Wade to step down, and the latter did.  Responding to a separate defense claim, relevant to Trump’s new court filing on Monday, McAfee criticized a speech that Willis gave at an Atlanta church whose effect, the judge wrote in his March ruling, “was to cast racial aspersions at an indicted Defendant’s decision to file this pretrial motion.” Yet the trial judge concluded that Willis didn’t cross the line to the point of denying a fair trial or requiring her disqualification. The state criminal case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been on hold pending the appeal, where this issue is the focus of the GOP presidential nominee’s latest filing to Georgia’s state appeals court. “Willis falsely declared that allegations against her stemmed from racism to hide the fact that they were true,” his lawyers wrote of the prosecutor, who is Black. She “obviously intended that every potential Fulton County juror who heard or read Willis’ racist speech should label the defendants as racists,” the lawyers added. While McAfee criticized Willis in his ruling, Trump’s lawyers argued in their appellate filing that “the mere verbal rebuke of Willis by the trial judge was utterly insufficient — it demanded disqualification.” In rejecting the defense claim, McAfee wrote that Georgia law on so-called forensic misconduct is unclear in terms of the relevant standard for determining disqualification. That could make it more of an open question how the courts resolve the appeal, which has been set for oral argument in December. If Willis and her office are disqualified, that would raise questions of when or even whether the case could go forward with a new prosecutor’s office. Defending McAfee’s bottom line in keeping her on the case, Willis’ office wrote earlier this month that the judge didn’t abuse his discretion “in finding that none of the District Attorney’s statements were capable of permanently impairing the fundamental fairness of any future trial and that, as a result, disqualification was not appropriate.” To be sure, this disqualification issue is separate from the underlying substance of the case, in which Trump and others were charged a year ago for their alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election in the state. And there are other issues to resolve before the case can proceed to trial, including the effect of the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling. If Trump is elected in November, more attention may be drawn to his state criminal cases, which presidents don’t have the power to pardon or dismiss, as Trump’s lawyers try to overturn his New York state guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. But whether Trump wins or loses in November, the fate of the Georgia case may not become clear for some time.

6,"Trump howls as Harris, Dems turn him into the 2024 incumbent",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 11:36:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-howls-harris-dems-turn-2024-incumbent-rcna168276,"During the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters didn’t literally describe Donald Trump as an incumbent, but it was a message the party was eager to convey. Over the weekend, the former president added text to the subtext. “Kamala and her ‘handlers’ are trying to make it sound like I am the Incumbent President,” the Republican whined early Saturday at 1:15 a.m. He’s not the only one who’s noticed. TPM’s Josh Marshall summarized: I can appreciate why this is exasperating to the GOP nominee and his supporters. Harris is, after all, the incumbent vice president. She’s also the candidate offering American voters a breath of fresh air and a “new way forward,” as the Democrat put it in her convention speech. To a very real degree, Trump brought this on himself, pretending he won the 2020 race, asking that he be described as “Mr. President,” meeting with foreign officials as a matter of course, banishing the word “former” from his title, etc. But there’s more to it than that. As Off Message’s Brian Beutler noted in his latest column: Quite right. Trump grudgingly exited the White House in January 2021, but in the months and years that followed, he not only retook control of his political party, he also remained a dominant voice in the American discourse, en route to cruising through GOP primaries and caucuses, becoming his party’s presidential nominee for the third consecutive cycle. As a legal and official matter, the Republican has no more authority than you or I. He can’t sign or veto bills. He can’t issue executive orders. He is a private citizen with no powers to speak of. But it’s hardly unreasonable to conclude that we’re mired in the Trump era of American politics. And that, in turn, is precisely why Harris has an advantage as the candidate of change. The message to the electorate couldn’t be more straightforward: 2024 offers a unique opportunity to bring the Trump era to an end and usher in something new."
7,Jack Smith reportedly won’t seek a ‘mini-trial’ in Trump’s Jan. 6 case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 10:49:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-mini-trial-trump-jan-6-election-interference-rcna168195,"Special counsel Jack Smith reportedly isn’t planning on seeking a so-called mini-trial in Donald Trump’s federal election interference case before the November election. I’ll explain what that means and why that isn’t the crucial issue in the broader context of the prosecution and Trump’s criminal cases generally. The context that prompted speculation about such a hearing is the Supreme Court’s July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States, which laid out a vague test for presidential immunity that now falls to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to apply, to see how much of Trump’s indictment survives the high court’s ruling (an issue that may well return to the justices for review of her decision before any trial can happen). The question is how Chutkan will seek to accomplish that complex task: With just written briefs? With briefs followed by an expansive hearing featuring witness testimony? It’s not clear yet. The parties have a joint status report due to Chutkan on Friday about how they want to proceed, after Smith notably requested more time to finalize the government’s position, with Trump’s team unsurprisingly agreeing to the further delay. Ahead of that status report coming due, Bloomberg News reported Friday that Smith “has decided against seeking a major hearing to present evidence in the election-interference case against Donald Trump before voters go to the polls,” and The New York Times similarly reported that federal prosecutors “now appear unlikely to seek a broad public airing of their evidence in a courtroom before Election Day.” The reports, which cited people familiar with the matter, have not been independently confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC. But if true, this news isn’t too surprising. After the immunity ruling, it became even clearer that no Jan. 6 trial was going to happen before the election. As shown most recently by Smith requesting more time to determine his position on how to proceed, the government seems to understand that there’s no use in rushing now. So what’s the public missing out on if there isn’t such a hearing before the election? One answer seems to be that voters could learn even more about Trump’s actions after the 2020 presidential election that led to the indictment. (He has pleaded not guilty.) But Jan. 6 isn’t a whodunit. Whatever happens in this criminal case, Trump’s behavior that day is well documented and has been broadcast for all to understand. A federal court hearing (which wouldn’t be televised, by the way) could add more details, but anyone inclined to pay attention has long had abundant information available to them that should make the matter clear for electoral purposes, one way or the other. Perhaps it would be worse politically for Trump if, in the days leading up to the November election, there were additional daily reports of his antidemocratic behavior on this score. But that political issue isn’t the issue in court. The bigger legal issue is that if Trump wins the election, then his federal cases are as good as gone. (Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the former president’s federal classified documents case, to which Trump has also pleaded not guilty, with Smith’s appellate brief due Tuesday.) Voters are free to consider that electing Trump again would mean that he’d never face federal criminal trials for Jan. 6 or his allegedly unlawful retention of classified documents and obstruction. (With state cases, presidents can’t dismiss them or issue pardons; Trump’s lawyers are arguing that the immunity ruling should cause his New York guilty verdicts to be reversed, while his Georgia state case, in which he has pleaded not guilty, is tied up on a pretrial appeal unrelated to immunity.) And the immunity ruling isn’t the only recent high court decision implicating how Trump’s case in Washington moves forward. Another one that Trump’s lawyers will press is Fischer v. United States, in which the court narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. Two of Trump’s four charges in his Jan. 6 indictment are obstruction-related, so even if the Fischer case doesn’t upend Trump’s prosecution to the extent that the immunity decision has and will, it’s yet another issue potentially complicating the case. Again, the case becomes uncomplicated if Trump wins the election, because he’d then be empowered to get rid of the case. In the meantime, of course, it isn’t fully up to Smith or Trump how the case proceeds. It’s up to the judge. We should learn more about where the case is headed when we see the report on Friday, with a status conference set for next week, on Sept. 5, that could shed more light on what’s next.

8,Shouldn’t Trump release his latest tax returns right about now?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 06:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shouldnt-trump-release-latest-tax-returns-right-now-rcna168192,"Donald Trump’s history of unfortunate money-making schemes took an unsettling turn in March when the former president started peddling the “God Bless the U.S.A. Bible,” offering customers an opportunity to get “the only Bible endorsed by President Trump” for just $59.99. It was a predictably successful venture: The cash-strapped Republican made $300,000 on the branded Bibles. We know this because of a personal financial disclosure form Team Trump released nearly two weeks ago. A CNN report on the documents added: All of which left us with a lingering question that regularly goes unasked: Shouldn’t Trump release his latest tax returns right about now? To be sure, I’m mindful of the larger circumstances. In May 2014 — more than a full decade ago — Trump promised to release his tax returns if he became a candidate. “If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely,” the Republican said the year before his ride down the golden escalator. “And I would love to do that.” In the years that followed, Trump ignored the modern bipartisan tradition, kept his tax returns hidden, broke a variety of promises related to transparency, and fought tooth and nail to keep the information from the public. Eventually, in the wake of leaks and court rulings, Americans learned details that were unflattering to the former president. But now that he’s running yet again, and Trump is the GOP’s nominee for the third consecutive cycle, shouldn’t the question return to the fore? Shouldn’t the Republican candidate at least face some questions about whether he’ll release his tax returns — even if we know the answer will be no? Often, questions we know the answers to go unasked, but that doesn’t mean the questions themselves lack merit. To simply not ask Trump about his recent tax returns — putting him to peddle yet another round of dubious claims about IRS audits that are probably imaginary — is to go easy on a major-party nominee for no reason. Indeed, the partisan asymmetry matters. On July 21, President Joe Biden announced that he would end his re-election campaign, and one week later, Vice President Kamala Harris released her tax returns from the previous 20 years. Trump could approach transparency the same way. On several occasions, he has said he would. So where are the documents? Why would he insist on secrecy for his tax returns from the last few years?"
9,Democrats found a perfect response to Trump's vision of patriotism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-democrats-patriotism-trump-rcna167961,"If you listen to many longtime observers, this year’s Democratic National Convention offered up something different from previous incarnations: an emphasis on striking a patriotic stance. From Vice President Kamala Harris praising “the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American” in her acceptance speech down to the attendees waving little flags in the audience, Democrats put their love of country front and center. But was this that much of a departure from the past? Osita Nwanevu, a contributing editor for The New Republic and columnist with The Guardian, wasn’t so sure Friday. “Which Democratic nominee didn’t ‘embrace patriotism?’” he asked in a now-deleted post on X. “Biden? Obama? Clinton?” Nwanevu is right that there wasn’t a time when Democrats explicitly rejected patriotism. What we saw last week, though, was a shift in tone and rhetoric, as Democrats filled the gap Republicans left wide open to define what “patriotism” means. Rather than mimic the GOP to insist that they are also patriots, for the first time in decades the DNC’s attendees instead declared with their whole chests that theirs is the party of real patriots. For longer than I’ve been alive, Republicans have been more than happy to accuse anyone to the left of former President Ronald Reagan of harboring anti-American sentiments. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, accelerated that trend as, in the aftermath, conservatives called forth a wave of jingoism and xenophobia that they insisted was the only way to love America. The PATRIOT Act authorized vast powers for the federal government to curtail Americans’ privacy and freedom of speech. President George W. Bush’s warning to other nations — “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists” — was turned inward toward any liberals who might speak out against invading Iraq. Many Democrats, terrified of accusations of not respecting the troops or being soft on terror, embarrassed themselves in their attempts to prove their own love of country. It’s impossible to defend how then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., began his acceptance speech at the 2004 DNC without cringing. (“John Kerry, reporting for duty,” he said with a crisp salute, despite having left the military more than 30 years earlier.) In the Obama era, the tea party movement’s thinly veiled racism was initially framed as a rejection of tyranny, drawing on symbols from the American Revolution, and “patriots” became a word associated with a certain brand of conservative. Ever focused on branding, former President Donald Trump claimed that visual vocabulary for his own, entwining his MAGA movement with the trappings of the banal, surface-level patriotism that Republicans had already embraced. But while he has embraced the American flag, sometimes literally, he has denigrated the highest ideals that that flag represents. Instead, Trump has called for the “termination” of the Constitution, and he has already attempted to overturning one presidential election. Trump has called the rioters who attempted to prevent his loss from becoming official on Jan. 6, 2021, “patriots” and just announced a fundraiser in their honor next month. Republicans, with very few exceptions, have backed his dystopian desire to substitute himself in place of devotion to the national interest. Despite that, as The Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted, voters are still more likely to view the GOP as the more patriotic party. Polling has somewhat borne that out in the past. A YouGov poll in 2018 found that Democrats were much less likely to call themselves “very” or even “somewhat” patriotic than their Republican counterparts. It’s worth noting that this was during the height of the Trump years, a time when Democrats had their faith in America deeply shaken. It’s a faith that has yet to recover, though, according to a survey Gallup conducted in June, which found only 34% of Democrats describe themselves as “extremely proud” to be an American. And yet the flag-waving and chants of “U-S-A” last week in Chicago would suggest otherwise. It instead speaks to an effort at redefining what love of country means along with reclaiming the concept of “freedom.” Democrats are celebrating the country’s diversity as a sign of national greatness — as opposed to the GOP’s picture of a nation of homogeneous, unwavering loyalty. This vision expands on President Joe Biden’s framing of the threat to democracy, broadening from a single man to the GOP’s fetish for that man. In setting out this new vision of patriotism, Democrats should remember that there must be room for loving criticism. In her opening essay for “The 1619 Project,” The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote about how Black Americans have always been among the most patriotic citizens. This is because despite the indignities we have suffered, we’ve been the ones most committed to seeing America embrace the better angels of its nature. The same can be said of the protesters gathered outside the arena each day and night to urge the Biden administration to halt the sale of arms to Israel as it continues its war in Gaza. The progressivism Democrats displayed last week can make an awkward fit with the conservative-coded aspects of patriotism, as The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Will Bunch rightly noted. But I would still argue that the two are more in sync than it would first appear. After all, it is an act of love of country to ask it to live up to its own ideals, to believe that it can still change for the better. The wish to see your home hold itself to the morals that it claims to represent is more patriotic than the desire to see one man ensconced as monarch in the White House."
10,"Democrats, stop calling the Harris-Trump race ‘the prosecutor’ vs. ‘the felon’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-26 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-prosecutor-felon-democrats-rcna167349,"Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, some Democrats have summarized her matchup against former President Donald Trump as “the prosecutor” versus “the felon.” On the day that President Joe Biden passed the baton to Harris, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said of her, “She is a prosecutor running against a felon.” At last week’s Democratic convention, speakers including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Biden embraced that framing. In defending his record on public safety, Biden said Monday, “And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.” The prosecutor versus the felon is the kind of glib expression that’s perfect for an election-year bumper sticker. However, the suggestion that a “felon” is inherently and permanently untrustworthy makes for a heaping helping of hypocrisy from a party that has rightly identified overcriminalization, mass incarceration and voter suppression as systemic problems. Yes, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts in May. Were it not for a Georgia prosecutor’s affair with a lawyer she hired, a Trump appointee in Florida entertaining his ridiculous motions and a Supreme Court that seems bent on rejecting the whole theory of America, he may have been convicted of up to 54 more. That said, Trump showed his manifest unfitness for office long before any of those indictments. He exhibited it during his first campaign, during his term in office, while campaigning as an incumbent and no more so than by rejecting his status as a lame duck. And he is further demonstrating that unfitness during this, his third campaign for president. But to label him a felon and use it to mean unfitness is to suggest that all “felons,” by their very nature, are bad and irredeemable. A political slogan can’t communicate every nuance. But at a minimum, it shouldn’t send a message inconsistent with the party’s stated values. There has been a conscious effort in recent years — no doubt derided by detractors as “woke” — to refrain from using language that dehumanizes people and reduces them to their status or their circumstances. Say “enslaved people,” not “slaves.” Say “incarcerated people,” not “prisoners” or “inmates.” Again, there are critics of such constructions, and, without a doubt, those constructions make for clunkier sentences. But the point remains that people who have experienced a thing are far more than the thing they’ve experienced. Consider the lawyer, poet and writer Reginald Dwayne Betts, as brilliant a person as you’ll find in this country. Before he wrote three acclaimed books of poetry and a memoir, and before his genius was recognized by the MacArthur Foundation, he spent years in prison for a violent carjacking he committed when he was 16. When discussing the title of his 2019 volume of poetry, Betts told NPR, “It’s called ‘Felon.’ But the thing is, ‘felon’ is just such an inadequate description of anybody.” Those using the “prosecutor vs. felon” dichotomy appear unaware of the inadequacy of that framing. They may believe themselves to be making a commentary only about Trump. But they are betraying a belief that the word “felon” tells you everything you’ll ever need to know about a person. And, to repeat, they’re undercutting their arguments against less punitive sentences and their arguments against letting people who’ve served their time vote again. If all felons are bad, then why should we fight for their right to participate in elections? Let’s set aside the fact that some people convicted of felonies aren’t guilty and, for argument’s sake, assume that everyone so labeled committed a significant crime. Even then, the list of felons would include good people who did uncharacteristically awful things, sometimes accidental things. That list would also include people who were horrible human beings and turned their lives around. And, yes, it would include people like Trump, that is, people we know would commit the same crimes again if given the chance. The argument against Trump, therefore, isn’t that he has a record. It’s that he’s unrepentant: a mendacious, self-seeking narcissist who has never evinced a shred of self-reflection or regret. It’s that he never has been, and likely never will be, deserving of anybody’s trust, let alone the country’s trust. As a veteran journalist, I have known a significant number of elected officials who have gone to prison. Not only that, but I’ve watched a few of them re-emerge, return to the game of politics and even run for office again. One of them once requested a meeting with me where he asked how I squared my belief in second chances with my opposition to his candidacy. Easily. My belief that people shouldn’t be forever punished doesn’t mean I think people who have been criminally punished and then run for office are automatically due political support. It doesn’t mean I think they’re good people. There are people I’d consider voting for even if they have gone to prison, and others I’d never consider even if they haven’t. Under no circumstances would the Democrats throwing around the word “felon” have considered voting for him even if a jury hadn’t found him guilty. That’s because they’re not opposed to Trump because he’s a “felon.” They’re opposed to Trump because he’s Trump."
11,Trump judge greenlights machine guns under Second Amendment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-25 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/machine-guns-second-amendment-bruen-rcna168012,"A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump dismissed criminal charges for machine gun possession this week, citing the Second Amendment and Supreme Court precedent. The ruling highlights how the high court has expanded gun rights, as well as the broader impact Trump has had on the judiciary beyond the Supreme Court. U.S. District Judge John Broomes’ ruling on Wednesday stemmed from the prosecution of Tamori Morgan, who was charged with two counts of possessing a machine gun under federal law. Morgan cited the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in Bruen to argue that the case should be dismissed on Second Amendment grounds. Justice Clarence Thomas’ opinion for the Republican-appointed majority in Bruen said that gun regulations can’t stand unless they’re “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” The Kansas federal judge wrote that in Morgan’s case, the government failed to meet its burden “to demonstrate through historical analogs that regulation of the weapons at issue in this case are consistent with the nation’s history of firearms regulation.” The vast implications of Broomes’ ruling might not be fully realized if the government gets it reversed on appeal. The judge noted that the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Kansas and neighboring states, had yet to apply Bruen to the law at issue in Morgan’s case. There’s reason to think that even this Supreme Court could side with the government if the issue reaches the justices. Just this past term, in United States v. Rahimi, the court ruled 8-1 (over Thomas’ dissent) to uphold gun restrictions on people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence. The Rahimi case suggests that the court isn’t prepared to take the Bruen precedent as far as it could go. But in the meantime, chaos looms for gun laws and public safety — whether it’s due to the Supreme Court’s expansive gun jurisprudence, the misinterpretation of that jurisprudence by lower court judges, or both.

12,The DNC outperformed the RNC in a category that will probably vex Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-24 13:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/dnc-ratings-rnc-trump-tv-crowds-rcna168089,"As Democrats made the case for their presidential nominee this week, an average of 21.8 million viewers tuned in over four days to watch the events in Chicago, according to Nielsen data. Viewership numbers for the Democratic National Convention eclipsed the Republican National Convention’s 19.1 million average viewers in July. And, per Nielsen, the final night of the DNC, which featured Harris’ acceptance speech, drew 26.2 million viewers, slightly higher than the 25.3 million people who watched the last night of the Republican convention. Part of that may be due to the length of the nominees’ speeches: Harris’ clocked in at a relatively brief 38 minutes, while Trump’s went on for 92 minutes — the longest nomination acceptance speech on record. Curiosity and anticipation for Harris, whose candidacy has garnered a ton of enthusiasm among Democrats, may also explain the interest in the DNC. But other factors might have boosted viewership: The party rolled out A-list celebrity speakers like Oprah Winfrey and musical acts like Lil Jon and Pink, and there was intense speculation (that eventually proved unfounded) that Beyoncé would make an appearance on the final night of the convention to endorse Harris. Convention ratings are far from an accurate indicator of who will win an election. But those data points might vex the GOP nominee, who has long taken pride in his ability to draw a crowd. Trump’s fixation on TV ratings and crowd size are well documented, and his frustration with the large audiences that Harris has drawn at her campaign events in recent weeks has been obvious. He has falsely claimed that Harris used artificial intelligence to change a photo to inflate the number of attendees at her rally in Detroit — a claim he appeared to walk back days later. When asked how concerned he was about the audience at Harris’ rallies, Trump accused the media of being “dishonest” about his crowd sizes. He also suggested that more people turned out for his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 — which preceded the Capitol riots — than for Martin Luther King Jr.’s address during the March on Washington in 1963."
13,'A betrayal': RFK Jr.'s family members decry his endorsement of Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-24 08:34:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-endorsement-family-rcna168068,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s family members have denounced his decision to endorse Donald Trump after he dropped out of the presidential race, calling it a “betrayal” of their family’s values. In a statement released shortly after Kennedy announced Friday that he is suspending his independent bid for president and backing the Republican nominee, five of his siblings reiterated their support for the Democratic ticket and criticized their brother. “Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,” they wrote. “It is a sad ending to a sad story.” The statement was signed by five of his eight surviving siblings: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Chris Kennedy and Rory Kennedy. Kennedy’s family members have been open about their disdain for his long-shot presidential bid. Several of them publicly backed President Joe Biden in April, and they have continued to support the Harris-Walz ticket since Biden stepped aside. A member of the famed Democratic political dynasty endorsing Trump would have been unthinkable even 18 months ago. But the 70-year-old anti-vaccine activist’s distrust in government has appeal on the right, and his penchant for conspiracy theories aligns with Trump’s own leanings. In his speech in Arizona on Friday, Kennedy railed against what he called Democrats’ “continual legal warfare” against him and Trump, and he accused the media of engaging in a conspiracy with Democrats to hinder his campaign. Kennedy also acknowledged that his involvement with Trump’s campaign “will be a difficult sacrifice for my wife and children” but is “worthwhile” to save children from processed foods and obesity. At a campaign rally later on Friday, Trump praised Kennedy — an opponent he once called “the most radical left candidate in the race” — as a “great person.” Kennedy’s endorsement may ultimately carry little weight, however. He had been performing poorly in polls and his campaign’s fundraising had been in dire straits in recent months. But the Trump campaign may be banking on Kennedy bringing enough supporters to tip the scales in what is set to be a tight election, especially in critical swing states."
14,These fact-checks about Trump are accurate — but they completely miss the point,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-24 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-fact-check-dnc-video-rcna167571,"It’s been a rough week for fact-checkers, as many of their most loyal readers lost patience with their approach to the job. The low point came Monday. A video at the Democratic National Convention showed a clip of Donald Trump saying in 2016 that “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions. Someone at PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit, then posted on X a link to an old fact check on the issue rating criticism of this quote “mostly false.” “He walked back the comment the same day,” the post noted. “We found no evidence that he currently supports legal penalties for women who have abortions.” A community note soon appeared beneath the post. “It is incorrect to say that showing an unedited video of Trump’s own words is ‘false,’” it said. “Reporting from 2016 confirms that this is something Trump said. Even if he walked it back following criticism, it is not false to accurately quote something Trump said.” Take it from me, a former fact-checker: There is nothing lower than this. Having your own facts checked by users of X — not Twitter, but Elon Musk’s vastly degraded version of it — is like watching an NBA player get dunked on by a 14-year-old kid. A reporter for The Washington Post also took heat for a quick fact check of President Joe Biden’s convention speech, in which Biden said that Trump would refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. “But that’s not true,” the reporter wrote. “Trump just hasn’t said that he would accept. And he has previously said the only way he loses is if the Democrats cheat.” This is looking-glass logic. Trump is literally refusing to accept a loss already when he says he can’t lose. These weren’t isolated incidents either. Fact-checkers have also raised hackles recently when they said: These fact checks were all very thoroughly reported, with relevant details and useful context. But they all faced the same problem: They completely missed the point. Some of this is due to a basic courtesy that fact-checkers pretty much have to extend to people running for office. If a candidate promises to do something — or not do something — fact-checkers take them at their word. PolitiFact even maintains a “Promise Tracker” to check whether each presidential campaign pledge is kept or broken. There’s good reason for that. Research has shown that candidates try to keep their promises, contrary to what the cynics think. And to be fair, in most cases there’s no real way to fact-check what may happen in the future other than what a campaign says. But Trump is not like other politicians. PolitiFact’s own Promise Tracker found that he broke 53% of his promises in his term, compared to 23% for Barack Obama and just 3% for Biden. When a fact-checker smacks down a Democrat by noting that Trump has promised not to do something, it ignores that Trump has more often than not broken his promises. Normal candidates also try not to lie. Again, I know that’s not what cynics believe, but politicians who get fact-checked on a certain line will typically drop it or revise it to be more accurate in response. (I once had a rather tense lunch with a campaign staffer who wanted me to retract a fact-check so they could keep using the line.) But Trump’s own former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said at the Democratic convention that he has “no fidelity to the truth” and told her to simply repeat things until people believed them. There’s no simple solution here. Some of these pieces would have been just fine if they weren’t billed as “fact checks.” My advice would be to go ahead and share the context of what Trump said about injecting bleach, but don’t split hairs over what he meant with his bizarre ramblings. And if fact-checkers do have to make a judgment call, I’d advise that they not get tangled up in semantic games and focus on the big picture. If there’s any consolation for the fact-checkers from this last week, it’s that people are upset. That’s a sign that voters still care about the facts — even when politicians don’t."
15,Trump professes his love for dubious stop-and-frisk policing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 14:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-stop-frisk-new-york-police-fox-news-interview-rcna168003,"In a Fox News interview Thursday, Donald Trump all but guaranteed that a victory for him in November would lead to increased use of stop and frisk, the police practice known to facilitate racial profiling. The former president, who of course has been convicted of felonies himself, has endorsed the tactic in the past. He voiced support again Thursday while also endorsing the confiscation of guns, which certainly undercuts the GOP’s Second Amendment absolutism. During his meandering “Fox and Friends” interview, Trump said: Just like officials who have relied on stop-and-frisk policies over the years, Trump spoke in generalities to justify his approach. Police do not know everything about everyone walking down the street, and, in fact, there’s ample evidence that such stops are rather fruitless endeavors that do little to stem crime and often subject racial and ethnic minorities to bias and violations of their civil rights. The New York state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, for example, compiled data from the New York Police Department — which saw a federal judge find its stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional in 2013 — showing that the majority of the people stopped over the past two decades have been people of color and a “vastly disproportionate” number were Black. In addition, the ACLU found that the “overwhelming majority of people stopped by the NYPD have been innocent, meaning the NYPD found no evidence of wrongdoing and the civilian was not given a summons or arrested.” So why is Trump backing it? I suspect there are two reasons. First, Trump has been known to promote false and outright racist allegations about Black and Latino people on his own, so it follows that he would endorse a policy that allows police to do the same. And secondly, his claims about wanting police to be unencumbered helps distract some people from something we already know after his guilty verdicts and massive civil penalties: He doesn’t have any regard for the law."
16,"Trump's 'dog' insults come back to bite him as he courts Kennedy, Kemp support",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 14:06:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-kemp-kennedy-like-a-dog-rcna168016,"Donald Trump has a phrase he likes to use to describe people he believes are in weak, pitiful or even servile positions: “Like a dog.”  As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out in 2020, Trump has used the phrase to attack a host of people, from retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal (who was “fired like a dog”) to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who was “dumped like a dog”) and conservative activist Brent Bozell (who was once “begging for money like a dog”).  It seems fitting to revive the phrase now that the tables have turned on Trump, who’s exhibited some canine qualities of his own recently by nuzzling up to some of the men he’s barked at in the past. With Kamala Harris atop the Democratic ticket, and an election victory more in doubt, Trump now appears more willing to roll over for people who previously drew his ire.  Take Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, for example. For years now, Trump has publicly attacked Kemp for refusing to help overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory in Georgia, and he publicly bashed the governor and his wife earlier this month, prompting Kemp to tell Trump to “leave my family out of it.” Many Republicans said Trump’s outburst might hurt his election chances in Georgia. And whether it was that, the palpable energy of Georgia’s Democratic National Convention delegation, or recent polling data forecasting a close race in Georgia, Trump's tweet touting Kemp suggests he’s feeling the heat. He said: That’s a good boy who's learned to muzzle himself ... for now. Perhaps some belly scratches are on the way. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, spoke with Kemp the night before Trump praised him, CNN reported. (Neither NBC News nor MSNBC has independently confirmed that report.) Perhaps Vance's reported visit was meant to smooth things over? Either way, we’ve seen a similar about-face from Trump when it comes to Trump’s stance on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Earlier this year, Trump’s strategy for combating Kennedy’s independent presidential bid, and its appeal to some Trump voters, involved lobbing personal attacks at Kennedy and his family. But since entering the race, polling suggests Harris is winning over some independent voters, making Kennedy’s candidacy all the more perilous for Trump’s campaign. That likely explains why Trump reportedly spoke with Kennedy recently to discuss a potential Cabinet position should Kennedy drop out of the race. On Friday, Kennedy withdrew from the race, stating in a speech that Trump had asked to ""enlist me in his administration."" He went on endorse Trump in his speech. A day earlier, Trump called into Fox News and heaped praise on Kennedy: These are the kinds of fawning statements one might expect from a candidate who — much like the “dogs” he despises — has been brought to heel."
17,Former Trump spokesperson shares insight into how and why he lies,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 08:27:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-trump-spokesperson-shares-insight-lies-rcna167953,"In April 2020, Stephanie Grisham stepped down as Donald Trump’s White House press secretary. In August 2024, Grisham not only disavowed her former boss, she also spoke at the Democratic National Convention, telling attendees that the Republican nominee has “no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth.” But there was another part of her remarks that stood out for me. “[Trump] used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’ But it does matter — what you say matters, and what you don’t say matters.” At face value, the fact that Grisham was on the stage at all was extraordinary. Not only is Trump’s former vice president withholding his support for the Republican’s 2024 candidacy, and not only is Trump’s former White House chief of staff condemning his former boss, but Trump’s former White House press secretary and communications director appeared at the Democratic convention and explained how and why the Republican lies. But there was something familiar about what Grisham said during her remarks. As I noted in my new book, as Trump’s first year in the White House neared an end, Billy Bush wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times. Bush was not an especially notable public figure at the time, but in the infamous “Access Hollywood” record, he was the one Trump bragged to about assaulting women. (“When you’re a star, they let you do it,” the future president told Bush. “You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the p---y.”) In his 2017 op-ed, Bush reflected on what he’d learned about the then-president and shared an anecdote about a conversation he’d had with Trump about inflating the ratings of his reality-television program. Bush wrote that Trump had told him privately, “People will just believe you. You just tell them, and they believe you.” Seven years later, Grisham said something eerily similar: “[Trump] used to tell me, ‘It doesn’t matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.’” In other words, what Trump privately told Billy Bush about his willingness to lie is effectively identical to what Trump privately told his former White House press secretary about his willingness to lie. It’s a philosophy, for lack of a better word, rooted in the idea that fiction can simply overpower fact through relentless and shameless repetition. Why does the former president repeat transparent nonsense, over and over again? People close to him have already told us the answer."
18,Trump-owned club to host fundraiser for Jan. 6 rioters (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 07:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-owned-club-host-fundraiser-jan-6-rioters-rcna167937,"Discussion of the Jan. 6 attack did not dominate the Democratic National Convention this week, but the party certainly made an effort to remind the public about the assault on the U.S. Capitol and Donald Trump’s responsibility for the insurrectionist violence. In fact, on the third night of the DNC, attendees and viewers saw a four-minute video devoted specifically to Jan. 6. A day later, as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination, she declared, “[C]onsider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the U.S. Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite — he fanned the flames.” It was against this backdrop that The New York Times reported that a group supporting Jan. 6 criminals and defendants will soon hold a fundraising event for rioters at Trump’s golf club in New Jersey. I’m reasonably certain this news was first reported by the MeidasTouch Network. To be sure, the former president is listed on the announcement for the event as an “invited guest speaker,” though the Times’ report added that the GOP nominee does not plan to attend. The article nevertheless added, “Regardless of whether Mr. Trump will be present, it is an unusual — and potentially risky — move to permit a soiree supporting those who stormed the Capitol to be held at one of his most recognizable properties just as his presidential campaign goes full speed for its final few months.” That’s true, though it’s also worth emphasizing the familiarity of the circumstances. NBC News reported in June 2023, for example, that Trump spoke at a fundraiser on behalf of Jan. 6 criminals and defendants, held at his private golf club in Bedminster. “I’m going to make a contribution,” the former president said at the time. Two months later, NBC News ran a separate report, noting that Trump participated in a different fundraiser for Jan. 6 defendants, which was also held at his Bedminster golf club. These latest developments, in other words, are part of a pattern. The news also comes roughly three weeks after the Republican reiterated his intentions to issue pardons to convicted Jan. 6 felons — including those who assaulted police officers during the assault on the Capitol. The Associated Press reported in March that the former president has positioned “the violent siege and its failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House.” This coincided with a related Semafor report on the degree to which the Republican has put Jan. 6 rioters “at the heart of his campaign.” That was true then, and it appears to still be true now."

The more the Republican’s attention could be diverted from television screens, the less likely he’d be to throw tantrums. But if that was the plan, it didn’t work. Before the final night of the DNC got underway, the former president announced that he’d offer online rebuttals to the convention by way of his social media platform. He certainly tried to do that, starting with a weird “WHERE’S HUNTER?” missive, as if Trump had briefly forgotten that there’s no longer any point in going after President Joe Biden’s son. As a New York Times report noted, the online tirades — totaling roughly 50 items — ultimately proved insufficient, prompting the GOP candidate to make a phone call. I can appreciate why the network worked quickly to get the Republican candidate on the air, albeit by telephone. Trump is, after all, the GOP nominee, and it stood to reason that he’d have something notable to say in response to his Democratic rival’s remarks.What Fox might not have realized, however, is that Harris’ convention speech had apparently caused a meltdown. Trump appeared on the air for about 10 minutes, during which time he not only raged incoherently, he also accidentally pushed random buttons on his phone. The interview — I’m using the word loosely — might’ve gone on longer, but Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum effectively cut off the former president mid-rant so that the network could move on to other programming. And while it was certainly amusing to see Fox effectively tell Trump they no longer wanted to hear him whine uncontrollably, it was even funnier when the Republican hung up with one conservative media network, only to call another.In fact, almost immediately after Trump ranted on Fox, he called Newsmax to keep the meltdown going a while longer. In a normal political party, such a meltdown would probably be seen as disqualifying. In the contemporary Republican Party, it was a tragically routine Thursday night."
20,"In convention speech, Kamala Harris succeeded where Trump failed",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-23 05:55:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/convention-speech-kamala-harris-succeeded-trump-failed-rcna167918,"On July 18, Donald Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention, where the former president was expected to deliver one of the most important speeches of his political career. He failed spectacularly: The GOP candidate spoke for more than an hour and a half, reminding voters of all the things they don’t like about him and failing to take advantage of a unique opportunity. Trump meandered aimlessly. He ad-libbed unnecessarily. He lied excessively. He was in equal measures divisive, bitter, juvenile, conspiratorial and alienating. The Republican nominee effectively presented a case study in how not to deliver an acceptance speech at a major party convention. Exactly six weeks later, Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Her remarks were not just a triumph on their own terms, they also succeeded where her Republican rival failed. NBC News reported: Why did her convention speech work? Harris presented herself as the change candidate: That’s not an easy thing for an incumbent vice president to pull off, but the Democrat’s “new way forward” rhetoric resonated in part because she’s running against a failed GOP candidate who’s led his party’s ticket in every election since 2016. Worse, Trump is explicitly running on a platform of taking the nation backwards, while Harris repeatedly used the word ""forward"" in her remarks. Harris reached out to a broad electorate: Six weeks after Trump’s needlessly divisive remarks, the Democratic nominee declared, “I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self.” In the same remarks, she added, “Our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past — a chance to chart a new way forward — not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” Harris was optimistic and patriotic: “[O]ur opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is,” the vice president said. “Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: Freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities. We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world.” Harris sounded like a normal human being: While Trump raged on his social media platform, the Democratic nominee assured voters, “I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense.” Harris was disciplined — and didn’t go on and on: Trump’s 90-minute rant in Milwaukee sent some of his loyalists heading for the exits before it was over. The vice president’s remarks, in contrast, were half as long. The former abandoned his script to share strange thoughts that popped into his mind; the latter recognized the importance of being a disciplined candidate for the nation’s highest office. I won’t pretend to know what’s going to happen on Election Day 2024, but as the dust settles in Chicago, Harris has reason to feel good about her chances."
21,"Falling behind, Trump eyes personal attacks as a life-preserver",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 10:31:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-personal-attacks-election-2024-rcna167805,"It’s not exactly a secret that Republican officials are practically begging Donald Trump to steer clear of personal attacks and focus on substantive issues. It’s also plainly true that the former president doesn’t care for the advice. The results have been predictable: The GOP candidate has gone after Vice President Kamala Harris’ intellect, gender, laugh, family, appearance and race and ethnicity, among other things. At a long and meandering press conference last week, Trump went so far as to say he felt “entitled“ to go after his Democratic rival in personal ways. There’s little evidence to suggest these attacks are working. The former president has even complained publicly that he hasn’t quite figured out how to apply a nickname to Harris that’s stuck. But as a New York Times report noted, Republicans waiting for Trump to abandon the personal attacks and run as a serious candidate should probably give up. In remarks that were ostensibly about national security, the former president went after President Joe Biden, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama and Harris in personal ways. In fact, Trump used the opportunity to tell his followers that he believes the Democratic nominee is both “stupid” and a “Marxist or a communist.” Apparently trying to rationalize his strategy, the Republican acknowledged the behind-the-scenes advice he’s received. “They always say, ‘Sir, please stick to policy. Don’t get personal,’” Trump said. “And yet they’re getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?” On cue, the crowd responded, “No.” At the same event, the candidate polled his audience, which agreed with their applause that Trump should “get personal” against his opponents. It was at that point when he joked, “My advisers are fired.” The point, of course, isn’t that Trump is going to fire his campaign team. Rather, the point is that his rhetoric was a big hint about what’s to come. In fact, given the larger context, it’s likely that the former president doesn’t just want to engage in personal attacks — this is, after all, his comfort zone — he also thinks he has to engage in personal attacks. Polling suggests he’s falling behind Harris; the Democratic convention has gone quite well for the party thus far; and the GOP nominee is increasingly looking for an electoral life-preserver. As The New Republic’s Greg Sargent summarized, Trump genuinely seems to think that Harris’ surge in the polls “is somehow the result of him being constrained from going full gutter MAGA on her.” All of which suggests the American electorate should expect to see the Republican take the presidential race in an even uglier direction over the next 10 or so weeks."
22,I worked for Kamala Harris. Here’s the biggest difference between her and Trump.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 08:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-california-attorney-general-katie-porter-rcna167229,"What kind of president would Kamala Harris be? That’s a question many Americans are rightly asking themselves since the vice president became our presumptive Democratic nominee. As the only member of Congress who’s worked for Kamala Harris, I can provide some insight. We’ve already seen Donald Trump’s record as president. He let the ultrawealthy off the hook for paying their fair share in taxes. He weakened our international alliances. He proposed cuts to Social Security. In a second Trump term, he would do all this again. The Biden-Harris administration has cracked down on tax cheats, restored our global standing and protected Social Security. Vice President Harris would continue this work, while bringing her own leadership style. We can look to her record of public service — a record I have observed up close — to see how she works for the people. Kamala Harris took office as California’s attorney general in 2011, during the long, painful aftermath of the Great Recession. At the time, attorneys general from 49 states were negotiating with the nation’s largest banks, demanding that these institutions take responsibility for their role in the foreclosure crisis. Kamala spent months pushing for a better deal, channeling the pain she’d heard from families on the campaign trail. When the banks refused to do enough, she pulled out of the talks, which threatened to derail the compromise because of California’s size. This angered the bankers. It annoyed other attorneys general, some of whom had been in office for decades. But it was the right thing for her constituents — and it worked. She got the banks to promise more than quadruple what they initially offered to help Californians. That’s someone who can’t be bought or bullied. Now, think about Kamala bringing this tenacity to a high-level international meeting like the G7. She won’t go along to get along; she’ll do what’s right for Americans and for a safer, more peaceful world. Kamala knows that respect is not something one can petulantly demand, as Trump does. Respect comes from the moral authority of doing what’s right and speaking truth to power. Kamala was savvy to press the big banks to do more, but her most remarkable insight guided her next move. She understood that the settlement depended on the banks’ promises to change their unlawful practices — and that given their illegal conduct, it wasn’t enough just to hope that they shaped up. For Kamala, the victory wasn’t the words on the pages of the National Mortgage Settlement or the press conference announcing the deal. Families were counting on government to deliver actual help that improved their lives. Over objections from the big banks, Kamala appointed me as an independent watchdog for the settlement. She empowered me to hold the banks’ feet to the fire and to get results for Californians. I had no formal legal authority, but I had Kamala’s force of will behind me. With her backing, we halted hundreds of foreclosures and forced the banks to consider families for loan modifications. We were able to get one family a six-figure compensation check from one major bank for its flawed processes. We caught another major bank forcing consumers to sign away their right to sue for legal violations —breaking a promise it had made in the settlement — and we forced it to send out hundreds of thousands of correction letters. We successfully pressed the banks to work more to reach the hardest-hit communities, and we held workshops for service members and seniors. We changed lives on the ground. That’s how Kamala is: She sees things through, not stopping until people get help, because she cares about our families. When she called me to offer me the job as California monitor, I had a 2-month-old. Like many working moms, I had to bring my infant to work because she had nowhere else to go. I remember being embarrassed on the call, worrying if Betsy would cry or fuss while I was talking to the attorney general. I nervously confessed that I had my baby with me. Kamala didn’t hesitate. She asked how my baby and I were doing and how her siblings were adjusting. She wasn’t making small talk; she genuinely wanted to know. And then she continued to tell me about how important it was that Californians have a watchdog and a place to report any continued bank misconduct. I had a newborn, two other kids and a full-time job as a college professor. Kamala did not even blink; she expressed confidence in me to do the job and emphasized the importance of the work. This is how I know, very personally, that Americans can count on Kamala to fill her administration with the best, most qualified leaders from all walks of life to advocate for everyday Americans. There couldn’t be a clearer contrast with Donald Trump. As I exposed in congressional hearings, his appointees included a housing secretary who didn’t know basic real estate terms and a postmaster general who didn’t know how much it costs to mail a postcard. I can assure Americans from personal experience: Kamala Harris’ vision for moving America forward will not just be words on a convention stage or at a press conference. Nor will it be the empty promises and lip service that we hear from too many politicians who pose as leaders. Kamala will do what’s right and go to the mat to get it done."
23,Trump pushes unconstitutional punishment for flag-burning at DNC protests,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 08:23:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-punishment-dnc-protests-rcna167749,"While Democrats seek to reclaim the mantle of “freedom” from Republicans this election season, the GOP’s presidential nominee pushed for an unconstitutional punishment for those who exercise their freedom in a way he dislikes — that is, by burning the American flag.  Citing such behavior by protesters outside the Israeli consulate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, Donald Trump called for Congress to pass a law mandating a year in jail for anyone who protests in that manner.  The legal problem with that proposal is that it violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court addressed the issue in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson, when conservative icon Antonin Scalia joined the high court majority in deciding that a conviction for burning the flag was unconstitutional. This isn’t the first time that the former president has advocated for such an unconstitutional punishment. Just last month, Trump did so after people burned flags while protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Washington, D.C., congressional address. And in 2016, as president-elect, he suggested that flag-burners be stripped of their citizenship. It’s unsurprising that the man who flouted his constitutional oath the first time around should lack the understanding, appreciation or both of the law and the freedoms it secures.

24,Trump targets Shapiro as a ‘highly overrated Jewish Governor’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 08:14:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-targets-shapiro-highly-overrated-jewish-governor-rcna167780,"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention were very well received, though Donald Trump was apparently unimpressed. The Wall Street Journal reported: Even for Trump, who peddles antisemitic tropes as a matter of course, this was bizarre. In a middle-of-the-night tirade, the GOP candidate began by arguing, “The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech.” Whether Trump understands this or not, the fact that he emphasized the governor’s faith was itself emblematic of his prejudice: When the former president lashes out at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he doesn’t call him a “highly overrated Lutheran governor.” When Trump whines about House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, he doesn’t call her a “highly overrated Catholic congresswoman.” But when targeting Shapiro, the Republican apparently finds it necessary to call out the governor’s religion — which says quite a bit about Trump, and none of it’s good. In the same online missive, Trump added, “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close.” In other words, as far as the GOP candidate is concerned, in the history of Israel, no other human being — in the United States or abroad — has ever done more for the country than him, which is unintentionally hilarious. In case that weren’t quite enough, the former president went on to say that Vice President Kamala Harris “hates Israel and will do nothing but make its journey through the complexities of survival as difficult as possible, hoping in the end that it will fail.” To the extent that reality still has any meaning, there’s literally no evidence of the Democratic presidential hopeful “hating” Israel, but this sentence stood out for me for an entirely different reason: While Trump habitually publishes angry screeds to his social media platform in the middle of the night, it’s difficult to believe that it was his hands that wrote that Israel is making “its journey through the complexities of survival.” In other words, Trump didn’t just peddle offensive nonsense, he also might’ve had some help putting this one together. For a politician who’s a little too eager to falsely accuse his opponents of antisemitism, this was ridiculous. Indeed, Trump's rhetoric was so ugly that a White House spokesperson condemned his missive, saying, “It is Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” Shapiro himself wasn't impressed with Trump's nonsense, either. “I mean, first off, I think it’s clear over the last few years, Donald Trump is obsessed with me and obsessed with continuing to spew hate and division in our politics,"" the governor said. ""He’s someone who has routinely peddled antisemitic tropes like this. Look, remember, he’s the guy who wanted Doug Mastriano to have his job. He’s the guy who has been repeatedly rejected by the voters of Pennsylvania. He himself lost in 2020, all of his handpicked candidates have lost, and I think he’s heading for another loss — this time to Kamala Harris. ""I think you all heard me talk last night at the DNC — the exact polar opposite of what Donald Trump is talking about. I’m talking about real freedom, bringing people together, accepting folks no matter what they look like, where they come from, who they love, who they pray to and saying, 'This is a place for you.' That’s diametrically opposed to everything Donald Trump believes, and it’s clear that he’s going to continue to be the hateful, divisive person that he’s always been in this campaign. And I think given his track record, it’s clear he’s setting himself up for another defeat.”"
25,"Why Trump pointed to a made-up meeting between Harris, Putin",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 07:36:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pointed-made-meeting-harris-putin-rcna167762,"Almost immediately after Russia’s Vladimir Putin launched an invasion into Ukraine, Donald Trump has tried to blame the war on the Biden administration. The line has never made sense — even John Bolton, Trump’s former White House national security advisor, didn’t buy it — but the former president has peddled the line in recent years anyway. In a speech in North Carolina devoted to national security, however, the Republican added a new chapter to his weird story. This was the anecdote the GOP candidate shared with supporters: At that point, Trump turned to retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and asked, “Did you know that, general?” Follow MSNBC’s live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Cameras didn’t capture Kellogg’s response, but I have a hunch he wasn’t familiar the story about the Harris-Putin meeting — because it only happened in Trump’s overactive imagination. Let’s briefly review a handful of pertinent details. First, Trump still doesn’t pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris’ name correctly. Second, Harris didn’t meet with Putin ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Trump, whose relationship with reality is often fractured, appears to have simply made this up. Third, the Democratic vice president, shortly before the war began, did attend the 2022 Munich Security Conference, representing the Biden administration. Trump would apparently have people believe that the vice president’s efforts were somehow a failure, but reality suggests otherwise: Harris met with officials from U.S. allies — not with Russia’s authoritarian leader — and helped solidify the Western alliance, which has been steadfast in its opposition to Moscow’s aggression. And finally, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that if anyone should avoid talking about private and undisclosed chats with Putin, it’s the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Remember this Politico report from June 2019? Months earlier, The Washington Post reported that Trump went to “extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations” with the Russian autocrat — at one point even “taking possession” of his own interpreter’s notes after a conversation with Putin. It’s a dynamic, in other words, in which Trump has to make up an imaginary conversation between Harris and Putin, while Democrats can reference actual conversations between Trump and Putin."
26,Trump’s odd pitch: ‘Our primary focus is not to get out the vote’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 06:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-primary-focus-not-get-out-vote-election-2024-rcna167743,"Election Day 2024 is still 11 weeks away, which might seem like a long while, but early voting in some states will begin in less than a month. Common sense suggests the major party presidential nominees would be laser focused right now on get-out-the-vote strategies and pursuing as many votes as possible. Indeed, it’s how democracies work: The more votes a campaign gets, the greater the chance of success. With this in mind, it’s curious to see Donald Trump consistently downplay the need for votes as part of his Republican candidacy. NBC News reported: “We have all the votes we’ll need,” Trump added, pointing to yard signs as proof of his popularity. As a video excerpt of his remarks made clear, the former president wasn’t kidding. I’ve studied campaigns for quite a while, and I honestly can’t think of another example in which a candidate, less than a month before voters start casting ballots in a competitive race, said out loud, “Our primary focus is not to get out the vote.” If the message sounds familiar, it’s not your imagination. As we discussed roughly a month ago, the GOP candidate peddled the same line on Fox News in late July. “My instruction: We don’t need the votes, I have so many votes,” Trump said. It wasn’t a mistake. The day after June’s presidential debate, for example, the former president held a rally in Virginia and told attendees, “We don’t need votes.” A week earlier, the Republican spoke at a far-right conference and said roughly the same thing. “I tell my people, I don’t need any votes,” said Trump, who added: “We don’t need the votes.” That came on heels of the GOP candidate pushing the same line during an appearance in Detroit. “Listen, we don’t need votes,” Trump said. He added: “We don’t need votes. We have to stop — focus, don’t worry about votes.” In fact, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the former president has been pushing this line since last fall, during his party’s primary process. “You don’t have to vote,” Trump told a New Hampshire audience in October. “Don’t worry about voting. The voting — we got plenty of votes.” As best as I can tell, Trump isn’t literally telling Americans not to cast ballots. He’s instead suggesting that he’s so wildly popular, receiving support from voters will be effortless as Election Day nears. The real challenge, the former president invariably adds, is dealing with cheating and electoral fraud that definitely exist in his weird imagination, despite Trump’s inability to substantiate his conspiracy theories with evidence. In other words, every time the Republican downplays the need for votes, he’s necessarily emphasizing the need for voter intimidation tactics and voting restrictions. Given the volume and repetition of his anti-election rhetoric — Trump asked earlier this week, “Why are we having an election?” — and after his years long antipathy toward democracy, it’s tough not to find the comments unsettling. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
27,Tim Walz’s communal patriotism is a striking contrast to Trump's individualism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-22 05:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walzs-dnc-speech-was-powerfully-patriotic-sincere-rcna167373,"“We’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason — we love this country,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at the beginning of his convention speech Wednesday night. He clearly means it — it turns out you can be a skilled politician carrying out a strategy to win an election and also be sincere. In his speech, Walz showed why he offers Democrats an opportunity to reclaim patriotism, and perhaps help redefine it along the way.  For as long as I’ve been writing about politics, I’ve argued against the idea that some of us are “real” Americans and the rest of us are something else, or that some American places are more American than others. Those are pernicious ideas in a country as large and varied as ours, and one built on its ability to constantly remake and renew itself. But let’s be honest: If we put a thousand voters in a mind-reading machine and asked them to picture a “patriotic American,” certain kinds of people would come to mind. They’d look more like Walz than Vice President Kamala Harris: rural rather than urban, from the country’s middle rather than the coasts, male rather than female, and yes, probably white.  Problematic as it might be, the fact that Walz “codes” as the kind of person you just know has a flag flying from their porch means that when he talks about patriotism, he might be able to convince some people who haven’t been too open to Democrats to listen. Which is why Walz’s framing of patriotism as community is so important.  The Harris campaign has put the word “freedom” at the heart of its campaign, and Walz even sometimes describes the campaign ethos as “mind your own damn business.” But he also talks frequently about the nation as a web of commitments and obligations of care. “The family down the road — they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do, they may not love like you do, but they’re your neighbors. And you look out for them, just like they do for you,” he said in his speech. “Everybody belongs, and everybody has a responsibility to contribute.” It’s a striking contrast with the Republican ticket, whose understanding of patriotism doesn’t have much to do with neighborliness. Walz’s counterpart, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said in his convention speech that “the source of American greatness” can be found where his family is from in Kentucky, not because it represents American ideals, but because it “is our homeland. People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home.” But Vance doesn’t have much to say about what it means to live in that home. The contrast is even more stark when we consider what Donald Trump has to say about patriotism. He has a schtick he does in which he literally hugs and kisses an American flag, which always gets a laugh from the MAGA faithful. It’s supposed to communicate that he loves his country but his brand of patriotism is utterly hollow. America is our team, we hate all the other teams, and that’s about as deep as it goes. Trump substitutes nationalism for patriotism, insisting that love for America is found in fear and animosity toward the rest of the world.   Think about it this way: What exactly is it about America that Donald Trump loves? Have we ever heard him speak about the extraordinary diversity of our places and people, or our amazing achievements in science and culture, or the majesty of our national parks? Of course not. If you asked him why it is that people across the world dream of coming here, his only answer would be that we have to keep them out.  And when he isn’t in power, he can’t help but describe the country in ways that drip with contempt. As far as Trump’s concerned, this is a land of mayhem and misery, full of losers and suckers who are worthy of nothing but scorn. And he has a particular affection for those who committed treason against America so they could keep other Americans enslaved. That Trump can say the things he does and still claim to be patriotic only reminds liberals of how long they have been targeted with accusations of insufficient patriotism. It was particularly acute in the years following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and into the Iraq War, when anyone who raised questions about the unfolding disaster of American foreign policy was liable to be told they hated America and were siding with “the terrorists.”  Which makes it all the more heartening to see an all-American guy like Tim Walz make a plea for a different kind of patriotism. At the end of his speech, Walz implored Democrats to work hard in the remaining time before the election. “That’s how we make America a place where no child is left hungry,” he said. “Where no community is left behind. Where nobody gets told they don’t belong.” If he and Harris keep emphasizing that this vision of inclusiveness, care and common fate is at the heart of patriotism, they might just convince a few people that it’s about more than whether you hug a flag."
28,I worked in Trump’s White House. Here’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-21 14:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/former-trump-white-house-staffer-olivia-troye-voting-kamala-harris-rcna167352,"I am a lifelong Republican who worked in the Trump White House, and the truth is that I’d rather be backing a candidate from my own party for president. But, for voters who care about preserving our democracy, our freedoms and opportunities, and our country’s standing around the world, there’s only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.  I left the Trump White House in August 2020 because I saw the danger Donald Trump posed for our country. This year, I joined Republicans for Harris, a coalition that gives voice to the millions of Republicans like me and independent voters who continue to reject the extremism and division of Trump. Trump weakened our standing on the world stage, damaged our institutions at home, and restricted our freedoms. He endangers our allies, says he’d allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to “do whatever the hell” he wants to them, and has threatened to withdraw the United States from NATO.  After losing in 2020, Trump tried to overturn a free and fair election, put his own vice president’s life in danger, and unleashed a violent mob on the U.S. Capitol that left five law enforcement officers dead. And still, the Republican Party stood by him. In the three years since, Trump has become even more unhinged, dangerous and extreme. His entire presidential campaign for 2024 is premised on seeking revenge on his political opponents. Just last week, he attacked the Republican governor of Georgia’s wife and family — who support him — since Gov. Brian Kemp was unwilling to lie about the results of the 2020 election.  Trump wants to be a dictator on day one and his MAGA loyalists are all too willing to let it happen. When a political party bends to the will of a single person and puts them on a pedestal, they’re putting party above country at the expense of the integrity of our institutions and the dignity of our democracy. It’s disgraceful. This is not the Republican Party I know and it’s certainly not a Republican Party I can support.  The good news is, we have another option in this election: someone who values democracy, will uphold the rule of law, and who is prepared to stand with our allies and provide steady leadership to the world.  Vice President Kamala Harris is building a broad coalition that includes everyone because, unlike her opponent, she knows that a president’s job is to serve all Americans, not only those who vote for her.  She will protect our freedoms — including women’s right to make their own health care decisions, while Trump wants to ban access to vital reproductive health care. She will stand by our global partners, from Israel to Ukraine to our NATO allies. She will defend our democracy and ensure we remain a nation in which nobody is above the law. She will work with anyone who’s willing to come to the table, on either side of the aisle, to deliver real results for the American people. It’s why I endorsed Harris, and it’s why I’m a proud member of Republicans for Harris.  To my fellow conservatives: The Republican Party has abandoned you. It’s not too late to reject Trump’s chaos and stand with Kamala Harris, who will defend our democracy and fight for our freedoms.  Harris has a vision for the future of our nation. Trump only wants to drag us back into the past. We have an opportunity to be part of that future, to reshape the Republican Party and to restore America’s leadership. We have a chance to join Republicans for Harris and play a part in protecting America from Trump’s MAGA party. This is the way to reset politics toward principles and end Trump’s dead-end populist movement. Our conservative values guide us to make this choice because our country and democracy depend on it."

If you’re a conservative from the South, I’m sure there’s one word this election cycle that’s stuck out to you: freedom. It’s a word that’s traditionally been used by Republicans, but this time around it’s become central to the Democratic Party’s message. When I see the word “freedom” plastered on signs at the Democratic National Convention, I see the Democratic Party stepping forward — and stepping right through a door that Donald Trump and the United States Supreme Court opened for them with the Dobbs decision. Democrats are telling the American people: No, we’re not going to let the federal government control your body. We’re not going to force women to carry their rapist's babies to term. We’re not going to have state-forced birth for a 10-year-old girl. We’re not going to turn our eyes away from women who are bleeding out outside of emergency rooms. Democrats have taken the idea of freedom away from the Republican Party and the American people are taking notice.  One of the more compelling things I’ve heard from a voter this election cycle came from a self-identified libertarian who said they were concerned about Republicans pushing to take control of people’s bodies and people’s health care.  They asked: If they’re doing it to women this year, what are they going to do to the rest of us next year?"

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Ada Brown set aside the rule nationwide, which had been scheduled to take effect Sept. 4, siding with business interests including the Chamber of Commerce. Brown concluded that the Federal Trade Commission lacked authority to issue the rule and deemed it “arbitrary and capricious because it is unreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation.”  Announcing the rule in April, FTC Chair Lina Khan said that noncompete clauses “keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism” and that the rule “will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.” An FTC spokesperson said after the ruling that the agency was seriously considering appealing and noted that the judge’s decision doesn’t prevent the agency “from addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions.” The government’s prospects on appeal aren’t great, however, given this Supreme Court has been broadly skeptical of agency authority and has struck down Biden administration initiatives. The intermediate federal appeals court covering Texas is the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings have sometimes gone too far right even for the Supreme Court.

On Tuesday, a Donald Trump campaign spokesperson appeared to co-opt the song, using it in a video of the former president deplaning in Michigan for a campaign event. “Touchdown in Michigan!!” Steven Cheung wrote in the post on X. He also tagged Trump, who recently returned to the platform. The Trump campaign has used songs without artists’ permission over the years. Several musicians or their estates have asked Trump to stop using their songs at his rallies, and some have threatened legal action. The GOP campaign spokesperson’s use of a song that Harris had established as her anthem of sorts is somewhat ironic. Trump recently accused the Democratic nominee of stealing his proposal to end taxes on tips, a policy she floated earlier this month and one he initially put forward in June. (Though neither candidate has released their full plan, many economists have criticized the idea, saying it would result in workers pressuring customers to tip more and encourage Americans to declare more of their income as tips.)

32,"Trump headlines Moms for Liberty summit, despite trying to distance himself from Project 2025",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-31 09:29:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-moms-for-liberty-heritage-foundation-project-2025-rcna169087,"At the Moms for Liberty annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Donald Trump aired grievances about his political rivals and leaned into culture war issues. In his ""fireside chat,"" he attacked President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and he disparaged trans people and migrants crossing the U.S. border. But aside from his ramblings — which The Guardian described as ""long, zigzagging and at times incoherent"" — the Republican presidential nominee's appearance at the event also underscored his connection to the Heritage Foundation, the architects behind the Project 2025 plan that Trump has taken pains to distance himself from. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization that has served as a personnel pipeline to GOP administrations and crafted policy proposals that have been picked up by Republican officials, has ties to the far-right Moms for Liberty, which has been labeled an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 2022, the organization awarded Moms for Liberty its Salvatori Prize for Citizenship, which came with a $25,000 cash award, according to its tax filing that year. The Heritage Foundation is also one of 10 sponsors of the Moms for Liberty summit this year, as The Washington Post reported. And Moms for Liberty is listed as a “coalition partner” for Project 2025, an action plan for Trump’s second term that was drafted by the Heritage Foundation. Amid public backlash to Project 2025, Trump has tried to separate himself from the document, despite a number of allies and former Trump administration officials' involvement in drafting it. He has disavowed the project and claimed ignorance of the people behind it. But his politics inherently tie him to the organization's sphere of influence, and supporters of Project 2025 have likened Trump's public rejection of the plan to ""two siblings in a fight."" Trump's appearance at the Moms for Liberty event further undermines those efforts. At the event on Friday, he received a personal endorsement from Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, who said that while the group is ""nonpartisan,"" she personally supports Trump for president."
33,JD Vance nags billionaire Peter Thiel to throw money at Donald Trump's campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 14:15:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-peter-thiel-donations-rcna169051,"Republicans are shook over Democrats’ fundraising efforts, and we’re starting to see them look for ways to change the momentum.  One sign? Sen. JD Vance is pushing his billionaire benefactor and mentor, Peter Thiel, to throw his financial heft behind the Trump campaign. Thiel, who shares elements of Vance’s brand of far-right, technocratic illiberalism, supported Trump in 2016 and helped fund the senator’s 2022 election bid, but this year Thiel has said he’s not interested in endorsing a candidate after his disappointment with Trump’s presidency. Thiel did say he might change his mind, though. Vance appears to be banking on it.  “I’m going to keep on talking to Peter and persuading him that — you know he’s obviously been exhausted by politics a little bit — but he’s going to be really exhausted by politics if we lose and if Kamala Harris is president,” Vance said in an interview with the Financial Times. “He is fundamentally a conservative guy, and I think that he needs to get off the sidelines and support the ticket.” (A representative for Thiel did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.) Vance is taking a slightly different approach than Trump, who in recent months has openly threatened CEOs who don’t endorse him. And without subpoena power of his own, Vance has also been forced to take a different approach than House Republicans and Republican attorneys general, who’ve opened investigations into the fundraising platform ActBlue, which Democrats have used to notch historic fundraising hauls since Vice President Kamala Harris entrance into the race. “These inquiries point to unspecified allegations of possible foreign money laundering or identity theft supposedly being carried out by bad actors on ActBlue,” Fast Company reported. ActBlue told the outlet, “in 2024, it is all too commonplace to see attempts to spread disinformation from the far-right and our organization is prepared to address the bad actors.” Recent fundraising data give us some insight into what may be driving Republican concerns. The Harris campaign significantly out-raised the Trump campaign in July, which The Washington Post notes may allow her “to air more ads and maintain a larger payroll than her Republican opponent in the final months of the race for the White House.”  There are already signs that the huge fundraising hauls Team Harris has raked in have allowed it to reach out to voters in areas Democrats might have otherwise deprioritized without so much cash on hand. This week, they launched an ad campaign in the area around Trump’s home in Florida.  When you consider all of that, it seems clear why Vance would be pushing for his party's top cash cow to get out of the barn and into the milking shed."
34,"Nearly six weeks later, Trump can’t shake his fixation on Biden",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 12:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nearly-six-weeks-later-trump-cant-shake-fixation-biden-rcna169047,"At Donald Trump’s latest campaign rally in Michigan, Donald Trump started to share some conspiracy theories about independent polls — which the former president is convinced are “rigged” — when he had a related thought. “You know, we were up massively by Biden,” the Republican said. “How would you like to be me? I spent $100 million on beating Biden.” Moments later, in case the sentiment wasn’t clear the first time, he again said, “I spent $100 million on fighting him.” It was a timely reminder, as a HuffPost report put it this week, “Donald Trump just can’t quit Joe Biden.” For those keeping score, President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21, which was roughly 40 days ago. Common sense suggests Trump, with fewer than 10 weeks remaining before Election Day 2024, would be focusing all of his attention on Harris and not the retiring incumbent. And yet, there was the former president this week, publishing an item to his social media platform that read, “You know, if Biden didn’t do the Debate, he would be the Democrat Candidate for President right now. The fact is, Debate or no Debate, the Democrats really did a number on him!!!” At face value, the GOP candidate’s missive wasn’t wrong — but it was irrelevant given the circumstances. It was nevertheless part of a larger pattern. The day before Trump published that item to his platform, he was in Michigan, whining about Biden ending his candidacy. Six days earlier, the Republican also complained that Biden’s exit was “not fair.” In the preceding days, Trump made related comments, longing for the days in which the incumbent was still running, over and over and over again. What’s more, when the GOP nominee isn’t attacking Biden for no reason, and pleading for Biden to stick around, Trump is peddling fan-fiction about the Democratic president re-entering the 2024 race. To be sure, I’m well aware of the Republican’s motivations. As we’ve discussed, Trump was feeling quite good about the state of the race when Biden was still his opponent. The former president was ahead in the polls; Democrats were divided; and much of the national analysis was about the expanding electoral map, as traditional “blue” states started to appear more competitive. The Republican had reason to be pleased: He was winning. Indeed, Trump’s assumptions about his inevitable victory contributed to his decision to pick an unpopular far-right running mate: As the GOP nominee saw it, he could get away with adding Sen. JD Vance to the ticket — as opposed to a qualified candidate with broader electoral appeal — because the race was effectively over. And now it’s not. But while the former president’s frustrations are understandable, they’re also increasingly pitiful. Biden is retiring after a half-century of honorable public service. The quicker Trump comes to terms with the new landscape, the better off he’ll be. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
35,Why Trump’s new line on IVF is so difficult to take seriously,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 08:20:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-line-ivf-difficult-take-seriously-rcna168975,"A week, apropos of nothing, Donald Trump published a one-sentence missive to his social media platform. “The Republican Party is charging forward on many fronts,” the former president wrote, “and I am very proud that we are a LEADER on I.V.F.” And what, pray tell, would that mean in practice? Six days later, a possible answer came into sharper focus. NBC News reported: “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump said before adding, “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.” The wording led to some confusion about the relevant policy details. Does the Republican nominee, who didn’t pursue anything along these lines during his four years in the White House, envision a model in which the federal government would pick up the tab for IVF services — comparable to an existing policy on dialysis — or one in which private insurers would be forced to cover the costs? When NBC News sought clarification, the former president said that one option would be to have insurance companies pay “under a mandate, yes.” When CNN asked vice presidential nominee JD Vance how this would work in states that ban IVF, he didn’t have much of an answer, either. It seems, in other words, as if Team Trump has some homework to do when it comes to how all of this would work. Still, this is an unusually progressive announcement from a radically far-right candidate, isn’t it? It would be, if the GOP candidate’s rhetoric were believable. Indeed, the Harris campaign responded to the news with a press statement featuring several notable bullet points: We could go further down this same path, noting just how many of Trump’s own allies are looking forward to his prospective second term precisely so that they can undermine IVF access. For that matter, given that Trump tried to repeal, undermine, and sabotage the Affordable Care Act, it’s probably best to take all of his promises related to health care with a grain of salt. But I’m also struck by the broader policy circumstances. For many years, Republicans have condemned the idea of socialized health care coverage and staunchly opposed private insurance benefit mandates. And yet, here’s Trump, looking for a winning campaign issue, insisting that Americans’ IVF treatments will be covered, either through socialized health care coverage or a private insurance benefit mandate. The party’s principles on health care are firm and inviolable — except when they’re not."
36,New details suggest Trump’s Arlington controversy won’t end soon,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-30 05:55:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-details-suggest-trumps-arlington-controversy-wont-end-soon-rcna168944,"Donald Trump’s Arlington National Cemetery controversy was already a mess for the former president, though a statement from the U.S. Army took the fiasco to a new level on Thursday morning. An Army spokesperson began by emphasizing, in writing, that those participating in Monday’s wreath-laying ceremony were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and Pentagon policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds. But just as notably, the Army spokesperson went on to explain that an employee who works at the cemetery attempted to ensure adherence to the rules when she was “abruptly pushed aside,” despite Trump campaign denials about a physical altercation. According to the Army, the employee “acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption.” In case this isn’t obvious, the Army generally goes out of its way to avoid issuing provocative statements related to politicians, especially during a campaign, but in this case, the branch made an exception. For his part, the Republican nominee delivered public remarks on the matter for the first time hours later, misstated the date of his visit to Arlington, bragged about being on time for the event at the cemetery, characterized himself as a victim of smear, and concluded that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “killed” American service members in Afghanistan. If that sounds ridiculous and offensive, it’s because it was ridiculous and offensive. Around the same time, Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, on the heels of publicly criticizing the official who works at the cemetery, issued a statement online that called the office of the Army Secretary a bunch of “hacks.” So to recap, the former president — who remains burdened by a dreadful record related to respecting U.S. troops and veterans — isn’t just caught up in a controversy about exploiting one of the nation’s most sacred spaces and ignoring Arlington’s rules against politicization, his campaign team is simultaneously picking a public fight with the United States Army less than 10 weeks from Election Day. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, there’s a burgeoning conversation about uncovering answers that have not yet reached the public. Politico reported: VoteVets, a progressive veterans group, wasted little time in throwing its public support behind the Democratic senator’s efforts, and there’s a related push underway from several House Democrats. Mark Esper, who served as Trump’s Defense Secretary, has also called for an investigation into the incident. Where will the controversy go next? Watch this space."
37,Dems played Trump’s game better than he does on Night 2 of the DNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-21 10:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/night-2-dnc-obamas-pritzker-trump-roast-rcna167577,"Democrats turned Night 2 of the Democratic National Convention into a full-on Donald Trump roast session. The best mockery all shared a consistent theme: Trump is too small a man to be deserving of the presidency because America has outgrown his petulant, self-serving type of leadership. Tuesday was cathartic for those in the Democratic Party who wanted to see Democrats show some resolve by fighting back against Trump’s unhinged insults with a lil’ flavor of their own. And many of them delivered with some pointed jabs at his self-image.  Trump and his followers like to portray him as a larger-than-life figure — an icon, an American idol. But with their carefully placed digs, Democrats brought him down to size with remarks about his smallness or weakness: his unimpressive intellect, his juvenile self-obsession, his unstable finances, and his petty competitiveness about … crowd sizes. Here are some of my highlights: Former President Barack Obama’s quip mocking Trump’s weird focus on crowd sizes — and the, shall we say, suggestive hand gesture Obama made while cracking the joke — have taken the internet by storm. Seriously, great comedic timing from Obama here. But the underlying point was a powerful one: Trump is too concerned with trivial score-setting to be an effective president. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s remarks about Trump’s rabid attacks on her and her husband over the years portrayed Trump as a petty bigot. A man too small-minded and self-conscious to respect two hard-working Black people who ascended to great heights on their own merit — and, unlike him, couldn’t “expect an escalator to take us to the top” when confronted with a mountain. “His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black,” she said. U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks lobbed a similar attack when she claimed Trump and his movement have consumed America’s focus and limited our political imagination.  The Maryland Democrat said:  Other than Barack Obama, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker may have hurt Trump’s ego the most with his comments mocking Trump’s finances and his intelligence at once. ""Donald Trump thinks that we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich,” Pritzker said. “But take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”  Pritzker and his fellow Democrats had the DNC feeling like Def Comedy Jam at points on Tuesday, which clearly played well in the room and online. But importantly, they used those jokes to pivot to the very real, very serious discussion about the threat a second Trump election might pose to American democracy. Good speechcraft all around."
38,Trump seems to think he has an airtight defense for visiting a KKK hotbed in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-21 09:04:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-howell-michigan-kkk-white-supremacists-rcna167460,"Donald Trump’s appearance in Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday sparked controversy before he even arrived. That’s because the visit continued his notable tradition of scheduling campaign stops in locations known as hotbeds for racist extremism. Just last month, a group of white supremacists marched in Howell and expressed their support for Trump and Adolf Hitler. As journalist Jon King wrote for the Michigan Advance, the event evoked memories of Howell’s racist — and in some cases, fairly recent — history of public bigotry and the Ku Klux Klan. So this was certainly a peculiar location for Trump to host a rally — especially when you consider that he has said nothing about the white supremacist gathering there in July and that he has a history of similar scheduling controversies. Last year, for example, he held a rally in Waco, Texas, shortly after the 30th anniversary of the deadly standoff between Branch Davidians (aka cultists) and law enforcement. Trump’s speech at that rally, in which he vowed “I am your retribution,” definitely gave off David Koresh vibes. And in 2020, Trump reversed course and rescheduled a planned Juneteenth rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where in 1921 white mobs waged one of the deadliest race riots in history — killing as many as 300 Black people. As a matter of fact, Trump is set to speak Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, where members of a pro-Trump chapter of the KKK sought to hold a cross-burning in 2017. But Trump seems to think he found an airtight defense for his Michigan visit. When a reporter on Tuesday asked about his response to criticism over his visit, he responded with a question of his own: “Who was here in 2021?” The answer he was fishing for — and received — was “Joe Biden.” Of course, the big difference is that the president wasn’t visiting right after racists praised him and Hitler simultaneously. In a statement, the Harris-Walz campaign slammed Trump for his refusal “to condemn the white supremacists who marched in his name.” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat whose district includes Howell, was critical as well, writing on X that Trump “didn’t come to Howell today to bring people together, to call out that hateful behavior, or to offer any kind of hopeful vision for the future.” She said the visit “risks reopening old wounds” and added: “Real leaders should take the opportunity to condemn the hatred that has been on display.” I’ll note that one simple way for Trump to dissociate from the racists in Howell might have been for him to avoid doing anything that suggests he shares the same bigoted ideology. But unfortunately for him, at one point Tuesday he seemed to openly fantasize about deploying the police at election time, harkening back to periods of unfettered displays of white supremacy in the U.S. Methinks the Howell visit might not be entirely coincidental."
39,"Reality gets in the way of Trump’s line on crime, law enforcement",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-21 07:42:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/reality-gets-way-trumps-line-crime-law-enforcement-rcna167545,"Donald Trump and his campaign team apparently had a simple plan: The former president would go to Michigan and talk about crime, which is an issue the Republican sees as electoral strength, despite his criminal record. The trouble, of course, is that reality got in the way of the pitch. The Trump campaign, for example, had told The Detroit News that the GOP candidate would agree to an interview, but as the newspaper reported, after the News “began asking about the Michigan crime data before the event, a campaign aide said the presidential candidate no longer had time for an interview.” Imagine that. Trump declared in Michigan that there’s an ongoing “crime wave” that’s reached levels “nobody has ever seen before.” He was, of course, lying: Though crime rates spiked toward the end of his failed presidency, the United States has seen a dramatic turnaround in recent years. When Team Trump came to realize that the Detroit News might ask the former president to contend with the truth, a scheduled interview opportunity quickly disappeared. The Republican clearly preferred to bask in his alternate reality. In big cities “almost all run by Democrats,” Trump added, “you can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot. You get mugged. You get raped. You get whatever it may be.” This was demonstrably ridiculous. Trump obviously didn’t care — and it wasn’t the only lie he peddled during the event. But stepping back, the larger point of the event was apparently to position the GOP candidate as an ally of law enforcement. Indeed, Trump spoke at the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office surrounded by deputies in uniform, in front of parked police SUVs. After the remarks, he posted an item to his social media platform with the words “BACK THE BLUE” superimposed over his photograph. The point, obviously, was to suggest to voters that Trump is aligned with law enforcement. But just as actual crime rates get in the way of the former president’s campaign pitch, Trump’s record gets in the way of his alliance with the police. Consider the newly revised list of The Top 10 Reasons Donald Trump Deserves To Be Seen As An Opponent Of Law Enforcement. 10. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and accused law enforcement officials of pushing “fake” crime rate statistics as part of a political plot to help Democrats. 9. A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies, and he’s still facing dozens of other criminal counts across multiple jurisdictions. 8. Trump is facing civil suits from police officers who sustained injuries during the Jan. 6 riot the Republican instigated. 7. Trump has condemned common law enforcement tools, including plea agreements for witnesses who cooperate with prosecutors. 6. Trump abused his powers by intervening in criminal cases in which the defendants were political allies, letting politically connected suspects go free — even after some pleaded guilty — and undermining law enforcement in the process. 5. Trump has undermined law enforcement by abusing his pardon powers, in one case even commuting the sentence of a man accused of helping murder of a police officer. 4. Trump lashed out at the police officer who shot Ashli Babbitt as a “thug” and a “coward” who deserves to be vilified. 3. Trump has promised day-one pardons for insurrectionists, many of whom violently clashed with police officers. 2. While in office, Trump saw law enforcement as a political weapon he can wield at his convenience, which led him to urge law enforcement officials to enforce his political vendettas and help Republicans win elections. 1. Trump has expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a sycophantic supporter of the former president, recently declared via social media, “No one Backs The Blue more than President Trump.” There’s ample evidence to the contrary. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

The party and its officials eagerly remind voters that the Republican is dangerous and radical, dishonest and corrupt, ignorant and hateful. The assessments, of course, are rooted in fact. But one of the striking things about the respective Democratic National Convention speeches from Michelle and Barack Obama was their willingness to make a different kind of case against the GOP nominee: Trump, the Obamas effectively argued, is small and tiresome. From the former first lady’s remarks: Subtle, it was not. To be sure, both of the Obamas spent the bulk of their speeches touting the incumbent vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the Democratic ticket’s vision, but some of the most memorable parts of their remarks were their takedowns of the Republican candidate. “For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” the former first lady added. “See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black. I want to know, who’s going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs? “It’s his same old con. Doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better. “Look, because cutting our health care, taking away our freedom to control our bodies, the freedom to become a mother through I.V.F., like I did — those things are not going to improve the health outcomes of our wives, mothers and daughters. Shutting down the Department of Education, banning our books — none of that will prepare our kids for the future. Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love, look, that doesn’t make anybody’s life better. Instead, instead, it only makes us small. And let me tell you this: Going small is never the answer. Going small is the opposite of what we teach our kids. Going small is petty. It’s unhealthy. And quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.” If there was a time when Michelle Obama pulled her punches, that time has passed. Her husband’s assessment dovetailed nicely with hers. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago,” the former president said. “It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that’s actually been getting worse now that he is afraid of losing to Kamala. There’s the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. It just goes on and on and on. The other day, I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day.” When Obama referenced Trump’s weird obsession with crowd sizes, pay particular attention to what he did with his hands: “Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided: between us and them, between the real Americans who, of course, support him and the outsiders who don’t,” Obama added. “And he wants you to think that you’ll be richer and safer if you will just give him the power to put those other people back in their place. It is one of the oldest tricks in politics, from a guy whose act has — let’s face it — gotten pretty stale. We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.” As eviscerations go, the Obamas weren’t just pitch-perfect, they also delivered remarks that won’t soon be forgotten."
41,Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing in Michigan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-21 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-howell-michigan-speech-crime-rcna167365,"Former President Donald Trump stood before the media on Tuesday afternoon to lie about crime. This isn’t the first time he has fabricated fictions about violent immigrants streaming across the border or cities under an onslaught of criminally violent minorities, crumbling pillars of the Republican case against Vice President Kamala Harris. But it was the setting, outside the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office in Howell, Michigan, that infused his rambling with an even darker undertone than normal. I don’t remember when I first learned about Howell’s association with the Ku Klux Klan. I’m not a native of Michigan; my family moved there the year I turned 12. But by the time I was in college, it was a readily understood “joke” among my friends that there’d be no stopping for gas in Howell if I was in the car. I would stare at the signage on the interstate as we’d cruise past, grateful the tank was nowhere near empty. In the 1970s and ’80s, at the peak of the city’s links to the white supremacist movement, Robert Miles, the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, had a Howell mailing address and was known to hold rallies on a nearby farm property. Black residents of nearby Detroit knew full well not to set foot in the town, a belief that — if it hasn’t expired — lasted at minimum deep into the early 2000s. The city has worked hard to shake that association with hate movements, a project that was damaged last month during a previous Trump visit to Michigan. Though the campaign rally held that day was across the state in Grand Rapids, a small group of masked white supremacists marched through downtown Howell chanting “Heil Hitler.” Later that day, another demonstration was held on a highway overpass, featuring a swastika flag and people chanting, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” I want to stress that this was only a dozen or so racists and that the city’s officials don’t support the hatefulness that was displayed. “Although we recognize their right to free speech, these demonstrators do not reflect the values of the Howell community,” the city said in a statement at the time. But it’s not a stretch to say that the men who gathered that day knew the significance of the location they’d picked. Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy tried to de-emphasize the matter in a Facebook post ahead of Trump’s visit. “Within the last month, there’s been a couple of folks that have come here to cause a little bit of a stir, spew some hate speech, white supremacy crap,” he said in the video. He also denied that Trump’s appearance was meant to be a political event, calling it a “press conference,” instead. Notably, though, Trump didn’t take a single question from the assembled reporters after delivering his remarks, which sounded like his usual stump speech sprinkled with a few dodgy statistics. I’ve been unable to figure out whose figures he was supposedly citing when he claimed that crime had spiked since Vice President Kamala Harris took office. In reality, we’ve seen major declines in violent crime since a peak in 2020, both across the country and especially in Detroit. But the supposed statistics he was offering were less important than the rhetoric surrounding them. This was an audience that Trump wanted to hear this particular diatribe. Like his presidency, Trump’s presidential campaigns have always been in a constant state of dissonance between a claimed respect for law and order and a flagrant flouting of the rule of law. He has been quick to sidle up to the police and stoke their belief that any mention of accountability is a grave attack upon them. In speaking with Murphy and several deputies standing behind him, Trump clearly sought to project strength to a sympathetic audience who would accept his entirely vibes-based argument that there’s a “Kamala crime wave.” The thing is, though, that’s a point that Trump could have made standing in front of SUVs emblazoned with a sheriff’s logo in any small town in any swing state in the country. Howell’s history, both long-term and recent, sets it apart. The same could be easily said about Trump’s decision to hold a rally in Waco, Texas, to defend the Jan. 6 rioters. It was likewise similar to presidential candidate Ronald Reagan’s choice in 1980 to give a speech about state’s rights at the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi. Neshoba is the county where civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney had been kidnapped and murdered 16 years earlier. Reagan made the deliberate choice to speak there to win over lingering segregationists in the state. There is no world in which Trump’s team didn’t understand the significance of holding that event in Howell. That he did so is to the great detriment of the people who have worked to show they now outnumber the cowards who chanted antisemitic comments and expressed support for Trump from behind masks last month. Howell is not the place it was in the 1970s and ’80s — but as we saw last month, there are people who hope that it can be again if Trump is returned to leadership. They chanted, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” Trump hasn’t even condemned them."
42,Could Taylor Swift sue Trump over his social media post?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 14:28:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/taylor-swift-sue-trump-truth-social-post-ai-rcna167380,"Could Taylor Swift sue Donald Trump? The question arises after the GOP presidential nominee shared several images (some generated by artificial intelligence) on his social media platform suggesting that the singer and her fans support his campaign. One of the images portrayed Swift’s likeness in Uncle Sam-style fashion, accompanied by the text: “Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.” The former president added: “I accept!” Swift could sue. And while there are any number of reasons that the pop star won’t expend the effort of taking Trump to court, one legal area that could be relevant is the right of publicity, which protects people from certain forms of unauthorized exploitation. That subject arose in another high-profile context recently, when OpenAI developed a chatbot voice assistant that sounded much like Scarlett Johansson; the company subsequently pulled it after public scrutiny, but denied that it was an imitation of the actor’s voice. (Representatives for Trump’s campaign and Swift didn’t immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.) Trump’s post comes as many legal questions remain unanswered in this era of AI proliferation and the internet. There isn’t presently reason to think that this episode will become a legal case that tests those frontiers — saying nothing of whatever would come of such a case, including any defenses (including on First Amendment grounds) that Trump would seek to raise. But if he continues to potentially antagonize the star, whose political sympathies seem to lie elsewhere, we may find out how much of a case she has.

43,Will Trump keep his promise about releasing his medical records?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 11:28:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/will-trump-keep-promise-releasing-medical-records-rcna167411,"It’s been more than five weeks since Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, though the former president and his political operation have been less than transparent about the medical care he received and the nature of his injuries. It was against this backdrop that CBS News asked the Republican nominee a good question this week. At that point, the GOP candidate proceeded to talk about his “perfect score” on a cognitive test — a subject he’s long struggled to understand — and his belief that every candidate should take one. Trump did not say, however, why he hasn’t yet released his latest medical records to the public, or how long it will take for him to “very gladly” follow up on his promise. Time will tell whether the Republican keeps his word, and given recent history, there’s reason for great skepticism. Indeed, as regular readers know, he’s long adopted a rather untraditional approach to sharing information about his medical exams. It started before he took office. In late 2015, during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Team Trump released an unintentionally hilarious, four-paragraph letter from the late Dr. Harold Bornstein, asserting that Trump’s “physical strength and stamina are extraordinary” and that his lab tests results were “astonishingly excellent.” The doctor added at the time, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” We learned several months later that Bornstein wrote the letter in five minutes while a limo, dispatched by Trump, waited for the document. In the years that followed, disclosures did not improve. Last fall, Trump released the first updated report on his health in more than three years, but it came by way of a statement issued by one of his golf club customers, and it omitted basic details such as his blood pressure and medications. More recently, the former president and his team also ignored calls for medical details after he was shot in the ear. As of this week, however, the GOP candidate made it sound like he’d be only too pleased to share his medical records with the public. If this actually happens, it’ll be a pleasant change of pace — which is why I’m not holding my breath. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
44,Officials confirm: Iranian hackers breached Trump’s 2024 campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 06:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/officials-confirm-iranian-hackers-breached-trumps-2024-campaign-rcna167333,"It was 10 days ago when Donald Trump’s campaign said that it had been hacked by an Iranian group in June. As it turns out, the claims were apparently true. NBC News reported: “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” the agencies said in the statement. The fact that the joint statement referenced the “campaigns” was notable in part because Team Trump apparently wasn’t the only target. NBC News’ report added, “The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked.” Iran, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing. To date, news organizations have not published any of the information obtained from Trump’s political operation, which is certainly in line with the Republican campaign’s appeals. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process,” Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement when the allegations first reached the public. Team Trump added, “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” At first blush, that statement seemed largely unremarkable. In fact, what Cheung claimed turned out to be true: Team Trump was breached; documents were obtained illegally; the thieves were apparently foreign adversaries; and their goal was to interfere in an American presidential election. There is, however, a disconnect between the message and the messenger. As Robert Schlesinger explained in a piece for The New Republic: Quite right. In 2016, when it was Russia targeting the U.S. presidential election and exposing materials stolen from Democratic computers, Trump celebrated WikiLeaks, cheered on his benefactors in Moscow and publicly urged Americans to embrace the hack and its ill-gotten gains. At the time, it was Democrats who issued statements such as, “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” And it was Trump who effectively said, “I don’t care.” As far as the Republican is concerned, documents obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to sow chaos throughout our democratic process, must be rejected — unless they benefit his quest for power."
45,The feud continues: John Kelly rejects Trump’s Medal of Honor line,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/feud-john-kelly-rejects-donald-trump-medal-honor-election-2024-rcna167321,"Donald Trump’s lengthy record of disparaging military service took a turn for the worse last week when the former president said the Presidential Medal of Freedom was “much better” than the Medal of Honor because those who receive the nation’s highest military honor are often wounded or dead. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, among others, condemned the rhetoric as “asinine.” In an interview with an NBC affiliate in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, which aired on Sunday night, the Republican tried to clarify his position, though he effectively just reiterated the comments that sparked the original controversy. Trump’s former White House chief of staff saw his former boss’ comments and apparently felt compelled to condemn what he heard. CNN reported: “Think of Normandy, Iwo Jima, Vietnam or Fallujah,” Kelly told CNN. “The Medal of Honor is earned, not won, by incredibly brave actions on the battlefield under fire typically by very young men who joined when others did not to defend their country. Their oath to the nation is essentially the oath the president and members of Congress take, that federal judges take, that political appointees also take and includes ‘...that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties...’ “To the service member, the oath is sacred and taken with the understanding that one could be seriously wounded, captured or killed in living up to the words. No president, member of Congress, judge or political appointee — and certainly no recipient of the Presidential Medal — will ever be asked to give life or limb to protect the Constitution. The two awards cannot be compared in any way. Not even close.” In terms of accuracy and propriety, there can be no doubt that the retired four-star Marine general has the facts on his side. But stepping back, it’s also worth emphasizing the fact that it’s remarkable to see the former president and his former White House chief of staff repeatedly clashing as the election season progresses. As recently as late June, Trump, unprompted, lashed out at Kelly as “dumb” and a “lost soul.” Months earlier, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” There was no great mystery as to the motivation for the offensive. After all, Kelly is the one who confirmed on the record that Trump really did denigrate American servicemembers as “suckers and losers.” “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly told CNN in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of, among other things, “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues,” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. The fact that the Republican nominee is publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
46,Why Judge Merchan shouldn’t delay Trump’s New York sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-20 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-sentencing-delay-merchan-alvin-bragg-manhattan-rcna167236,"Former President Donald Trump’s effort to dodge accountability for his crimes is still going strong. It’s not just his unhinged campaign for president, which represents an attempt to avoid prison. He has also continued pushing for delays in all four criminal cases against him, most recently demanding his criminal sentencing in Manhattan be delayed until after the election. Because there is no basis for this latest delay under the law and Trump’s political purposes are so obvious, the court should reject this out of hand. Trump was convicted back in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, all to cover up interfering in the 2016 presidential election by paying hush money to an adult film actress to hide their affair. Having already successfully postponed his sentencing from July 11 to Sept. 18, Trump’s attorneys recently asked Judge Juan Merchan to further postpone it until after Election Day. In response, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office on Monday deferred to the judge’s discretion but noted “there are strong reasons” that Trump’s position should be rejected.  Under New York sentencing law, the test Merchan must apply is whether the delay is “reasonable.” It is anything but. For starters, Trump’s motion for delay cites the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. U.S., which provides at least presumptive immunity for official acts. On Sept. 16, two days before the current sentencing date, Merchan will rule on Trump’s motion to vacate his conviction on the basis of that immunity ruling. Trump’s lawyers claim that he cannot be sentenced until after any appeals of the Sept. 16 decision are fully and finally resolved.  Huh? Whatever may be said about the mix of official and unofficial acts at issue in the 2020 attempted coup, which was the subject of the Supreme Court’s decision, the Manhattan case clearly concerns unofficial conduct. As the DA’s office explained in a separate and meticulously detailed filing last month, a presidential candidate conspiring to interfere in an election by paying hush money to a porn star and then falsifying business records to cover it up simply does not describe the commission of official presidential acts.  Moreover, although Trump complains about the admission at trial of evidence relating to events that happened in the White House (such as a conversation Trump had with an official adviser in 2018), this evidence was actually about non-presidential conduct, as I have explained elsewhere. Trump and his lawyers repeatedly commit the fallacy that any time he does something, that makes it official conduct. But that is not what the Supreme Court ruled, and in fact at the Manhattan trial prosecutors adeptly limited the questioning to unofficial conduct.  As Bragg’s office stated in responding to Trump’s request to delay his sentencing, it “is correct that the denial of immunity from prosecution is immediately appealable” — i.e., it would be appealable before trial. “But here, in contrast to defendant’s criminal case in D.C., the question of defendant’s immunity from prosecution is not presented.” That’s because the dispute ultimately concerns the admission of evidence about events during Trump’s presidency, and the DA’s office explained that the “Supreme Court’s recent decision did not consider whether a trial court’s ruling on that distinct evidentiary question is immediately appealable, and there are strong reasons why it should not be.” Criminal appeals are generally decided after defendants are sentenced. There is no reason here to divert from that well-established practice that ensures the prompt and orderly administration of justice. No other defendant would be allowed this pause. Neither should Trump be if we are to live up to the American principle that no one is above the law. Trump’s other arguments fare no better. He also says that the sentencing should be delayed until after the election to “prospectively mitigate the asserted conflicts and appearances of impropriety” that it alleges would infect any sentencing hearing held before the election. But the defense’s repeated claims that Merchan is biased have been consistently rejected by all authorities that have reviewed them, including the New York Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, which previously concluded that “the judge’s impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.” In fact, delaying the sentencing until after the election might serve to increase appearances of impropriety. For example, if Trump is elected and then not sentenced to a period of incarceration (although I have argued incarceration would be appropriate given his crimes), the public might think he unfairly received a lighter sentence because he was elected president.  Trump also asserts that the sentencing should be delayed until after the election because doing so would supposedly prevent prosecutors “from filing a sentencing submission,” which would argue what sentence Merchan should impose, before the judge rules on Trump’s motion to vacate his conviction. The defense contends that such a submission would be “personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the Presidency.” But any such submission would not be public. Besides, Trump should not receive preferential treatment merely because he is a presidential candidate. Many criminal defendants are sentenced every day while they might be applying for jobs, yet they are not permitted to postpone their sentencing hearings until after they have completed all rounds of their job interviews. That this applicant is seeking the presidency of the United States does not change a thing.  The purposes of sentencing, whether retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence or incapacitation, are all frustrated when that sentencing is delayed. Given that Trump was convicted of feloniously interfering in the 2016 presidential election and charged federally and in Georgia with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the court should specifically deter him from committing more election crimes in 2024 by handing down its sentence without additional delay, even if the imposition of that sentence is ultimately delayed pending his appeals. A sentence of incarceration, which I have argued is otherwise merited, could protect American voters from imminent election crimes. Moreover, the sentencing hearing is likely to provide valuable information about not only the crimes of which Trump was convicted but also other aspects of his background. It will also allow voters to learn what the judge who oversaw his trial thinks about the seriousness of his crimes. American voters deserve to have that information before they decide whether to vote for defendant Trump in November. Trump should be denied the special treatment he seeks to delay his sentence simply because he is a presidential candidate. To avoid undermining public faith in the rule of law and fairness of the criminal justice system, Trump’s sentencing should go ahead as scheduled."
47,"In effort to woo women voters, Trump employs blatant racism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 15:24:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-racism-truth-social-post-women-voters-rcna167264,"Here’s a quick follow-up of sorts to a post from last week, when I wrote about Donald Trump’s campaign relying on racist and xenophobic claims that resemble campaign materials from the early 20th century. Trump gave us another example Sunday, when he reshared a social media post with footage of dark-skinned people walking in line. The accompanying text said: “If you’re a woman you can either vote for Trump or wait until one of these monsters goes after you or your daughter.” Trump’s campaign is maniacally focused on anti-immigrant fearmongering, so, much like with that post, the message here seems clear enough, no? In essence: “Women, fear the dark-skinned people” — and not the old white men who want to wield control over your body (and your daughter’s) and keep you in abusive marriages. This was straight-up “Birth of a Nation”-style racism being promoted by the standard-bearer of the Republican Party. And though I don’t plan to report on every racist thing Trump does or says — in part because neither you nor I have the time — I do want to make three observations:"
48,Donald Trump says America is in decline.

On Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump once again called the United States a “nation in decline.”  For any Republicans out there who may want to follow down Trump’s trail, let me give you some facts: America is a great nation, and the overwhelming majority of Americans — the ones who will be voting for or against you this fall — agree with me. We have fed and freed more people through the years than any other country on the planet. We are economically stronger relative to the rest of the world. The Dow is higher than it’s ever been — far higher than when Trump was president. Trump loves to say, “Drill, baby, drill,” and although some Democrats may not like it, if you look at the U.S. and its oil production, we have produced more oil this past year than any other country in history.  We are also the strongest military power in the world. Even our enemies understand we’re not a nation in decline. Trump is always talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin and what a great leader he is. But the fact is, Texas has a higher GDP than the entirety of Russia. Culturally, there’s also America’s reach in soft power. Just look at Taylor Swift going through Europe and the economic boom that is for those countries. It’s exhausting to hear Trump and other Republicans say we’re a failing country. It’s not true. America is stronger than it’s ever been. I challenge Trump to find a measurement that would suggest we’re a nation in decline. It’s a strange form of patriotism to say that America is only great if one leader is in power, and that if that leader is not in power then America is in decline. But that’s what you have with their side."
49,Harris and Walz are hitting Trump where it hurts: his masculinity,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 11:17:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-rally-trump-masculinity-gender-attacks-rcna167214,"During a campaign stop in Rochester, Pennsylvania, over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris lobbed a volley in her war on Donald Trump’s hypermasculine ways, criticizing the “perversion” and “coward”-like behavior undergirding the bravado. It was a nice reversal of the usual gendered rhetoric. Trump’s attacks on Harris have dripped with misogyny and general creepiness since she emerged as the Democratic nominee. He’s repeatedly insulted her intelligence; lately, he’s resorted to commenting about her physical appearance as well. Meanwhile, the campaign and allies in conservative media have tried to broaden his appeal with male voters while deploying some rather juvenile tactics. But Trump’s increasingly hypermasculine persona — a toxic mixture of Al Bundy from ""Married ... With Children"" and Biff Tannen from “Back to the Future” — arguably gives Democrats an opening. Even when President Joe Biden was still running, Democrats made concerted efforts to attack Trump’s performative masculinity and bullying behavior to discourage men from following in his path. And the Harris-Walz ticket has afforded Democrats more opportunity to attack toxic MAGA masculinity, with an uncowed woman leading the ticket and her running mate offering a comparatively kinder, more compassionate depiction of masculinity than is being offered by Trump and his followers.  And Harris launched a pointed attack of her own on Sunday, contrasting how her campaign perceives strength with how … others … do.  She said:  Harris didn’t need to mention Trump by name for viewers to know who she was referencing. The sentiment here — that bullies are cowardly and weak at heart — aligns with comments Tim Walz made about the MAGA movement when he was being considered as Harris’ potential running mate. I’m on the record with my belief that these kinds of attacks on Trumpy hypermasculinity are likely to be valuable for Democrats. Trump and his movement portray strength as the key to manhood. And we know one of his key metrics for strength is one’s ability to vanquish or humiliate his political foes. The fact a campaign led by a Black woman is taking him to task for this “perverse” idea seems likely to goad him into more misogynistic outbursts, which don’t appear to be helping him.  And simultaneously, in attacking Trump’s bullying behavior, the Harris-Walz campaign can do lasting good by arguing — to all Americans, but certainly, the men who need it most — that true power is about aiding others, not trampling on them."
50,Manhattan prosecutors leave it to Judge Merchan whether to delay Trump’s sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 10:08:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-sentencing-bragg-letter-merchan-rcna167165,"Judge Juan Merchan has another tough decision to make in Donald Trump’s New York criminal case. After Trump’s lawyers last week pushed to delay sentencing in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office says it’s deferring to the judge about whether to do so. Merchan had set the former president’s sentencing for Sept. 18, two days after the judge is poised to rule on Trump’s motion to set aside his guilty verdicts based on the immunity ruling. In their letter last week, Trump’s lawyers said that if Merchan rejects their immunity-related motion, then they intend to immediately appeal, and they argued that it would be unfair to sentence their client in the meantime as he runs for president again. In their response made public Monday, Manhattan prosecutors disagreed with multiple points in the letter but ultimately deferred to Merchan on whether to keep the Sept. 18 sentencing. The state noted that, unlike Trump’s federal election interference case that led to the Supreme Court’s July 1 immunity ruling, the issue here isn’t whether the charged acts in the so-called hush money case are immune from prosecution; the issue in New York is whether any official-act evidence used to prove Trump’s guilt of unofficial conduct ran afoul of the high court ruling such that Trump’s guilty verdicts need to be overturned prior to sentencing. Trump was found guilty in May of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. “The Supreme Court’s recent decision did not consider whether a trial court’s ruling on that distinct evidentiary question is immediately appealable, and there are strong reasons why it should not be,” prosecutors wrote to Merchan in their letter dated Aug. 16. “Nonetheless, given the defense’s newly stated position, we defer to the Court on whether an adjournment is warranted to allow for orderly appellate litigation of that question, or to reduce the risk of a disruptive stay from an appellate court pending consideration of that question,” the prosecutors continued, adding that they’re prepared for sentencing whenever it takes place. Acknowledging the reality of the situation, prosecutors added in a footnote: So in addition to pointing out the “significant public safety and logistical steps by multiple agencies” needed to prepare for Trump’s court appearances, the prosecution’s letter suggests that keeping the Sept. 18 date could be all for naught, given Trump’s intention to immediately appeal the likely impending denial of his motion by Merchan. Of course, if Merchan sides with Trump on Sept. 16, then there won’t be a sentencing to contend with. “The defendant’s newly-stated position concerning an immediate appeal ... may mean that significant preparatory steps are taken, only to have such steps disturbed by appellate litigation,” prosecutors wrote, referring to a potential appeal of the motion on which Merchan is set to rule Sept. 16. The prosecution’s letter is the latest reminder of how broadly the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. United States can favor the GOP presidential nominee. While Trump has already benefited from that ruling, the full extent to which he does so remains to be seen in all of his criminal cases. In the meantime, Merchan has yet another difficult decision to make in this unique prosecution when it comes to this scheduling matter. The judge stressed to the parties earlier this month (before Trump’s letter last week) that the Sept. 18 date remained unchanged. The prosecution’s letter could complicate matters for the judge, but we’ll learn from Merchan himself in an order that could come anytime now.

51,Trump’s unsettling new question: ‘Why are we having an election?’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 10:03:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-unsettling-new-question-are-election-rcna167196,"By all appearances, Donald Trump really doesn’t like it when Democrats describe him as a threat to democracy, and yet, the Republican keeps saying things that reflect a degree of animosity toward the American system of government. Take the former president’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, for example. The New York Times reported: The context for these off-the-cuff comments was a bit of a mess. The GOP candidate, holding a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, was speaking about inflation when he apparently had a thought. “You know, they do polls on this stuff, and I’m at like 93%,” Trump said, referring to surveys that apparently exist in his imagination. “I said, ‘So why are we having an election? They didn’t have an election. Why are we having an election?’” And at that point, he moved on, lamenting the fact that President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Honestly, it’s not clear exactly what Trump was trying to say. Evidently, he’s still outraged that the Democratic Party didn’t go through a traditional nominating process before rallying behind Vice President Kamala Harris. The “they” in his quote, in other words, referred to his Democratic rivals. It was less obvious who Trump was referring to with “we.” To be sure, it was a rhetorical question, but “we” are having an election because that’s how we make decisions in the United States. It’s tempting to think Trump was complaining about the asymmetry — he had to go through GOP primaries and caucuses, nearly all of which he won with relative ease — but he was speaking entirely in the present tense. “Why are we having an election?” couldn’t refer to Republican nominating contests that wrapped up months ago. Charitable observers might be inclined to shrug this off, and as best as I can tell, the comments didn’t generate a lot of pickup over the weekend. But let’s not forget that Trump has spent recent weeks repeatedly saying that he and his political operation “don’t need” votes — a curious comment from a candidate for public office — which has dovetailed with his comments a few weeks ago that his Christian supporters “won’t have to vote anymore” if he wins a second term. Soon after, given a chance to walk that back, the GOP nominee instead doubled-down on the rhetoric. This is the same White House hopeful who’s raised the prospect of creating what he’s pitched as a temporary American “dictatorship,” refused to accept his electoral defeat four years ago, talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, and arguing that his rivals shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him. It’s against this backdrop that Trump asked his supporters, “Why are we having an election?” as if this were a legitimate question. It isn’t."
52,Why Trump is ignoring Republican calls to focus on policy and issues,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 07:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ignoring-republican-calls-focus-policy-issues-rcna167151,"The more Donald Trump targets Kamala Harris with personal attacks, the more Republican officials try to convince the former president to try a more substantive and constructive course. So far, he has ignored the suggestions. But those hoping to steer him in a smarter direction keep trying anyway. The New York Times reported: Around the same time, Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” and delivered a similar line. “President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America, and if you have a policy debate for president, he wins,” the South Carolina Republican told host Kristen Welker. “Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.” The intraparty pitch is entirely straightforward: Trump has a substantive advantage, the argument goes, so if he can show some message discipline and stick to policy, his candidacy will benefit accordingly. And why, pray tell, is the former president ignoring this advice? There are a few reasons, actually. Trump doesn’t care about governing. In fact, he never has. (I wrote a book about this four years ago, exploring the problem in more detail.) There’s a reason the GOP candidate delivered a speech on economic policy last week that largely ignored economy policy: This guy just isn’t interested in talking about substantive issues, no matter how many people urge him to care. Trump doesn’t know how to talk about policy. Even if Trump could be convinced to pretend to care about governing, he’d quickly run into a related problem, which is even more serious: He can’t fake it well. Indeed, one of his signature issues is trade tariffs, and whenever he tries to talk about them, the Republican reminds the public that he still doesn’t understand his own idea at the most basic level. Trump almost certainly knows his ideas are unpopular. The former president has some goals he’s interested in pursuing, but they’re not exactly the sort of things that win over swing voters. Among Trump’s priorities are tax breaks for the wealthy, pardons for politically aligned criminals, abortion restrictions, and the creation of a temporary American “dictatorship.” Even if one were inclined to put aside the radioactive unpopularity of the Project 2025 agenda — written in large part by members of Trump’s own team — the GOP nominee’s own stated ideas are political losers, too. As Dan Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts, summarized last week, “This explains why Republicans in general and Trump in particular have become so flummoxed. The larger Republican party is keenly aware that Trump’s personal attacks on Harris will not redound to the GOP’s benefit. But neither can they talk about their actual policy platform because most of it is hideously unpopular.” No wonder Republicans seem so anxious about the ticket’s messaging."
53,Trump taps two of his adult kids for presidential transition team,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 06:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-taps-two-adult-kids-presidential-transition-team-rcna167129,"When Donald Trump was president, he relied on his daughter and son-in-law in the West Wing. When Trump needed a new leadership team at the Republican National Committee, he rewarded his daughter-in-law with a top post. And when it came time for Trump to put together a post-election transition team, the former president once again kept matters within the family. The New Republic noted that the GOP candidate unveiled a five-member transition team — and two of his sons are on it. It’s worth emphasizing that in modern presidential elections, both major-party nominees choose transition teams long before Election Day so that they don’t have to start from scratch in November. This isn’t a situation in which members of Team Trump are simply assuming they’re going to win; Team Harris is making similar plans. Indeed, part of what makes these developments notable isn’t that they’re too early, but rather, that they’re surprisingly late. As a New York Times report explained, “As a matter of timing, it came months after a typical presidential campaign starts working on contingency planning to ensure a smooth transition should its candidate win the election.” In 2016, for example, Trump’s operation announced a transition team in May. This year, for reasons unknown, the Republican campaign waited until mid-August. What’s more, eight years ago, Team Trump focused on officials with governing experience to oversee the transition effort, tapping then-Gov. Chris Christie and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. In 2024, the transition team will feature McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive who led the Small Business Administration during Trump’s term; Lutnick, a wealthy donor; two of Trump’s sons; and the former president’s current running mate. But just as notable is the fact that the transition team is slated to play a prominent role in staffing the prospective administration, and as The New Republic’s report added, this is a subject of great interest to the former president’s oldest son. “I don’t want to pick a single person for a position of power. All I want to do is block the guys that would be a disaster,” Trump Jr. told Axios in July. “I want to block the liars. I want to block the guys that are, you know, pretending they’re with you.” The Times’ report added that Team Trump does not intend to use “the office space and computers that the federal government makes available for transitions,” and officials from the campaign would not explain why."
54,VFW slams Trump’s ‘asinine’ rhetoric about the Medal of Honor,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 05:44:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vfw-slams-trumps-asinine-rhetoric-medal-honor-rcna167119,"The Veterans of Foreign Wars has long positioned itself as a nonpartisan organization that has nothing to do with electoral politics. Plenty of groups run campaign ads, issue endorsements, and create super PACs, but the VFW isn’t one of them. With this in mind, it becomes all the more notable when the organization publicly criticizes a presidential candidate in an election year. In 2020, for example, an Iranian missile strike left several dozen U.S. troops with traumatic brain injuries. Trump dismissed the importance of the injuries — he called them little more than “headaches” — prompting the Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask him to apologize for minimizing what had happened to the troops. Trump ignored the request. Four years later, the GOP candidate insulted veterans again, prompting another VFW response. The New York Times reported: If you missed it, it was late last week when Trump spoke at an event on antisemitism at his Bedminster golf club and was introduced by Miriam Adelson, who plays a prominent role in GOP politics. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, the former president, unprompted, reflected on the fact that he gave Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, as part of an apparent gesture to thank the late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “That’s the highest award you can get as a civilian. It’s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version,” Trump said, referring to the Medal of Honor military award. “It’s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump added. “She gets it and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal, but she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she got it for — and that’s through committees and everything else.” These unscripted and wildly unnecessary comments are what prompted the angry response from the VFW, among many others. For his part, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley responded to the controversy by telling NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt, “Well, look, there is nobody who supports the military, our veterans’ communities, and all of the military families more than President Trump.” I won’t pretend to know whether the RNC chair genuinely believes what he said, but the fact of the matter is that pretty much everyone supports the military, our veterans’ communities, and all of the military families more than Trump. We are, after all, talking about a Republican who has disparaged wounded veterans, condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers” and “losers,” disparaged American servicemen and women who are captured during combat, feuded with Gold Star families, and downplayed the importance of troops with traumatic brain injuries. What’s more, as a candidate, Trump liked to say he “felt” like he had served in the military because his parents sent him to a military-themed boarding school as a teenager. He went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military,” which was a precursor to Trump pointing to bone spurs as part of an apparent effort to dodge the draft. In other words, it’s not as if this guy has a reservoir of credibility on veterans’ issues he can rely on after his latest nonsensical comments."
55,Latest 2024 polls lead Trump campaign to concoct weird theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-19 05:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/latest-2024-polls-lead-trump-campaign-concoct-weird-theories-rcna167113,"For much of the year, Donald Trump had reason to be pleased with national and battleground state polling. Four years ago, surveys showed the Republican struggling badly ahead of his eventual defeat. In 2024, however, the data showed the former president consistently ahead. That is, until it didn’t. After incumbent President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign and Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy gave Democrats a much-needed boost, public opinion research showed Trump’s advantage start to evaporate — both in head-to-head matchups and on key issues. The GOP candidate and his political operation haven’t exactly handled the shift in a healthy way. Two weeks ago, for example, Team Trump embraced a “skewed polls” message reminiscent of 2012. On his social media platform, the former president also tweaked his messaging, abandoning missives about polls, and instead touting what he described as “real” polls that told him what he wanted to hear. But it was his running mate, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who took matters in a deeply weird direction. HuffPost reported: “Consistently, what you’ve seen in 2016 and 2020 is that the media uses fake polls to drive down Republican turnout and to create dissension and conflict with Republican voters,” the senator said. Vance added, “If you talk to insiders in the Kamala Harris campaign, they are very worried about where they are.” For now, let’s not dwell on the dubious idea that Trump’s running mate has special insights into the perspectives of Harris campaign staffers — who probably aren’t sharing private thoughts with the far-right senator. Let’s instead consider just how bizarre Vance’s conspiracy theory is. To hear Vance tell it, major independent news organizations conspired — more than once — to release false polling data, as part of an elaborate plot to discourage Republican voters. As far as the Ohioan is concerned, this is grounds for skepticism about 2024 polling. In Grown-Up Land, of course, major independent news organizations have never conspired to distribute fraudulent survey data, and the fact that Vance peddled such a line to a national television audience is a reminder of just how ridiculous his messaging has become. I did, however, have a follow-up question for the senator: If media outlets release “fake” polling data to manipulate Republican voters, why did the polls show Trump ahead for months? From Vance’s perspective, did news organizations temporarily forget, only to suddenly remember the plot?"
56,JD Vance isn’t helping Trump’s ticket. Removing him would be even worse.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-18 09:21:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-isnt-helping-trumps-ticket-removing-even-worse-rcna167006,"Experts often debate about the best approach to vice presidential selection: Try to balance out the presidential candidate’s characteristics, experience, and regional background? Or focus on finding a credible governing partner? But there’s almost implicit agreement on one principle: The vice presidential candidate should not harm the ticket. And it seems a lot easier for a VP pick to bring liability — from lack of proper vetting for scandals to lack of preparation of serve as president or lackluster campaign skills — than to really help the ticket. So far, Donald Trump seems like he may have failed that test with the selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, whose ratings have reportedly officially dipped to the lowest for any running mate in modern history. Vance was the choice of a confident candidate, looking at strong re-election odds after President Joe Biden’s notoriously poor performance during the June 27 debate and some positive media coverage after a July 13 assassination attempt. The driving factors behind Vance’s selection seem to be his recently honed Trumpist credentials, especially his statement about how he would have acted differently from Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice president, on Jan. 6, 2021. But the race has changed since then. Biden is no longer at the top of the Democratic ticket, for one. And Vance looks especially troubling compared to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom more Americans view favorably than unfavorably. Vance hasn’t been able — or hasn’t appeared to try very hard — to distance himself from controversial past statements about gender, abortion and people without children. As a result, there’s been some speculation about Trump replacing him. It feels important to say that the odds of that happening are very slim. But if it were to happen, how would this work exactly? From the standpoint of the formal rules of the Republican Party, it’s fairly straightforward. The rules lay out a similar process for replacing the presidential and vice presidential candidates after the convention; the most likely process would be a special meeting of the standing party committee members. (This is what happened when George McGovern replaced Sen. Thomas Eagleton with Sargent Shriver in 1972.) More complicated is the issue of ballot access — some state deadlines have already passed, and early voting starts in just a few weeks in some states. These are practical issues, and could be resolvable with some effort. Nevertheless, it’s important to get the ballots right. Even though we learned in 2016 that voters really cast their ballots for their states’ slate of electors, the wrong candidate for vice president would be a bad look at best and a potential constitutional confrontation at worst. (If no vice presidential candidate wins a majority of electors, the Senate chooses the vice president.) The informal element of the process would be similar in some ways to replacing the top spot, yet different in crucial aspects. As with replacing the presidential candidate, there would be some serious party coordination needs. Parties, as my co-author William Adler and I find in our work on running mates, play a role in shaping VP choices. Nevertheless, the presidential candidate plays a huge role in narrowing down the selection and making the final choice. This leaves room for all kinds of possibilities as we speculate about what could happen next. Importantly, Trump (or someone) would need to convince Vance to step down before the formal efforts to replace him would even be a realistic possibility. Then comes the question of who would replace Vance on the ticket. Here’s where things get interesting, with possible party jockeying in public and behind the scenes, as well as possible tensions within the campaign and between campaign and party. Some might theorize that Trump should look to politicians from the crucial swing states where the campaign has lost ground — start thumbing through the roster of GOP politicians from Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, for example. He could go back to his original short list and select Doug Burgum or Marco Rubio, both who have sought the presidential nomination and been through some national vetting. He could emphasize bringing someone from an underrepresented group to the ticket — Nikki Haley, Tim Scott or Vivek Ramaswamy (or Rubio) come to mind as possibilities. Ramaswamy, whose energetic RNC speech addressed some of the party’s outreach problems to minority communities, might especially be seen as a natural replacement for Vance. He’s also young and a loyal, dedicated Trump acolyte. But he has never held political office. Or Trump might look at some of the women whose names were floated earlier this year — like Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., to try to match the energy among women in light of Harris’ historic candidacy. These are approaches that Trump could try, if he chose to go the risky route of replacing the vice presidential candidate — which, again, is quite unlikely. And that doesn’t mean that they would even work. Politicians who were passed over on the first round may not want to join a ticket that’s since suffered some setbacks, and no longer seems like such a safe bet for victory. A choice aimed at “targeting” women, Midwesterners or minority voters also might not work. Social science research suggests that these efforts rarely succeed. A main purpose of the vice presidential candidate, beyond avoiding harm or generating negative news cycles, is to highlight the presidential candidate’s judgment and values. Because Trump has already served as president, most people have already made up their minds about how they feel about these factors. Dumping Vance would almost certainly generate a news cycle that would be negative for the former president, casting doubt on his judgment and drawing further attention to his running mate’s missteps and flaws. It’s likely simply too late for Trump to pick someone else. And VP candidate replacements happen so rarely, and are so closely connected to campaign disasters like McGovern’s in 1972, that it would be hard to achieve the quiet, under-the-radar rollout that might have been the wiser strategy in the first place."
57,I’m a combat veteran. Here’s why Trump’s Arlington stunt was so insulting.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 15:11:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-arlington-national-cemetery-grave-photo-rcna168767,"Serving in a unit like the 101st Airborne Division can feel like a job. It’s a normal, everyday thing. Even in combat. It’s not until after you leave a famous unit like that — after you leave the Army, in fact — that you realize it is a privilege to lead and serve alongside such soldiers. It’s not until much later, among the regular people at the office, that you realize how unlikely it is that anyone around you would ever grab three guys and come running if you were pinned down or out of ammo. In the Army, you take those things for granted because everybody does it. They do it. They don’t question it. They don’t all survive. I survived and I’m old now. Not truly old. I’m 46. But old in the Army sense. I’m no longer carved out of wood. My left hamstring groans at the thought of running more than a mile. Doctors have taken an interest in my colon. But I realize this is a privilege. It’s a gift. Being old, I mean. Aging out. For once, I’m finally aware of the privilege in the moment. I am old. But I have friends who are still in their 20s. Friends who should be in their 40s. Some of them are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. That is what makes Arlington a special place. And for those of us who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, Section 60 — the burial site of hundreds of service members killed in those wars — is the inner sanctum. It is the most sacred plot among more than 600 hallowed acres. When I lived in Northern Virginia during Barack Obama’s administration, I avoided Section 60 studiously. It was too much, and still too close. There was always that looming sense that it could’ve been me. Maybe it should’ve been me. So I didn’t visit until I was about to move back to Dallas. An Army buddy told me I had to go before I left D.C. So I did. Finally. All of this is to say that, to combat veterans, Arlington National Cemetery has the same power that all holy places have. And that is why Donald Trump’s recent behavior is so repulsive. Trump was so eager to use Arlington’s Section 60 as a backdrop for a campaign event this week that he may have broken federal laws against politicizing the burial ground to do it. Trump’s staff also shoved aside a cemetery official trying to stop them. He even posed for a photograph over a U.S. Marine’s gravesite, grinning and giving a thumbs-up. The moment was jaw-droppingly crass and vulgar, as all of Trump’s are. It defiled sacred ground. But of course, Trump’s disregard for military tradition and his disdain for military service members is well documented. This incident was only the latest in a long line. Trump began his adult life dodging the draft for Vietnam. Someone else went in his place. Maybe that person survived. Or maybe they’re buried at Arlington with thousands of other Vietnam veterans. 'Whatever the outcome, the thought has never troubled Trump. He later told Howard Stern that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases was “my personal Vietnam.” When those comments resurfaced during his first run for president, his supporters shrugged them off. “It’s a joke!” they said. “He’s a showman!” If it had only ended there. In 2015, responding to criticism from Sen. John McCain, a former POW, Trump claimed, “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” However one feels about the Vietnam War, few Americans have given more for their country than John McCain. That didn’t matter to Trump. A year later, after Trump proposed the first version of his “Muslim ban,” the parents of Army officer Humayun Khan took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Khan is buried at Arlington, having been killed in Iraq in 2004. His parents gave an impassioned plea to voters, laying out how service members of all faiths had sacrificed their lives in America’s wars. They denounced Trump’s attempt to single out Muslims. He responded by spending days attacking the grieving Gold Star family. General Mark Milley told The Atlantic that when he invited a wounded, wheelchair-bound soldier to sing “God Bless America” at Milley’s welcoming ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, Trump admonished him. “Why do you bring people like that here?” Trump asked, according to Milley. “No one wants to see that, the wounded.” On a trip to France in 2018, Trump declined a scheduled visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where more than 2,200 U.S. service members are buried. “Why should I go to that cemetery?” he asked staff members. “It’s filled with losers.” This horrific statement was confirmed by Trump’s then-chief of staff, John Kelly, a former Marine general whose own son was killed in Afghanistan and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Kelly also confirmed that in another conversation on the same trip, Trump called the Marines who died at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. And just a few weeks ago, Trump told an audience that the Congressional Medal of Freedom he’d awarded to Republican donor Miriam Adelson was “much better” than the Medal of Honor. Trump said the civilian award was superior because Medal of Honor recipients are “either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets or they are dead.” These are not one-off statements by a rhetorically reckless buffoon. This man harbors deep resentment toward the military and those who’ve sacrificed in service. Even when he poses with a family — as he did at Arlington this week — he only does so to enhance his campaign or his political prospects. Trump’s use for the military and our dead extends only as far as it suits him. All Americans should keep this front of mind as we head into the fall. In particular, veterans should remember that Donald Trump’s behavior at Arlington National Cemetery this week epitomizes not only how he is a menace to the United States, but how he is an enemy of everything we fought for."
58,Donald Trump's disrespectful Arlington photo-op should not come as a shock,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 15:05:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-arlington-photo-military-jd-vance-rcna168853,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 28 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes."" If there’s one thing we know about Donald Trump, it’s that he’s going to be exactly who he is — all the time, every day, no matter what. Nothing ever really seems to stick to him politically. Trump was just indicted all over again by another federal grand jury and he’s celebrating an endorsement from a suspected whale decapitator, but there is a scandal that has the former president and his aides scrambling for cover. It has to do with a bizarre photo op he did on Monday at Arlington National Cemetery. Trump can be seen grinning and giving the camera a thumbs-up over the grave of a Marine killed in Afghanistan. That appearance was off-putting enough by itself. But then, NPR reported that Trump campaign staff at Arlington had gotten into an altercation with a worker at the cemetery over their filming among the graves of the dead. The Trump campaign’s top spokesperson downplayed the incident in a statement to NBC News: “For whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony.” But the worker had a good reason, Arlington National Cemetery suggested, telling NBC News that a report has been filed on the incident and adding in a statement: Trump’s co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, told NBC News that Trump went to the cemetery to honor Gold Star families not to film a political campaign ad and Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio tried to play it off, saying it wasn’t a political ad and there “just happened to be a camera there.” There just happened to be a camera? Trump went to a military cemetery to film a video reminding viewers of the U.S. deaths during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, blaming his successor for them without mentioning that Trump tied his successor’s hands by agreeing to a withdrawal timeline set by the Taliban. But that’s not a political ad, right? But Trump wasn’t the only politician capitalizing off of that Arlington visit. He was accompanied by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah. Cox used photos of the event to solicit donations in a campaign email — a violation of federal law and something the governor now acknowledges was a mistake. Trump’s team, however, isn’t admitting any mistakes. Instead, they’ve got Vance, the member of the Republican ticket with some military experience, responding on the campaign trail. Vance chastised the media for turning the altercation “into a national news story” and noted that Trump was invited by the family of the fallen marine: ""They wanted Donald Trump there, and thank God that we have a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them.” It’s true Trump was invited … but not by all the families of all the 400,000 veterans and dependents buried at Arlington — who didn’t and can’t consent to being used as props by a few other bereaved families. Beyond Vance disparaging someone who works at Arlington National Cemetery for enforcing the rules, is Trump really “a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them?” Donald “I don’t like losers, I like people that weren’t captured” Trump? The Donald Trump who spent much of his first presidential campaign attacking the parents of an American Army officer who died in Iraq in 2004? The Donald Trump who, as president, fumbled the name of a fallen soldier in a condolence call to his widow then bickered with her and knocked her in interviews?  The Donald Trump, who according to his chief of staff — a retired four-star Marine general — refused to pay his respects at a veterans cemetery in Europe, saying, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” And who, on that same trip, called the more than 1,800 Marines who died at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. Or was it the Donald Trump who reportedly hated being filmed or photographed with wounded veterans? At Army General Mark Milley’s welcoming ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 2019, the general had chosen a combat-wounded soldier, Luis Avila, to sing “God Bless America” at the ceremony. Milley claimed that afterward, the president told him, “Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.”  Less than two weeks ago, Trump used war-wearied American service members as a punchline to talk up one of his biggest political donors. Recalling the moment Miriam Adelson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Trump told the crowd: So you could be forgiven for looking at all of this and thinking that Trump only has respect for the most revered American institutions — the military, the justice system, the free elections — only when they’re working for him.

Kennedy Jr. says his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, is not on board with his support for Donald Trump. Speaking with TMZ, Kennedy said he had endorsed the former president against his wife’s wishes, calling it a “really difficult issue” for her. “This is the opposite of what she would want to do,” he said. “She went along with it because she loves me and she wanted to be supportive of me, but it was not something that she ever encouraged, I would say.” Kennedy said his wife had encouraged him — “out of compassion” — to accept an invitation to meet with Trump after the July assassination attempt. He said she then attended a meeting he had with Trump to make sure that no “hasty decisions” were made. “Her trepidation about this and discomfort with this ... were the dominant feelings,” said Kennedy, who suspended his independent bid for president last week after initially seeking the Democratic nomination. “She’s a lifelong Democrat and the idea of me supporting Donald Trump as president was just ... something that she would have never imagined, that she never wanted in her life.” Hines had released a statement on X after her husband left the race to thank those who worked on his campaign, but the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star made no mention of his support for Trump. Hines has had to distance herself from her husband’s political stances before, including when he brought up the Holocaust at an anti-vaccine rally. She also has faced criticism from her peers over Kennedy, with “The West Wing” star Bradley Whitford calling her out last week for staying silent about her husband’s support for Trump. Kennedy told TMZ that he “had to suppress some strong feelings” about Whitford’s comments, which he called “a template for bullying.” Hines’ disdain for Trump had been clear long before her husband dropped out of the race. Earlier this year, when a Variety reporter asked Kennedy whether he would accept an offer to be Trump’s running mate, he pointed at Hines and said: “I don’t think that my marriage would survive it.” Hines responded: “I think he’s right.”"
60,Vance: Harris can 'go to hell' for criticisms of Trump campaign over Arlington incident,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 10:18:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-kamala-harris-go-to-hell-trump-arlington-rcna168765,"Sen. JD Vance has defended the Trump campaign over an altercation with an Arlington National Cemetery staff member, instead criticizing Kamala Harris over the controversy and telling an audience she ""can go to hell."" In remarks at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Vance cited the deaths of 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, blaming the vice president for not having investigated the withdrawal or firing anyone. “Sometimes mistakes happen — that’s just the nature of government, the nature of military service. But to have those 13 Americans lose their lives and not fire a single person is disgraceful,” he said. “Kamala Harris is disgraceful.” “She wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up?” he added. “She can — she can go to hell.” Vance's comments are not just disrespectful — although they follow the example that Trump has maintained throughout his political career — they're also inaccurate. As The Washington Post pointed out, the criticism from the Harris' campaign spokesperson was merely to call the incident “pretty sad” but “not surprising coming from the Trump team” on CNN on Wednesday, and Harris herself has not said anything about it in public. Even as Vance has bristled at the criticism, accusing the Harris campaign of “trying to make a massive political issue” out of the incident and blaming the media for having “turned it into a national news story,” the Trump campaign's own indignant response to the incident has kept the story in the headlines. Rather than admitting it had defied federal laws that bar political activity at gravesites in Arlington, the campaign released a video that included the grave of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a combat veteran who died in 2020, without his family's permission. Marckesano's sister told The New York Times that the Trump campaign did not adhere to visitation rules, saying, ""We hope those visiting this sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected accordingly."" In addition to the scandal of politicking at the cemetery, a Trump aide pushed a cemetery employee out of the way so that the campaign could take photos and video, NBC News reported Wednesday, citing two Defense Department officials. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the employee a “liar” in response. What's more, Cheung and Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita have disparaged the employee in deeply personal terms, suggesting she had a “mental health episode.” The employee initially filed an incident report with military officials but later declined to press charges, fearing retaliation from Trump supporters, according to the Times."
61,Why Trump should avoid relitigating his infamous ‘dictator’ comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 08:20:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-avoid-relitigating-infamous-dictator-comments-rcna168798,"Donald Trump covered a fair amount of ground in his latest interview with Phil McGraw (better known as “Dr. Phil”), but one unexpected part of their conversation touched on notorious comments the former president made late last year, when the Republican candidate talked about becoming a “dictator.” A Fox News report summarized: “And I said ‘one day,’ because I wanna do the energy and I wanna strengthen the border, one day, and it was said with a chuckle, the audience laughed, I laughed, we all laughed,” he added. “But they take it and they cut it, and then they cut it, and it says ‘I wanna be a dictator.’ These are very dishonest people that we’re dealing with. Very dishonest people. Bad people.”When the television personality — the host, not the candidate — asked whether the comments had been taken out of context, the former president replied, “All you have to do is watch it.” If Trump wants to relitigate the controversy, that’s fine, but he might not like where this ends up. The controversy began in early December 2023, during an on-air interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The host, a close ally to the former president, prompted Trump to say he wouldn’t abuse his powers, but the GOP candidate replied, “Except for Day One.” When the host seemed surprised, Trump added, while pointing to Hannity, “He’s going crazy. Except for Day One.”Offered an opportunity to explain himself, Trump suggested that he’d use dictatorial powers to “close the border” and approve increased oil drilling. When Hannity again tried to help his pal, the GOP frontrunner doubled down. “I love this guy,” Trump said, referring to Hannity. “He says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said: ‘No, no, no — other than Day One.’ We’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.” As the video of the exchange makes clear, the context doesn’t much help. Republican officials insisted soon after that the former president was kidding. That defense proved unsustainable: In the weeks that followed, Trump repeated the line over and over and over again.In other words, this wasn’t just a single “joke” in a single interview; the GOP candidate, on multiple occasions, spoke publicly about his intention to serve as a temporary American dictator. I can appreciate why the former president, months later, wants to downplay the significance of his own rhetoric, but Trump said what he was quoted saying.

And based on some of the headlines alone, one could be forgiven for believing, at first glance, that Zuckerberg’s allegation of having been “repeatedly pressured” by the Biden administration to remove social media content that conservatives have obsessed over was, well, rooted in fact and principle rather than politics. That’s why I’ve appreciated the outlets that framed Zuckerberg’s letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan properly: as a rhetorical gift — or mere groveling — to Republicans at a key moment in a critical election. For context, Republicans have spent the past few years crowing about purported censorship and anti-conservative bias by the government and social media companies. And after all that time, including several House hearings and closed-door interviews, they’ve got nothing to show for it. In fact, all they’ve proved is that content moderation is a difficult task that is — and this is crucial — fundamentally left to social media companies to handle on their own. But Zuckerberg’s letter nonetheless aligned with conservatives’ claims. He showed contrition for not having been “more outspoken” about the “government pressure” he claims his companies faced from the White House in 2021 to remove certain content related to Covid-19, some of which he portrayed as “humor and satire.” But he then acknowledged that the decision about what content to allow was Meta’s, saying he feels strongly that his companies, including Facebook and Instagram, “should not compromise” their own standards. He also said that Meta shouldn’t have “demoted” a news story about the Biden family and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Republicans often point to this action as proof of anti-conservative bias, despite the fact that the guidance came from the Justice Department during the Trump administration — not exactly a bastion of liberalism. Zuckerberg also wrote that he won’t be making financial contributions toward boosting the country’s electoral infrastructure — as he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did in 2020 — in order to “be neutral.” Republicans have falsely said these grants unfairly aided Democrats, and Zuckerberg essentially cowed to them. But let’s keep it real: The Meta CEO has seemed far from “neutral” this election cycle. Zuckerberg has sucked up to Donald Trump, saying that seeing the former president “get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” He has made it harder to track the spread of misinformation on his platforms, and his company has also hired a former Project 2025 employee. Disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz wrote a great thread on X in which she made the case that Zuckerberg’s letter is all about self-preservation … and copying Elon Musk’s fealty to conservatives.

63,Trump’s online tantrum targets Harris with crude sexual remark,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 07:42:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-tantrum-kamala-harris-crude-sexual-remark-election-2024-rcna168793,"Even those who’ve grown accustomed to Donald Trump’s tantrums were taken aback by his latest online antics. An Associated Press report summarized: The former president’s timing could’ve been better. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released a new ad this week that argued, among other things, that Trump would seek revenge against his perceived foes in a prospective second term. It was against that backdrop that the Republican nominee used his social media platform to promote: But in case that wasn’t quite enough, a New York Times report highlighted what was arguably the most offensive item in the GOP candidate’s avalanche of ugly nonsense. The Times’ report added that the “repost was the second time in 10 days that the former president shared content from his personal account making sexually oriented attacks on Ms. Harris. Though he has a history of making crass insults about his opponents, the reposts signal Mr. Trump’s willingness to continue to shatter longstanding norms of political speech.” It’s worth emphasizing that in each of these instances, it wasn’t Trump who personally created the offensive online content. But that hardly makes the circumstances any better: The former president apparently saw these ugly messages and deemed them worthy of amplifying to his vast online audience. What’s more, his willingness to target Harris with a crude sexual remark dovetails with related rhetoric Fox News host Jesse Watters, who told viewers this week that the Democratic nominee, if elected, will “get paralyzed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her.” One of his co-hosts at the time, Jeanine Pirro, urged him to ""take it back."" (Watters denied that his remark was intended to suggest “anything of a sexual nature.”) Trump boasted this week that he’d be “great for women” if voters return him to the White House. There’s fresh evidence to the contrary."
64,Jim Jordan targets daughter of judge from Trump’s hush money case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 06:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jim-jordan-targets-daughter-judge-trumps-hush-money-case-rcna168760,"As Donald Trump’s recent criminal trial drew closer, the former president lashed out at a variety of people across the legal system, including likely witnesses in his hush-money-to-a-porn-star case. It led Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the proceedings, to impose a gag order on the Republican to help protect the integrity of the process. Trump, who has an affinity for going after the family members of his perceived foes, responded by going after the judge’s daughter — publicly and repeatedly. The GOP candidate’s allies, including House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Donald Trump Jr., soon followed down the same path. Four months later, the party is still at it. The Hill reported: As things stand, Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee’s far-right and conspiratorial chairman, wants the company’s CEO both to give a deposition and sign an affidavit that Authentic Campaigns was not in communication with Merchan. To be sure, to know the Ohio Republican is to know how irresponsible he is — I made the case last fall that Jordan is the single worst member of Congress — but even by his standards, these latest antics are tough to defend. The underlying conspiracy theory is that the judge in the Trump case might have somehow been in league with his daughter and her partisan campaign efforts. It’s a difficult idea to take seriously. As my MSNBC colleague Lisa Rubin explained, “The House Judiciary Committee has been told plainly that the digital strategy firm with which Judge Merchan’s daughter works has not done any work for the Biden or Harris campaigns this cycle and that she herself does not work with any relevant political clients. They’ve also been told about the death threats to her and the firm’s founder. Yet today, they subpoenaed the firm, as if it, as opposed to the committee or Trump himself, has engaged in misconduct.” What’s more, Authentic Campaigns’ founder, Mike Nellis, has explained to Jordan, in writing, “Authentic had no role, involvement, or influence whatsoever in those judicial proceedings,” Nellis wrote, claiming that his company has had no contracts with Biden for President, Harris for President or the Democratic National Committee since January 1, 2023. A report in The New Republic went on to note, “Nellis called Trump’s claims that Loren Merchan had raised tens of millions off of Trump’s trial ‘unequivocally false.’ He also lambasted the committee for ‘using valuable time and taxpayer dollars to perpetuate a false right-wing conspiracy theory,’ calling it a ‘disgraceful misuse of power.’” There’s no reason to believe this Republican crusade will end anytime soon, but it certainly should."
65,The Trump-Vance campaign is in (another) crisis of its own making,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 06:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/jd-vance-childless-women-teachers-insults-rcna168686,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 28 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is making headlines yet again after another one of his rants about childless women resurfaced. This time, Donald Trump’s running mate turned his ire to educators — attacking Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, during a Center for Christian Virtue leadership forum in 2021: Let me just say, as a person who has not birthed a child from my own womb, I take grave offense to these comments. I don’t know what children Vance himself has birthed — it’s my understanding that it was his wife who had the children — but it seems the senator just can’t help himself from opening his mouth and disparaging large swaths of the American public. Most Americans probably don’t agree with the idea that if you don’t have children, you don’t have a stake in this country’s future.  Obviously, this isn’t the first time Vance has attacked women without biological children and every time another one of these rants is unearthed, further damage is done to the Trump-Vance ticket.   This all goes back to the importance of vetting in a presidential campaign. I recently spoke to former Attorney General Eric Holder, who ran the vetting process for the Harris-Walz campaign. During that conversation, I asked him if he was sure his team got everything and that no stone was left unturned. Holder told me he combed through the internet and watched hours of videos of the top contenders.   So, I just have to wonder: What was the vetting process like for Vance? Because this is simply insane.

The former president, despite his awful record related to respecting U.S. troops and veterans, appeared eager on Monday to exploit the third anniversary of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghans. As a result, the Republican nominee attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was quickly followed by a thumbs-up photo-op at a gravestone in Section 60 of the cemetery, where many service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. At that point, the story was already problematic. On Tuesday, however, the matter took a turn for the worse amid reports of an “incident” involving Trump aides and someone who worked at the cemetery. A day later, the controversy continued to intensify. NBC News reported: Republicans might’ve hoped this scandal would be a one-day story. I have some bad news for them. It’s a story with a surprising number of moving parts, so let’s summarize where things stand. Where will the controversy go next? Watch this space."
67,RFK Jr. clearly has something Trump wants,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 14:29:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-seems-desperate-rfk-jrs-endorsement-harris-care-less-rcna166949,"I’ve long wondered what erstwhile Democrat Robert F Kennedy Jr. — now an independent — is after with his MAGA-friendly presidential campaign. I’ve thought: “Does he simply want to help Donald Trump win? Does he want to seek retribution, alongside his antivax buddies, against liberals for daring to try to prevent mass death during the Covid pandemic?” A new report from The Washington Post seems to have landed on a rather simple answer: power and ambition.  Apparently, Kennedy, through an intermediary, sought a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to see if she’d be willing to offer him a role in her potential administration in exchange for his endorsement.  The Harris campaign’s response? Essentially: “boy, bye.” Per the Post:  Kennedy said in response to the report that he had reached out to all the candidates, but never asked the Harris campaign for a Cabinet position. As the Post noted, the cold shoulder Kennedy reportedly received from the Harris campaign was markedly different from the response he received from Trump’s campaign regarding a similar offer. Weeks earlier, Kennedy and Trump spoke directly about the idea of Kennedy endorsing Trump in exchange for a Cabinet position or advisory role in a potential Trump White House. Portions of one of their discussions were even posted online. And though no agreement seems to have been reached, the fact the chats occurred at all highlights a pretty clear contrast. Team Trump seems thirsty for Kennedy’s endorsement, or for him to leave the race at least, and Team Harris doesn’t seem to care either way. Recent polling data show why that may be. As my colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, Harris’ entry into the presidential race has attracted independent and third party voters who’d been considering Kennedy when President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee. On the other hand, Kennedy’s ongoing presence in the race only seems to hurt Trump. So even if they were to meet, Harris could reasonably ask Kennedy: “Why do I need your endorsement when your ‘supporters’ are already flocking to me?” Trump seems acutely aware that Kennedy’s campaign, which has been imploding as of late, seems to be pulling from his support. That would explain his public attack on conspiratorial podcaster Joe Rogan after Rogan praised Kennedy’s campaign. I’d argue all of this puts Kennedy in a prime position to extract some kind of concession from Trump down the line. He clearly has something Trump wants, whether that’s a suspension of his campaign or a full-on endorsement. And Trump has shown shameless deference to people willing who aid his campaign in any way."

69,Leaked videos show how Trump’s allies plan to equate abortion with murder,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 13:58:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-training-videos-abortion-trump-rcna166924,"The more that Donald Trump and his campaign try to distance themselves from the authoritarian ambitions of Project 2025, the more revelations emerge about how tightly linked they are. Videos of the Project’s Presidential Administration Academy, recently obtained by the investigative reporting outlet ProPublica, provide even more damning evidence of how former Trump administration officials plan to carry out their agenda in a possible second term — and how abortion is one of their key targets. ProPublica published 14 previously secret videos produced by the Heritage Foundation to train future administration appointees. Two of these videos in particular show that despite Trump’s gaslighting of the public that he has “moderated” on abortion, his Project 2025 allies are plotting multiple ways to attack it. Project 2025 lays out multiple anti-abortion plans, including revoking Food and Drug Administration approval of the abortion medication mifepristone and using the Comstock Act as a means of instituting a national abortion ban by criminally prosecuting the sale of abortion pills through the mail. These videos show how Trump’s allies also plan to radically reshape the federal government to elevate anti-abortion activists and even equate abortion with murder. In the section “Coalition Building,” Paul Teller, a former special assistant to the president and a senior aide in the Office of the Vice President, and Sarah Makin, a former deputy assistant to the president and former director of outreach in the Office of the Vice President, discuss the importance of building relationships with outside advocacy groups to advance the administration’s agenda, particularly on “pro-life” issues. Makin highlighted her role in planning a Rose Garden event during which Trump addressed the annual March for Life remotely. For optimal “optics,” she reached out to “an umbrella organization for pregnancy centers” to arrange a group of people to stand behind Trump. She lauded that “we had moms and their babies, babies who’d been rescued from abortion by these pregnancy centers come and stand behind the president.” (The comments start around the 11:15 mark.) Pregnancy centers, sometimes called crisis pregnancy centers, are “facilities that represent themselves as legitimate reproductive health care clinics providing care for pregnant people but actually aim to dissuade people from accessing certain types of reproductive health care, including abortion care and even contraceptive options,” according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. They often use “false and misleading information, emotional manipulation, and delays.” In the segment titled “Left-Wing Code Words and Language,” Katie Sullivan, former acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, and Bethany Kozma, deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration, devoted more than 45 minutes to vilifying Democratic programs to combat climate change, promote equity and advance LGBTQ and reproductive rights as a diabolical leftist plot to control peoples’ lives, akin to rule under Stalin or Hitler. The pair discussed their experiences as “part of a coordinated effort in the Trump administration focused on trying to take back hijacked language and definitions across the United States government.” The left, Kozma claimed, “got very creative years ago and started using different words to make abortion sound a little less like murder,” using instead phrases like sexual and reproductive health or reproductive rights. Sullivan added, “it’s incredible how the left is able to make killing children and babies a ‘pro’ movement."" Sullivan promised the video would teach trainees “how to identify the left’s progressive language,” “how to scrutinize career staff compositions for dangerous language,” and “how to combat their manipulative efforts, ensuring clarity of definition and conservative intention.” Sullivan also said that “you can do this in any role at any level of seniority.” Although Trump pandered to the anti-abortion movement during his first term, and stacked the Supreme Court with the conservative majority that overturned Roe, it’s clear he is now terrified that the Dobbs decision is an albatross around his neck — and that all the attention on Project 2025 is a perpetual reminder of his allies’ radical goals. Last month, Trump clumsily tried to claim in a Truth Social post, “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it” and “I have nothing to do with them.” But Trump can’t beat the truth with misdirection. At least 140 Project 2025 contributors, including those featured in the training videos, previously worked in his administration. In 2022, Trump flew to a Heritage Foundation conference on the organization’s private plane, with the organization’s president, Kevin Roberts, to deliver a speech. In the speech, Trump said, “They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.” Rolling Stone reported that just before publishing his bogus denial on Truth Social, “Trump had been privately — and very bitterly — complaining about the abortion policies laid out in the lengthy Project 2025 manifesto, and trashing the Project 2025-linked ‘lunatics’ who keep demanding unpopular abortion bans and restrictions.” Trump is keenly aware of polling data showing that, as public awareness of Project 2025 has skyrocketed, voters have recoiled from it. Trump can try to run, but he can’t hide from his closest allies’ plans to turn America into a dystopia where abortion is criminalized, and his loyalists wield power to police and censor even any discussion of it at the highest levels of government."

On Thursday, Donald Trump held a news conference at his New Jersey golf club. The event was somewhat of a do-over for Trump's 90-minute rambling speech in North Carolina on Wednesday, where he was supposed to tout his economic proposals. The campaign did its best to set the scene — laying out a spread of groceries and posters claiming to show the “Price Increases since Kamala Harris took office.” That was the message Republicans and aides wanted Trump to stick to. Instead, what you saw was a man who is incapable and completely uninterested in staying on message.  It was Trump being Trump. It wasn’t as much a news conference as it was a rambling stream of grievances, insults, fabrications and gibberish. And that’s pretty much all we’ve gotten from Trump over the last few weeks. I don’t see any indication that’s going to change. The campaign is trying desperately to make him talk about the economy but Trump just can’t bring himself to do it. It's also worth noting that, for a guy who’s supposed to be a successful businessman, his ignorance of basic economics is kind of jaw-dropping. I’m interested to hear, whether on the record or off the record, the reaction from Republicans. I wonder if they saw that performance Thursday and thought: What are we going to do with this guy? Do we really want to put him back in the Oval Office? Where is he taking us?  Well, I think that’s pretty clear by now."
71,"To scare voters, Trump is making up claims about migrants finding jobs",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 11:33:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-immigration-rhetoric-crime-rcna166930,"Donald Trump held another meandering press event on Thursday, filled with all kinds of dubious claims.  One claim that's earned him particular criticism was his allegation that more than 100 percent of new job creation has gone to immigrants. That immigrants are purportedly siphoning jobs away from nonimmigrant Americans — which is demonstrably false, by the way — has become a common refrain in his 2024 campaign. The latest iteration was outlandish, even by his standards: Journalists have already debunked right-wing misinformation attributing job growth under the Biden administration entirely to immigrants getting jobs. Mathematically, though, Trump's statement is not even possible — another sign of Trump’s ongoing struggle with grade school-level concepts. And it’s also a sign of desperation. Trump launched his political career with a speech full of bigoted lies about immigrants — whom he painted broadly as rapists and ne’er-do-wells — being sent to the United States. I'd argue his racist and xenophobic portrayals of immigrants have gotten even more surreal since then, particularly in the current election cycle. This year, Trump has called migrants “animals” and “not people” in speeches, accusing them of ""poisoning the blood of our country.” In recent speeches, he’s routinely referred to serial killer Hannibal Lecter, attempting to associate the fictional character — who was held in a mental asylum — with immigrants who seek asylum in the U.S. So his made-up stat about immigrants somehow accounting for more than 100 percent of job growth is yet another tale he’s telling to sow fear and hate toward immigrants.  It’s noteworthy that Trump’s increasingly dehumanizing xenophobia comes as actual data about immigration and crime also shows him to be increasingly wrong. Border crossings decreased for the fifth consecutive month in July, reaching the lowest level recorded since fall of 2020, when Trump was president. In fact, the number of border crossings has been so low that NBC News reports Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has struggled to find enough immigrants to use in his cruel publicity stunt of busing asylum-seekers across the country. And violent crime, which Trump associates with immigration — despite data that shows immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born citizens — has declined at ""historic"" rates under the Biden-Harris administration.  This data exposes how Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric has been increasingly disconnected from reality of late. The facts simply aren’t on Trump’s side when it comes to the nightmarish scenes he paints for the public. To quote Trump-aligned rapper French Montana, “when the hate don’t work, they start telling lies.”"
72,Trump says civilian Medal of Freedom is 'much better' than Medal of Honor,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 09:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-service-members-military-medal-of-honor-rcna166891,"Donald Trump appeared to denigrate service members who were injured or killed in the line of duty once again, as he likened a civilian award to a “better” version of the Medal of Honor at a campaign event on Thursday. At an event on antisemitism at his Bedminster golf club, the former president and presidential candidate was introduced by Miriam Adelson, a powerful financial force in Republican politics and the widow of the late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. As he took the mic, the former president spoke highly of the couple and recalled awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, an act that sparked criticism at the time that Trump was rewarding a donor for their financial support. “That’s the highest award you can get as a civilian. It’s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version,” Trump said, referring to the Medal of Honor, a military award. “It’s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump said. “She gets it, and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal, but she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she got it for — and that’s through committees and everything else.” The GOP presidential nominee's off-the-cuff comments on Thursday follow a pattern of insulting veterans and service members, even as he claims to be a fierce supporter of the military. He has called military leaders “some of the dumbest people I’ve ever met in my life” and minimized potentially traumatic brain injuries among service members. In 2015, he infamously attacked Sen. John McCain for being detained in a North Vietnamese prison, saying he liked ""people who weren’t captured."" He also picked a personal fight with family members of a U.S. soldier who died while serving in Iraq. Trump has also long disputed a report from The Atlantic that he called service members who died in wars “losers” and “suckers,” though his former White House chief of staff John Kelly has confirmed some aspects of it."
73,Trump's immunity remark could be vindicated by the Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 08:31:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-new-york-sentencing-supreme-court-rcna166886,"Donald Trump kept the fact-checkers busy with his latest public remarks on Thursday. But one of his statements, regarding the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, is worth scrutinizing. Indeed, the statement may turn out to have some truth to it — not due to Trump’s honesty, but rather due to the vague and sweeping nature of the ruling itself. Standing outside of his New Jersey golf club, the GOP presidential nominee said, “As you know, the Supreme Court ruled recently on immunity, and I’m immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with.” Yes, the Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity recently (July 1, to be exact). So far, so good. But that he’s “immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with” is not what the court said in the federal election interference appeal. Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion said that there’s no immunity for unofficial acts, that there’s at least presumptive immunity for official acts, and that there’s absolute immunity for exercising the president’s “core constitutional powers.”   What does all that mean in practice? No one knows precisely, perhaps not even the Republican-appointed majority that laid out that new standard. The high court sent the case back to the trial court to figure it out “in the first instance.” So the extent that Trump’s immunity extends to the acts for which he's being prosecuted is yet to be determined. And whatever U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan decides in the first instance could wind up being vetted by the justices again before that trial can go forward. Of course, if Trump wins the election in November, then this may become legally moot, should he order the DOJ to withdraw his two federal criminal cases. (Special counsel Jack Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the federal classified documents case.) Both the timing and convoluted substance of the Supreme Court ruling, then, could amount to an effective grant of immunity to Trump if he’s able to crush his case before the Roberts Court even articulates more clearly the scope of that immunity. In fact, the ruling’s full effect isn’t even known in his New York criminal fraud case, where he wasn’t charged with official acts and was found guilty before the immunity ruling came out. The issue there stems from another odd feature of Roberts’ ruling, which curbs the use of official acts as evidence to prove guilt of unofficial acts — a point Trump’s lawyers have cited in an attempt to overturn his guilty verdicts prior to sentencing. Judge Juan Merchan in New York is set to rule on Trump’s immunity claim on Sept. 16 and sentence him on Sept. 18 if the immunity issue doesn’t stand in the way. But if Merchan rejects the immunity claim, Trump’s lawyers have signaled their intention to appeal immediately before any sentencing can happen — perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court. In all of Trump’s criminal cases, then, the extent of his immunity is a fact that only a Supreme Court majority can know.

74,Trump likes to act tough. Harris is proving her strength.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-tough-guy-act-crime-immigration-rcna166804,"Donald Trump is obsessed with toughness. He praises foreign despots for being strong, calls for police to be rough with suspects and uses blue-collar workers as props at his rallies. But Trump’s tough-guy persona is an act, and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is calling him out on it. Her campaign and its allies are leaning into Harris’ background as a prosecutor, her advocacy in the Senate and her time as vice president to tout her strength. And they’re contrasting this with Trump’s empty rhetoric and record of failure to show that she’s actually the stronger, tougher candidate. Nowhere is this fight more clear than on immigration. During a rambling and glitch-delayed conversation with billionaire Elon Musk this week, Trump leaned into his usual attacks, falsely accusing Harris of serving as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” For starters, that was never her title — and I should know, since I was working for her at the time. I served as Harris’ chief spokesperson when the president asked her to lead diplomatic efforts to tackle the “root causes” of migration. The vice president led these talks with our partners in Mexico and Central America, focusing on new strategies to expand economic opportunities in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. So, who is stronger: the candidate who complains about border crossings before, during and after his presidency or the one who looks to figure out why they’re happening and work with foreign leaders to address the issue? But her record goes even further back. In a Harris-Walz campaign ad titled “Tougher,” a narrator lists her record as a border-state prosecutor. Harris held drug cartels accountable and jailed transnational gang members. The campaign ad also highlights her support for a bipartisan deal deemed the “toughest border control bill in decades.” The ad ends by declaring: “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” Voters should know the truth: Trump’s weaknesses as a leader are part of the reason why Harris can play offense here. Trump sank a conservative-led border deal in hopes it would help him during the presidential election. He prioritizes fearmongering over welcoming tough solutions to fix our nation’s broken immigration system. Another major issue for the “toughness” question is crime, and again, Harris comes out on top. As the vice president has been saying on the campaign trail: As a former prosecutor, she knows Trump’s type. Her campaign has used that experience to frame her as tough on crime and highlight Trump’s own criminal record. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of an elaborate scheme to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. By contrast, Harris is a seasoned prosecutor who convinced juries to convict fraudsters. While Trump works to distort Harris’ record on crime, his supporters embrace his criminality. At his rallies, the MAGA faithful hold up signs with his mug shot with the words “Never Surrender.” Trump also vows to pardon criminals who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The so-called party of law and order wants these violent criminals to run free. Which of these two candidates is tough on crime? Candidates also prove their strength by how they choose to campaign. Sometimes it is about what you show voters, not what you tell them. Trump is holding fewer events this campaign, spending his time on late-night social media attacks and whining about how unfair everything is. Harris is vigorously barnstorming swing states and focusing on voters’ concerns. During her short time at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has managed to define herself before Trump and other Republicans have landed on an effective countermessage. This battle to control the narrative is playing out before one of Harris’ biggest opportunities to sell herself to the American people: next week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Democrats can use this moment in the spotlight to drill down on the stark differences between a Harris presidency and a second Trump term. It is also an opportunity to elevate Harris’ proven track record and counter Trump’s playbook of lies and half-truths. The next 80 days won’t be easy. But I’ve seen the vice president in action, and I believe she’s tough enough to handle them. She is meeting the moment and prepared for the task at hand. After all, running for president is tough — and so is Kamala Harris.

75,A secret video shows Project 2025 is still at the heart of a potential second Trump term,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-16 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-executive-orders-rcna166767,"In one of the least convincing performances this election season, former President Donald Trump has been trying to put daylight between himself and Project 2025, a 920-page manifesto for the next GOP president to follow. He has insisted that he has never heard of the head of the Heritage Foundation, which has spearheaded the conservative initiative. He not only has heard of him — he also flew on a private plane with him in 2022. Trump’s campaign has tried to divert the public’s focus to the much less detailed, but still extreme, official Republican Party platform, and Trump’s frustration with being linked with the retrograde policies was so great that the head of the project was forced to step down. His campaign then issued a statement welcoming what it called reports of the group’s “demise.” But one of the people who would almost certainly be tapped to implement Project 2025 should Trump win is apparently unconcerned. In a newly released video from a British journalism nonprofit organization, Russell Vought makes it clear that it’s full steam ahead. They’re stilling plan to make their dystopia vision for America a reality. Vought admitted as much in a conversation secretly recorded in a Washington hotel room last month. Unbeknownst to him, the two men he was meeting with were an undercover journalist and a paid actor from the United Kingdom’s Centre for Climate Reporting pretending to be relatives of a wealthy American donor. In the extremely candid chat that followed, as reported by CNN, Vought revealed just how much Project 2025 legwork has already been done: What a perfect summary of the danger of Project 2025 and why the prospect of a second Trump administration shouldn’t be taken lightly. For months after Trump’s January 2017 inauguration, there was absolute chaos as his inexperienced staff struggled to work the levers of power. The executive order to put his promised “Muslim travel ban” into effect was quickly enjoined in federal court, prompting numerous rewrites to pass legal muster. It took three tries before the Supreme Court allowed a much-revised version to be put into place in 2018. Vought’s claim that he and his team are drafting policy documents now speaks volumes about how different January 2025 could be. Vought’s is a name that longtime readers will recognize. He served in the Trump administration, rising to become the head of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Since then, he and other MAGA B-listers have joined forces at the Center for Renewing America, feeding Republicans in Congress some of their most unpopular ideas and least effective strategies. As such, Vought has been a rising figure among what can be generously described as the Trumpist intelligentsia. Accordingly, Vought was tapped to write Project 2025’s chapter on transforming the Executive Office of the Presidency, which laid out his vision for consolidating power in political appointees and away from career officials. He was also the policy chief for the Republican National Committee’s platform committee, further enmeshing himself and his ideas in the fabric of the GOP’s ideology. Even more concerning is that Vought intends to keep his group’s efforts hidden from view until after the election. Another CCR journalist spoke with Micah Meadowcroft, the Center for Renewing America’s research director, who bragged about the clandestine methods being used to get the drafts into the Trump team’s hands: This “second phase” of Project 2025 is what takes the document from being a set of wonky recommendations to an actual blueprint for what the next four years could look like. It’s how Trump triggers the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. It’s how he transforms the Justice Department into his own personal weapon for revenge. And it’s how the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court is given the cover to say it was all done legally. It’s also why Trump is so eager to distance himself from the initiative, as the document’s drafters and overseers readily admit. If enough voters look closely enough at what he intends to do, then there’s a chance for opposition to those actions to take root. We’ve already seen Trump scramble since Democrats began hammering Project 2025 into the public consciousness. It’s ironic that so many Republicans are now trying to say that the only way for Trump to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris is through a focus on policy over personal attacks. If that were the case, then we’d see them embracing and promoting Project 2025 and Vought’s work. Instead, they realize that remaining secretive gives them their best chance at executing their extreme ideas."
76,Donald Trump was right: The economy does do better under Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 14:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-donald-trump-economy-inflation-rcna166795,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 14 episode of ""The ReidOut."" In a 2004 interview with CNN, Donald Trump said, “The economy does better under the Democrats.”  The 2024 Republican nominee for president wasn’t wrong. And now, we have even more evidence to back up his point.  On Wednesday, we learned that inflation fell to its lowest level in more than three years. That’s not just good news for your pocketbook, it’s really good news for the Federal Reserve, which has been looking for numbers like this to justify cutting interest rates. Do you know what else we found out this week? Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has produced the most oil ever by any nation on Earth. This news is such a big deal that it seemed to trigger Trump. Late Wednesday, Trump held a “messaging event” on the economy in North Carolina.  He was supposed to lay out his economic vision for the future. Instead, he went on for more than an hour with incoherent lies about the currently booming economy and lies about the economy he left for President Joe Biden. Trump said he gave “Harris and Biden an economic miracle” that they turned into “an economic nightmare.” He then made vague promises about lowering inflation … without saying how he’d do that. “My first day back I will sign an executive order directing every Cabinet secretary and agency head to use every tool and authority to defeat inflation,” Trump said.  Then he just wouldn’t stop whining about how Harris supposedly copies him. “When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan it’ll probably be a copy of mine because basically that’s what she does,” Trump said. Trump’s rambling “messaging event” was totally disconnected from reality. Inflation is down, wage growth is outpacing price growth, and violent crime is also down. These are objective facts that don’t care about Trump’s feelings. Vice President Kamala Harris will also be in North Carolina on Friday to lay out her vision for the economy. According to Axios, she’s going to outline how she would lower costs for health care, housing and food for the middle class.  She reportedly wants to break with Bidenomics and hit rising prices head-on, making middle-class economic concerns a key focus of her campaign. Harris was boosted by a Financial Times poll that showed voters trust her more than Trump on the economy. Like Trump said in 2004, maybe voters are realizing that the economy just does better under Democrats.

77,Down-ballot Republicans will suffer under Donald Trump — and it's their own fault,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 14:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-down-ballot-republicans-agenda-rcna166786,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 14 episode of ""The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle."" Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, down-ballot Republicans appear to be getting nervous. Republicans are desperately trying to get former President Donald Trump to stay on message and focus on substance instead of attacking Harris for her crowd size and racial identity.  The last time I was a down-ballot Republican, I was on the ballot with Trump in 2016. So let me tell you how hard this upcoming election will be for them. The real problem here is, it’s not just that Trump is completely incapable of articulating an agenda — down-ballot Republicans really don’t have an agenda either.  This is a cycle where House Republicans have nothing to take to the American people on virtually every piece of legislation of national consequence. From raising the debt ceiling to keeping the government open to funding forces trying to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s march across Europe — it was Democrats, not Republicans, who actually led the governing coalition in Washington.  So as much as these down-ballot Republicans are rightly suffering under Trump’s listless campaign — truly one of the worst presidential campaigns we’ve seen in modern history — most Republicans have nobody to blame but themselves because they don’t have a discernible agenda either."
78,Donald Trump is teetering on the edge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 13:54:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-losing-control-kamala-harris-rcna166730,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 15 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio versus Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is literally the campaign of yesterday versus tomorrow. On Wednesday, we saw Trump deliver what was supposed to be a speech about the economy. Instead, he stood there and claimed the United States was a Third World country. I don’t know anyone who believes that.  Trump’s co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, are extremely good at what they do. But that skill doesn’t matter when it seems they have lost control of their candidate.  Trump has a tired, 20-year-old act. He updates it with some new figures from the past two or three years, but, at its core, it’s the same: The election was stolen. We’re a Third World country. Crime is up. Immigrants are going to attack your children — all sorts of fear factors.  And a lot of that act comes with huge, ugly racial overtones — especially in regard to the vice president. It makes you wonder: How long will it be before he really gets out of control? I think that’s going to happen at the debate. He’ll be in the ring with Harris, the vice president of the United States, a very sophisticated, very intelligent woman, and she will hammer him like a prosecutor. She won’t let him off the hook. In that moment, something may snap in him. And that’ll be it."
79,Trump flunks basic science yet again in speech insulting Harris' intelligence,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 12:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-north-carolina-speech-smart-rcna166779,"Donald Trump promised an “intellectual” speech during his campaign stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. True to form, Trump broke his vow. Instead, what rallygoers got were some mind-numbingly misinformed ramblings from a septuagenarian nominee. Over the last several weeks, Trump has lobbed all kinds of puerile insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, attempting to undermine her intelligence. During this very speech, which Trump claimed would focus on the economy, Trump claimed Harris is “not smart.” But it's hard to take such insults seriously when Trump himself fails to grasp some fairly basic concepts involving science and economics. For example, he went on a rant arguing that Harris wants to “abolish oil, coal and natural gas,” and he suggested people who use wind power can't use their electronics when it’s not windy. In reality, the vice president is currently serving in an administration that has overseen a record boom in domestic oil production. And wind turbines are capable of storing power, so people who rely on them do not need to experience some ""Wizard of Oz""-level wind storm to use their appliances and gadgets. But this is not the scenario Trump envisioned in his speech: Trump has long demonstrated his ignorance of and aversion to wind power and other climate-conscious policies. During another rant against wind power back in 2019, Trump admitted he “never understood wind.” Evidently, he still doesn’t. That this confusion comes from a man who’s called climate change a “hoax” and repeatedly claimed that the primary consequence of rising sea levels will be more beachfront property doesn’t inspire confidence in his capacity to confront the issues of climate change or encourage an expansion of renewable energy.  Trump also admitted on Wednesday that he doesn't know what “net zero” means, referring to “Kamala’s extreme high-cost energy policy known as net zero.” But then he took it further: In reality, many people — all over the world — are familiar with the term (but if you're not, “net zero” refers to the point at which the amount of greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount being removed from the atmosphere). In fact, there are even quick, eye-catching videos online that explain the concept in simple terms for people like Trump who don’t know what it means. So much for science. On the economics front, Trump demonstrated his grasp of the subject by holding up a large package of Tic Tac mints next to a smaller one and saying, “This is inflation.” He didn’t elaborate. He went on to talk about how inflation, which has actually been slowing as of late, is destroying our country. How the existence of different size packages of mints connects to inflation was left for the audience to guess at.  Trump is the leader of an entire political party, with staff and advisers who could help fill in the gaps in his knowledge, to educate him and his followers. But Trump seems perfectly content to wallow in ignorance — and to pull the MAGA faithful into the misinformed muck with him."
80,Harris — like Trump — wants to stop taxing tips. That’s a bad idea.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 12:09:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-economic-plan-leave-one-ill-advised-strategy-rcna166782,"In the three weeks (yes, it has only been that long) since she became a candidate for the White House, Kamala Harris’ campaign has proven remarkably skilled and successful. Which is why it was strange to see Harris make what might have been the first major mistake of her campaign: Adopting one of Donald Trump’s new policy positions, ending federal taxation of income from tips.  Like many tax proposals, ending taxation on tips has an intuitive appeal — until you consider its true implications. So the Harris campaign made a misstep in two ways: Appearing to parrot Trump, and doing so in the service of a bad idea.  The proposal has all the earmarks of something Trump heard somewhere, tested out before a crowd, and when it got a round of applause, decided it would become an official position of his candidacy. It’s unlikely he put more than a few moments of thought into it, let alone considered all the pros and cons. But there is a version of it in Congress, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. One of its biggest problems is that it doesn’t contain safeguards preventing the wealthy from shifting their income into something they’ll call “tips,” thereby enabling them to avoid paying taxes.  The Harris campaign says her proposal — which, like Trump’s, hasn’t yet been laid out in detail — “comes with an income limit and with strict requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of the policy.” It would apply only to service workers in industries such as retail and hotels. Which is why both candidates have promoted the idea in Nevada, a swing state where a large number of workers are employed in the hospitality industry.  Nevertheless, Trump’s promise didn’t exactly transform the race; the powerful Culinary Workers Union in Nevada, which along with its parent union UNITE HERE has endorsed Harris, wasn’t impressed by his proposal. “Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” one top official said.  As tax proposals go, this one is limited in its effects: An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows that of the approximately 4 million Americans who rely on tips, more than a third already make too little to owe any federal income taxes. But if Harris really wants to start a salutary discussion about tipping, she could propose eliminating the practice entirely, or at least scaling it back. We’ve all noticed how tipping has spread like wildfire; it seems like almost every purchase you make is now accompanied by a request for a tip, even when you received nothing resembling “service” at all. More importantly, tipping is a practice that has deeply racist roots; as an Economic Policy Institute report notes, “Following the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, formerly enslaved Black workers were often relegated to service jobs (e.g., food service workers and railroad porters). However, instead of paying Black workers any wage at all, employers suggested that guests offer Black workers a small tip for their services.”  Today, while the minimum wage hasn’t been raised from $7.25 an hour in 15 years, employers are allowed to pay tipped workers a minimum of just $2.13 — and that latter figure has remained the same for 33 years. The law says that if their tips don’t bring their total income up to $7.25, then employers are supposed to pay them the difference, but they don’t always do so, one of many forms wage theft takes. That’s just one kind of exploitation tipped workers are subjected to; millions of female servers have to grin and bear constant sexual harassment from customers, because their income is dependent on not angering the guy who just made an offensive remark or put his hands on their body. One survey found 70% of female servers saying they had experienced sexual harassment.  But if tipping is going to be with us at least for now, wouldn’t exempting tips from taxes still give a hand to low-wage workers? Perhaps some, but it would come with unintended consequences. For instance, lower income subjected to taxes today would mean lower benefits for those workers when they retire. As Berkeley economist Sylvia Allegretto notes, “Tips that are not taxed will not be credited towards the time and amount that workers are putting towards their Social Security.” So they would end up gaining very little if anything out of the deal. Lowering taxed income would also reduce the amount some workers would receive through the Earned Income Tax Credit.  There’s also a fundamental principle guiding proposals like this one that progressives should push against at every opportunity: that some kinds of income deserve to be treated better by the tax system than other kinds. Why should a person earning $25,000 a year in tips waiting tables at a diner not pay taxes, while a person earning the same $25,000 at a fast-food restaurant next door should? “As a general rule, you want to treat all income the same,” says Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “You don’t want to give people an incentive to game the tax code. This is one reason (in addition to giving a lot of money to rich people) that most on the left hate the carried interest deduction. We allow some of the richest people in the country to have much or most of their wage income to be taxed at the capital gains rate.” Just as we shouldn’t tax investment income at a lower rate than the income people get from working, it violates progressives’ belief in equality to say certain kinds of work should be exempt from taxes while other kinds shouldn’t.  Vice President Harris will be releasing her economic plan soon, and we should hope that it contains proposals that will make a difference to more Americans. Those could include increasing both the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage (or better yet, eliminating the distinction entirely), restoring the increased Child Tax Credit that was in place during the pandemic, and strengthening the ability of workers to form unions. All that would be much more meaningful than a proposal that amounts to little more than a gimmick. After all, if Trump thinks it’s a good idea, we should all be suspicious."
81,"Donald Trump seeks to delay New York sentencing, citing immunity ruling",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 09:30:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-ny-hush-money-sentencing-delay-rcna166750,"In their latest delay bid, Donald Trump’s lawyers want Judge Juan Merchan to push the former president's New York sentencing to some time after the presidential election. Among the reasons they cite in a letter dated Wednesday is the Supreme Court’s ruling that granted at least some presidential immunity in criminal cases. It seems unlikely that Merchan, who just rejected Trump’s latest request for the judge to recuse himself, will agree to another adjournment. The immunity ruling already led the judge to push Trump’s sentencing from July to Sept. 18. Merchan is set to rule on Sept. 16 on Trump’s motion to set aside his guilty verdicts (rendered in May, prior to the July 1 immunity decision) on the grounds that they run afoul of the Supreme Court’s new immunity rule. If Merchan rejects Trump’s motion, then that would clear the way for sentencing two days later. But if Merchan rules against Trump’s immunity claim, then the Republican presidential candidate’s lawyers have signaled that they want to appeal such an adverse decision before Trump is sentenced. “A single business day is an unreasonably short period of time for President Trump to seek to vindicate these rights, if he must,” they write. They argue that an adjournment is necessary “to allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling.” The letter notes that the immunity ruling, which arose in the federal election interference case, happened in a pre-trial posture and that the Supreme Court said that immunity issues are appealable pre-trial. “It follows that any denial of the pending motion is immediately appealable in a similar procedural posture,” Trump’s lawyers write. However, the New York case is different because Trump was already found guilty before the Supreme Court made its decision on immunity. So this case is in a post-trial posture, not pre-trial. Nonetheless, his lawyers argue in their letter that until the prosecution’s “immunity violations are addressed fully and finally, this Court may not ‘adjudicate’ the matter — including at sentencing.” Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove also write that an adjournment is necessary to prevent prosecutors from filing their sentencing position to the court while the immunity issue is pending. They argue that prosecutors “should not be permitted to file a public sentencing submission that will include what the Supreme Court described as the ‘threat of punishment,’ in a manner that is personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the Presidency as a result of the type of ‘peculiar public opprobrium’ associated with these proceedings that troubled the Trump Court.” Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

82,This Trump campaign post revives a racist American tradition,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-15 03:03:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-war-room-tweet-racist-rcna166639,"In an effort to boost its election hopes, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is drawing on the U.S.’s disturbing history of explicitly racist and xenophobic imagery.  On Tuesday, the ""Trump War Room"" account on X, which is run by the campaign, shared an unabashedly racist image that suggested if Kamala Harris is elected president, American neighborhoods will be overrun with hordes of Black people and immigrants.  “Import the third world/become the third world,” the post read, contrasting an image of a serene suburban neighborhood (in which no people are visible) with a photo depicting a huddled mass of mostly Black men crowded together on a city sidewalk. The essence of this post — that Black people, perhaps Black immigrants in particular, ought to be feared and rejected — is so grotesque and old-timey in its racism that it harks back to an era when such imagery was commonplace in mainstream American politics: the Jim Crow era.  In fact, whether it’s this post, the signs at Trump rallies (and the national convention!) calling for “Mass Deportation Now” or cartoons shared by Trump and his followers that depict Black people with darkened skin and nonhuman features, the Trump campaign is reviving the ugly American tradition of deploying unmistakably racist and xenophobic imagery as part of its political vocabulary — the type of stuff one might expect to see in the Ku Klux Klan’s Fiery Cross newspaper more than a half-century ago.  Here, for example, is a cartoon published in the Fiery Cross that depicted immigrants as “trash” and “undesirables.” That’s not so dissimilar to the message sent by the Trump campaign’s “third world” post or Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants’ being “vermin.” And here’s another cartoon published in that same newspaper, depicting Uncle Sam slamming the door shut on immigrants. “Whose country is this anyway?” the caption reads. The KKK's motto at the time it was sharing these images was literally ""America First,"" a phrase Trump and his followers have adopted as their own and used throughout his political career. Another ad from the pro-segregation Mothers’ League of Central High School in the 1950s called on voters to reject the historic push to desegregate the school in Little Rock, Arkansas, and support segregationists. “If the integrationists win this school board fight, the schools will be integrated this fall. There will be absolutely nothing you or we can do to stop it,” the flier warns. “DO YOU WANT NEGROES IN OUR SCHOOLS?”  The Trump War Room post on Tuesday is stoking those same bigoted fears about changing neighborhoods, fears that have never truly gone away, with imagery and rhetoric that are just as blatant as they were a hundred years ago."
83,Republicans are stuck with Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-14 14:47:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republicans-stuck-donald-trump-democrats-rcna166597,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" The Republican Party is stuck with Donald Trump. Now, they won’t say that publicly and they didn’t feel that way three weeks ago when many Republicans were talking about winning New Jersey and thinking about what jobs they would have in the second Trump administration. But a lot has changed since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the Democratic side of the ticket. Trump is now losing a race that he was clearly winning before.  Let’s not overstate things. Trump is behind in the national polling lead and he’s behind in the key swing states but all of the leads are narrow. The race is still — because of the nature of American politics — close. As we have just seen in the last three weeks, things can change radically very quickly.            One of the themes of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s short-lived presidential campaign still rings prescient. Haley frequently said that most Americans did not want a Trump-Biden rematch. She even predicted, “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.” Remember that line? There was some real insight there. And it’s transferred to what you see in the polls. Trump is now the oldest man to run for a four-year term as president. He’s older today than Ronald Reagan was when he left office. And Trump has been doing the exact same shtick since 2015. He is very obviously deteriorating in terms of his capacity and his energy — as we saw in his glitchy, rambling, difficult-to-understand audio conversation with Elon Musk on Monday. During that conversation, Trump delivered important public policy messages to the American people like: That appearance was the culmination of a three-week stretch in which Trump still attacked Biden, who, remember, is no longer running against him. He spread downright ludicrous and comical conspiracy theories falsely claiming the Harris campaign faked the size of its crowds with artificial intelligence. He suggested she only became a Black person recently, which is a racist lie, but also a weird product of a brain that’s been scrambled like eggs. Trump is the same guy he’s always been. Yet, Republicans still think he’s capable of being someone else entirely. I have, personally, covered seemingly hundreds of “new tone for Donald Trump” news cycles over all those years. Most recently, we heard it after he survived a genuinely terrifying assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. In the lead-up to the Republican National Convention, we heard that he’d changed. He’d mellowed. He was all about unity. As one convention delegate told reporters, “The real estate salesman, I think, is a different person. ... It’s a good thing. Humility goes a long way in politics and it attracts far more people ... I think he’s seeing God.” Sound familiar? Haven’t we been hearing this stuff for the better part of a decade? Like when CNN’s Van Jones praised Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, claiming he “became president of the United States in that moment, period.” Seven years. We’ve been doing this for seven years. At this point, it’s like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  And yet, if you listen to what Republican insiders are still telling reporters, they want Trump to do a pivot. They want him to be more disciplined. They want him to be more presidential. And this time, it will be for real.  This week, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Trump should stop questioning the size of Harris’ crowds at rallies and focus on the issues.  Fox Business host Larry Kudlow and former Trump aide turned Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway shared a similar sentiment, practically begging the former president to stay on message. And former Vice President Mike Pence had to remind his party that they can win “at every level by speaking the truth to [voters] respectfully.” “I have some familiarity with that; I did it for four years,” Pence said. The former vice president was threatened with hanging for it, but yes, he kept it respectful. Pence of all people should know you can’t change Trump. Yet people keep falling into the same old trap.  Even the people who joined the Trump 2024 bandwagon at its peak right after the convention. Some of those supporters showed up to a Trump fundraiser earlier this month on Long Island, including billionaire hedge funders like Bill Ackman. According to The New York Times, at the dinner that evening: I’ll say this for Trump: He has more awareness about himself than a shocking number of people in Republican politics. He won’t change.  Do you know who else understands this? Voters. Like the ones in a focus group held after Trump’s first joint address to Congress and the nation as president in 2017. The one that pundits like Jones called so “presidential.” One voter told CBS News, “That is no way the real Donald Trump. The real Donald Trump will surface in probably less than two hours.” Another said the next thing Trump needed to do was “delete his Twitter feed.”  When asked if they did not like the way Trump behaved on Twitter, almost the entire room raised their hands.  In advance of Monday's Twitter show with Musk, Trump got back to posting on the site. You know, the platform he was kicked off of for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. Meanwhile, the Democrats have something new — an open horizon in front of them as they enter a convention united, with a popular energetic ticket and a messaging opportunity that we have not seen in our lifetimes.

Tim Walz, held his first solo campaign event since joining the Democratic ticket. Walz addressed one of the country’s largest public sector unions, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  For years now, unions have been big fans of Walz. As governor of Minnesota, he banned noncompete agreements and guaranteed paid sick days for workers. He made it so companies can’t force workers to attend meetings where they argue against unionizing. The guy has even joined picket lines. The reason I bring all of this up is because it stands in sharp contrast to how the other side of this race thinks about labor.  On Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sat for a livestreamed interview with the billionaire owner of Tesla and the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk. In the past few years alone, Musk has fired nearly 80% of Twitter’s workforce. He’s also been found liable in court for illegally firing a Tesla worker who was trying to form a union.  During his conversation with Musk, Trump offered his take on those job cuts, calling Musk “the greatest cutter.” “I mean, I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t mention the name of the company — but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK, you’re all gone.’” On Tuesday, the United Auto Workers union filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk for that statement. The group’s president put out a statement that said, bluntly, “When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean.” The United Auto Workers has already endorsed Harris. With their backing — and the backing of other labor organizations like the UAW — the Harris-Walz campaign may just be able to buttress the ""blue wall"" and win in November.

85,The familiar trap Kamala Harris needs to avoid to defeat Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-14 12:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-avoid-democrats-trap-donald-trump-rcna166590,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 13 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" No one should confuse the enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for a lack of substance.  Harris knows her stuff. She knows where this country needs to go. I’m sure her campaign will lay out detailed policy positions very soon. Those policies will be posted to her website, for the American people to research and think about for themselves.  But Harris needs to be careful here. As a former Democratic senator, I know all too well the trap members of my party sometimes fall into. Democrats think, well, if I can just give one more detail about how we’re going to convert green energy into jobs or if I could just give the voters one more in-the-weeds factoid then that will do it. However, that approach will not appeal to the people who will decide who takes the White House. These people are not high-information voters. Many of the voters who will actually decide this election likely won’t pay attention until the final 60 days of the campaign. So while Harris has to have that substance ready to go, she also needs to keep her campaign where it is now in terms of messaging — “We’re not going back. We’re going forward. This is about you and it’s not about him.” That is what will likely convince the voters that Harris needs to win the White House in November.

Now, she’s been disqualified from representing a client in a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems in Washington, D.C., regarding allegedly false statements about the company’s role in that election. The company sued Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne for his baseless claims that Dominion ran the 2020 election, that its technology was developed by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and that it hired a truck to shred 3,000 pounds of ballots. Dominion said those statements were false and not only harmed the company’s reputation and business but also resulted in serious threats to its employees, their families, and election workers. It’s a high bar to disqualify a lawyer from representing a client. But Lambert cleared it for reasons explained by U.S. magistrate judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya. Indeed, the judge’s opinion Tuesday cited “at least five reasons that illustrate why Lambert’s conduct meets the high bar for disqualification”: Upadhyaya noted that Lambert had disclosed confidential Dominion case material in one of her own criminal cases and that she shared documents with a sheriff (who had no role in this litigation) who also publicly spread the information. “This is not a case of an inadvertent breach or good faith disclosure,” the judge wrote, calling it “unfathomable for Lambert to believe she could do whatever she wanted with Dominion’s Litigation Documents.” The judge also said that Byrne himself violated the protective order and that Dominion might seek sanctions against him. But Byrne wasn’t the subject of this opinion. Lambert was, in the latest example of Donald Trump-aligned lawyers facing consequences for going off the rails in the face of Trump’s 2020 election loss — some of whom might not be lawyers anymore when all is said and done.

87,Judge Merchan rejects Trump’s recusal bid — again — ahead of sentencing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-14 06:13:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-merchan-trump-recusal-rejection-rcna166190,"Judge Juan Merchan again declined to recuse himself from Donald Trump’s New York criminal case, rejecting the former president’s third attempt to get rid of the presiding judge in his so-called hush money case. Refusing to step aside in a decision dated Tuesday, Merchan called the GOP presidential nominee's arguments ""nothing more than a repetition of stale and unsubstantiated claims."" The judge noted that he was reiterating, ""for the third time, that which should already be clear - innuendo and mischaracterizations do not a conflict create. Recusal is therefore not necessary, much less required."" Merchan not only rejected the motion, but also called out Trump's counsel in the process. While noting that he welcomed zealous advocacy and creative lawyering, he recalled in his ruling that ""counsel has been warned repeatedly that such advocacy must not come at the expense of professional responsibility in one's role as an officer of the court."" The judge added: ""Counsel has merely repeated arguments that have already been denied by this and higher courts. Defense Counsel's reliance, and apparent citation to his own prior affirmation, rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims, is unavailing."" Trump’s latest recusal attempt, filed by defense lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, cited the fact of Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee as a reason for the judge to step aside because of his daughter’s political campaign-related work. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office called the defense move “a vexatious and frivolous attempt to relitigate an issue that was twice addressed by this Court in orders that the First Department then refused to disturb,” referring to the New York state appeals court. “Defendant identifies no new facts or changes in the law that warrant a different outcome,” the prosecution wrote to Merchan ahead of his ruling, pointing out that Trump’s previous motions already argued that Harris was Trump’s political opponent and that Merchan’s daughter would benefit from rulings in this case. The denial moves Trump one step closer to sentencing. But first, Merchan will need to rule on another Trump motion, to set aside his guilty verdicts in light of the Supreme Court's ruling granting broad presidential immunity. If Merchan also rejects that motion, sentencing would proceed on Sept. 18 on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, an “E” felony (the lowest-level New York state felony) that doesn’t mandate incarceration. Sentencing was supposed to happen in July, but the immunity decision pushed it back, raising the question of whether evidence was improperly introduced at trial that ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s newly concocted presidential immunity rule. Merchan will answer that complex question in the first instance in his ruling due Sept. 16, though the Supreme Court may eventually have the final word in all of Trump’s cases in which he invokes immunity.

Nonetheless, the Trump campaign says it has a perfectly good reason the candidate recently used a plane previously owned by the late Jeffrey Epstein to get to various campaign stops, as the Miami Herald reported.  According to the report:  The Herald went into a bit more detail later in the report, explaining how Trump’s decals had been placed on Epstein’s old plane so it resembled the one he owns.  Per the Herald: So there you have it, folks. Sure, Trump has flown on Epstein’s private jets plenty of times in the past, for reasons that remain unclear. But this time is different from all those times in that this one might just be coincidental. Glad the Trump camp cleared that up.  Still, I’d argue anything that even potentially reminds voters of Trump’s past experiences partying with Epstein or the fact Trump wished Epstein’s co-conspirator well in his sex trafficking case could be considered an own goal at this point."

Vice President Kamala Harris is going on the offense, and touting what she sees as her tough immigration record in a new campaign ad. Since she entered the race, Republicans have attacked Harris over the issue, falsely labeling her as the administration’s “border czar.” This ad is exactly what the vice president should be doing: You go in on the issue that your opponent thinks is your weakness and make it your strength. It’s something Harris has done effectively on the campaign trail already. And it’s something that I suspect she’ll do effectively at the debate next month.  It’s very simple and the facts speak for themselves here. In July, border crossings were lower than during Donald Trump’s last month in the White House. There’s also the border bill backed by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma — the most conservative immigration bill in decades. While Harris supported that deal, Trump stopped it — ordering House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson to kill the bill.  He did so because the bill would not only be good for those on the border who are concerned about illegal immigration, but also because it would be good news politically for President Joe Biden. The ad was an effective way for Harris’ campaign to hit back against Trump and Republicans’ misinformation on her immigration record. We’ll see how it plays with voters in the coming weeks."
90,JD Vance uses his wife to whitewash Trump’s white supremacist problem,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-13 12:30:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-usha-trump-white-supremacist-nick-fuentes-rcna166282,"Sen. JD Vance tried to paper over former President Donald Trump’s connection with white nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes during an interview over the weekend.  Speaking with ABC News’ Jon Karl, Vance was asked about Trump’s widely criticized dinner with Fuentes and the Hitler-loving rapper, Ye in 2022, as well as Fuentes’ recent comments that Trump shouldn't have picked Vance as a running mate in part because Vance’s wife, Usha, is Indian American. Trump’s VP pick agreed with Karl’s summation of Fuentes’ attacks on his wife as “racist garbage.”  But after Karl noted “this is also a guy that dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago during this campaign,” Vance chimed in with some spin.  He said: After Vance falsely claimed Trump condemned his own dinner with Fuentes amid the backlash, Karl corrected him and noted that Trump has never condemned Fuentes or his views.  And that’s when Vance claimed his wife’s personal interactions with Trump assured him.  He said:  Evidently, Vance wants us to believe Trump’s willingness to dine with an avowed white supremacist and a Nazi-loving rapper is merely a sign of his welcoming nature. And Vance doesn't appear to have any qualms about using his Indian American wife, or her purportedly amiable interactions with Trump, to downplay the questions about the candidate’s ties to white supremacy and antisemitic hate. Usha Vance previously sat for an interview and attempted to downplay her husband’s misogynistic ""childless cat ladies"" comment. Now, her husband is using her ethnicity and gender to downplay Trump’s deference to bigots. Republicans have spent the better part of the past two weeks ridiculously accusing Democrats of antisemitism after Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.  Meanwhile, Trump and the GOP’s open association with antisemitic figures, including Fuentes and Ye, go unmentioned. Republicans haven’t devised a cogent explanation for this hypocrisy. And if Vance’s remarks are any sign, they won’t anytime soon. "
91,Roger Stone says his email accounts were how the hackers got into the Trump campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-13 12:29:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/roger-stone-email-hack-trump-campaign-rcna166422,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Donald Trump who helped to push the fake electors scheme, told the Washington Post that one of his email accounts was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack that was targeting the Trump campaign. The news surrounding this hack has been moving quickly, so let's review the sequence of events so far.  The juicy story here is that one of the most mischievous and aggressively outspoken figures in Trump’s orbit was the one whose private communications appears to have compromised — and possibly compromised others in the Trump campaign, as well. But a notable subplot is the media’s markedly different response to hacked campaign documents when they come into their hands directly, as compared to the 2016 feeding frenzy over private communications stolen from the Clinton campaign and made public by Wikileaks. The Associated Press is out with a story on the media outlets that have thus far chosen not to publish documents they've received as a result of the hack.  Remember when Trump literally called on Russia to ""find"" missing Clinton emails and declared his love for WikiLeaks?  Now Trump is benefitting from a restraint that neither he nor the media have afforded other politicians in a similar situation.

92,Why Elon Musk’s hugely hyped X talk with Trump was so disappointing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-13 07:25:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-elon-musk-x-interview-zero-surprises-zero-appeal-rcna166309,"X owner Elon Musk hosted former President Donald Trump for a much-anticipated conversation on Spaces on Monday night. Musk — who has endorsed Trump and is actively using his wealth and influence to get him elected again — stressed at the outset that this would be a “non-adversarial” conversation aimed at “open-minded, independent voters who might be trying to make up their mind.” But before that performatively centrist intro, the event started much like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ glitch-plagued, campaign-imploding Twitter Spaces interview with Musk in May 2023 — disastrously. People looking to tune into the Musk-Trump conversation were mostly met with a blank purple square for more than 40 minutes.  Musk blamed the technical failure on a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. But as The Verge quickly reported, the rest of the site was operating just fine, indicating such an attack was highly unlikely.  As the delay dragged on, the billionaire Mark Pincus, another self-avowed Democrat for Trump,  tweeted in response to Musk's attack claim, “Its Dems fighting to ‘save’ Democracy from two massive disrupters!” [sic] Musk, ever the seeker of truth,  replied: “Yeah.” And that’s how Musk handled most of the conversation. He’d tee up Trump not with questions, but with semi-coherent pronouncements about illegal immigration or urban crime or how climate change is no big deal and we shouldn’t “demonize” oil and gas industry executives who are literally “saving civilization” as we speak. (Musk, during the conversation, described his own position on the topic as “pretty moderate.”) Trump would then reply in the same manner as his broadly panned RNC acceptance speech — interminably parroting random pieces of MAGA bromides. Musk would chirp into these soliloquies with an occasional “Yeah.”  Sometimes he’d sprinkle in an “I agree with you” or a “You make an interesting point.” But the alphaest of alpha male civilization-saving tech bros reduced himself to an unctuous hype man for an ever-more inarticulate Trump.  During the interview, Musk repeatedly said he’s been mostly apolitical throughout his life but also, confusingly, that he’s been a left-leaning Democrat his whole life.  And Musk wasn’t hiding the ball. He was quite clear on the point of this conversation — to convince persuadable voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is a Marxist, Israel-hating, open borders-advocating, cop-criminalizing supervillain. Moments later, they’d paint her as a cowardly, unaccomplished idiot not even smart enough to handle a conversation like the one they were having.  Musk and Trump both present as very needy men, perpetually thirsty for praise. So I’ll give them something: It is a remarkable achievement for two of the most powerful and influential right-wing political figures of our time to say essentially nothing of substance for over two hours and five minutes. Don, Elon — I’m impressed. To comprehensively fact-check this wet sandbox of rhetoric-heavy, meme-level political discourse is probably not worth the effort.  Suffice to say, Trump’s claims that the Democratic Republic of Congo is emptying its prisons to send them to the U.S. as migrants are not true. Nor is it true, as Trump insisted, that Harris is more left-wing than democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. It is also plainly untrue that Trump is a champion of free speech, as Musk declared.  As is Musk’s insistence that inflation — a global issue exacerbated by the pandemic — can be curbed simply by empowering something he called a “government efficiency commission” and deregulating all major industries (like the ones in which he owns companies). Whichever political direction one leans, economics are a little more complicated than that. But top men such as Musk and Trump are rarely told by their friends/employees that they’re not making any sense and that they should probably read up on the subject before pontificating in front of a million X Spaces listeners.  There were two moments where the conversation had a chance of becoming mildly interesting.  One was when Trump complained that artificial intelligence uses a lot of electricity. If Musk were as brave and inquisitive as his devotees claim, this would have been a great opportunity to show it. But the crypto-enthusiast Musk, rather than defend his preferred technologies’ outrageous use of energy, simply changed the subject back to his prospective “government efficiency commission.”  The other almost-interesting moment was when Trump rambled about certain places he says were made uninhabitable for thousands of years after nuclear plant accidents. Musk — for the first and only time in the conversation — pushed back on Trump, saying he’d been to Fukushima (the site of the nuclear plant disaster in 2011) and eaten locally grown vegetables.  Trump, in a role reversal, replied, “Yeah, yeah.” The pretense that people like Musk are courageous for hosting “civil” conversations like this remains ridiculous, but it’s a well-worn cliche at this point, the opposite of shocking.   And maybe I’m jaded by the lowering of standards that came with the rise of Trump, but there was nothing exceptional about this event. It was dull, uninformative and relentlessly repetitive. Both Musk and Trump have followers who would walk into the sea on their commands, but sitting through this entire thing takes a certain dedication. If you’re looking for two hours of overcompensating attempts at hypermasculinity, basic GOP fearmongering talking points about crime and immigration, and a touch of slobbering back-patting about free speech and civility — the Musk/Trump show is your ticket.

93,Trump is letting Vance do the heavy lifting. That could backfire.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-13 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-campaign-events-rcna166236,"I’ll give him this: Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has been hustling. The GOP’s vice presidential candidate spent the last week doing some heavy campaigning around the country before appearing on three Sunday shows. But it stands in stark contrast to how low-energy the guy at the top of the ticket, former President Donald Trump, has been since accepting the Republican nomination last month. If you were to ask Vance, it’s all part of the plan. The running mate is traditionally an attack dog for the nominee, a role that he has seemed eager to play in targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. But Trump’s slow pace is odd, even when you consider that August is traditionally a slow month in the presidential campaign season. At some point, if Vance is perceived as doing most of the heavy lifting for the campaign, that could become a major hindrance to Trump’s chances this fall. I’m not bringing up Trump’s sparse schedule to claim that the number of rallies a candidate holds is determinative of who wins an election. Nor am I saying anything similar about crowd sizes, no matter how much it irks him that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have been drawing huge audiences. It does, however, speak to electoral strategy and the lack of any sort of shift from Trump’s camp even as the race has fundamentally changed. When President Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Trump directed the Republican National Committee to divert funds from field operations and get-out-the-vote programs to focus on “election integrity.” His argument at the time was built on the belief that that’s still the greatest motivator to get his supporters out to the polls. But he hasn’t been putting himself out there nearly as much as that bravado would suggest. In fact, he held only a handful of events last week, not counting his hastily called fact-free press conference to try to draw the spotlight back to himself. This sluggishness wasn’t always the case with Trump. During his last two campaigns, he was a very different creature on the stump, sometimes holding multiple rallies in a single day, according to an analysis from The Washington Post’s Philip Bump. In contrast, the newly minted Democratic duo hit up seven stops over the course of five days, absolutely smoking Trump’s lethargic pace. And while it makes sense that the Harris-Walz ticket is in a hurry to introduce itself to voters with just under three months until Election Day, you’d think the Trump campaign would stress a similar urgency on its boss. Instead, it was left up to Vance to tail Harris and Walz around the swing states. The plan was to hit at Harris on issues on which the GOP feels she’s weak: immigration, crime and the economy. But as my colleague Jim Downie explained on Monday, those are all areas where things are improving as we get closer to Election Day, potentially blunting the Republican message against Democrats across the board. Vance’s appearances were also much more sparsely attended than the Harris-Walz events, setting up an unflattering contrast that couldn’t have made Trump happy. Even his attempts to directly confront Harris fell flat. Vance’s decision to literally do a press stop next to Air Force Two in Wisconsin didn’t produce much more than one of the most cringeworthy photo shoots of the election season. It doesn’t help that Vance isn’t exactly Mr. Popular these days. The messaging from Democrats since he was named Trump’s running mate appears to be sticking, according to recent polling. Since the GOP convention, Vance has “become more and more identified with his particular brand of conservatism and less with his famed biography as an author, veteran, and politician,” according to Semafor’s Kadia Goba. Tellingly, when you look at FiveThirtyEight’s polling aggregate, Vance’s unfavorable ratings are higher than Trump’s, which is really saying something. Vance is calling his stalking tour a win so far though, bragging about his Sunday show appearances on X while criticizing Harris’ lack of tough interviews since she became the presumptive nominee. As talking points go, focusing on whether Harris has done as many press appearances as he has doesn’t seem like a strong one. It honestly feels like a remnant of the race against Biden, when the main message was that Biden is too old to properly campaign. This all matters because beyond the energy and enthusiasm that have suffused throughout the Democratic base, the Harris campaign is using its events to sign up volunteers and do other ground-level work necessary to win in November. If Trump is still set to be the main GOTV force, he’s going to have to start pulling his weight rather than letting Vance be the voice of the ticket. And yet, it’s ironically Trump’s inability to stick to a message against Harris in his public appearances that has the potential to make Vance into the more reliable — if underwhelming — campaigner. There is still time for things to shift and Trump to pick up the pace again. Both he and Vance are going to be on the trail this week, including on Wednesday, when they’ll split North Carolina and Michigan between them. Vance will have the earlier appearance, but it’ll be worth seeing just how much more of a crowd Trump draws to his event. All told, the signs point to Vance’s anointment as the future of the MAGA movement as a bit premature — it turns out there’s still nobody quite like Donald Trump."
94,Republican candidate in North Carolina called for a Trump coup on Jan. 6,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-12 14:29:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/north-carolina-republican-trump-coup-michele-morrow-rcna166281,"This week brought yet another example of how Republican extremism may cost the party in a key state in November. A couple of months back, I wrote about the North Carolina GOP’s placing all of its bets on extreme candidates for statewide office, potentially creating an opening for moderate Democrats. At the time, I focused on attorney general candidate Dan Bishop, who compared Donald Trump’s treatment in his criminal court cases to being a Black Southerner in the Jim Crow era. But there’s also unabashedly bigoted gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson and Chad Brown, a lesser-known secretary of state candidate who has pushed the GOP’s bogus “election integrity” rhetoric and previously touted an endorsement from hate-mongering baseball legend Curt Schilling.  Another person on my list was Michele Morrow, the far-right superintendent candidate who has recorded herself complaining about people speaking foreign languages in public and, according to CNN, previously called for the execution of Democrats like President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.  Last week, CNN reported more disturbing details about Morrow’s past behavior.  According to CNN: CNN linked to public videos of Morrow at the Capitol during the deadly Jan. 6 riot, but it said it has no proof she entered the building or committed violence herself. Still, the video evidence — shared by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski — of Morrow effectively calling for a pro-Trump military coup after the riot failed is unsettling, given things we already know about her. In a few short months, Morrow could win control over North Carolina’s public school system. It’s a frightening prospect and one Democrats would be smart to highlight as they lay out the stakes of this race — along with others featuring GOP extremists in North Carolina — this November."
95,Debunking Trump's claim that the presidency was 'taken away' from Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-12 13:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-stolen-election-joe-biden-kamala-harris-fact-check-rcna166247,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 10 episode of ""Velshi."" After Donald Trump and his allies spent months dragging President Joe Biden for his age and mental acuity, they appeared to be caught flat-footed when someone younger and sharper took over the ticket. Now according to Trump, Americans are being ripped off because, get this, the campaign was stolen from Biden. Hearing Trump say that he cherishes the Constitution is pretty rich but this isn’t the first time he's made this claim. Trump has posted on Truth Social alleging, “the Democrats have Unconstitutionally taken a Candidate ... and unceremoniously replaced him with a new Candidate."" Team Trump has even likened the whole situation to a ""coup."" If you’re like me, you’ve been seeing versions of Trump’s lie all over social media. And maybe hearing it from your conservative uncle who likes to argue during family dinners. I don’t want to give credence to every ridiculous claim Trump throws out but this one seems worth debunking. So, for fact's sake, the presidency was not taken from Biden. Nor has Vice President Kamala Harris unconstitutionally robbed Biden of the Democratic nomination. In fact, the U.S. Constitution doesn't address the matter of party nomination processes. Here are some other talking points to politely provide to your extra-loud uncle: Biden won the vast majority of the Democratic delegates during the primary election process and clinched the presumptive nomination back in March. But he was not formally the Democratic nominee — he was the presumptive nominee. This allowed him to, after much consideration, step aside voluntarily. He was not kicked off the party ticket and while the whole gambit might’ve been a politically risky move, there’s nothing illegal about it. When Democratic primary voters selected Biden, Harris’ name was attached to his name and they chose her as vice president — you know, the role that takes over for the president if needed. So the argument that the American public did not have a chance to vote for Harris is categorically false. Also, they will have a chance to vote for her, or not vote for her, on Nov. 5.  The Democratic Party has a lot of rules in place for a situation as serious as a presidential election. There are rules for this exact scenario. Harris, in order to officially take Biden’s place on the ticket, needed to secure support from at least 2,350 Democratic convention delegates, including those who already pledged their support to Biden, and the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders dubbed the “superdelegates.”  Lo and behold, she did that. The Democratic National Committee had a virtual roll call to make sure everything was squared away and it was announced that Harris secured enough delegate votes to become the party’s nominee. To avoid any complications when it came to the physical ballot — the Democratic Party held that virtual roll call to make sure that Harris’ name, along with that of her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could be printed on the ballots by an Aug. 7 certification deadline. If the Democratic Party wanted to replace its nominee after the convention, that would be a different story. Though it still wouldn’t be unconstitutional, because the Constitution is silent on party nominations. Anyone who tells you otherwise is woefully misunderstanding this process or being deliberately misleading. As the MaddowBlog's Steve Benen puts it: But if Trump wants to talk about things that are unconstitutional and an attempt to steal an election away from the people ...

96,Trump cites Judge Cannon in seeking compensation for the Mar-a-Lago search,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-12 12:30:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-legal-filing-mar-a-lago-damages-rcna166222,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon and the Supreme Court have already helped Donald Trump in his criminal cases. Now he's using them to support his request for civil damages, too. A lawyer for the former president is citing Cannon and the justices in a filing that serves as a precursor to a possible federal lawsuit stemming from the 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property and subsequent charges for alleged unlawful retention of national defense information and obstruction. The filing may be best understood as a political document — claiming, as it does, “political persecution” against the GOP presidential nominee. But it’s notable how it leans on Trump’s own judicial appointees to justify that persecution narrative — even if closer inspection reveals that their rulings might not support this civil effort, however much they have helped him in his criminal cases. Cannon dismissed the classified documents case last month on the grounds that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded — a decision that Smith is challenging on appeal. The former president also invokes the recent Supreme Court ruling granting broad presidential immunity from prosecution, arguing in support of his civil “malicious prosecution” claim that: That argument is a little difficult to follow. Putting aside the relevance of Garland’s legal foresight, the Supreme Court broke new ground last month with a new (and vague) presidential immunity test. Whatever anyone might have guessed the court would do ahead of time, it wasn’t apparent until long after Mar-a-Lago was searched and Trump was charged. Plus, while the high court said that presidents get at least some immunity for official acts, that ruling came in the federal election interference case — not in the classified documents case, whose charges relate to Trump’s post-presidency conduct. Cannon likewise broke new ground last month when she dismissed the classified documents case. But that ruling didn’t deal with the underlying merits of the prosecution or the court-approved search that Trump complains of in his civil filing. There’s also the fact that it’s a trial-level ruling currently on appeal. Even if it survives appeal, it’s still difficult to see how Cannon’s decision on Smith’s appointment and funding calls into question the Mar-a-Lago search, which predated Smith’s appointment.   Trump also cites Cannon and the immunity ruling in his civil “abuse of process” claim — his third argument, in addition to malicious prosecution and “intrusion upon seclusion” (essentially, an invasion of privacy claim). In making his abuse of process argument, Trump’s counsel writes that “the lack of appropriations, a lack of a constitutionally appropriate appointment, and the unconstitutional nature of prosecuting an immune former President reflect the misuse of the prosecutorial process for an inappropriate — that is, a political — end.” But again, even if the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling somehow affects the classified documents case, and even if Cannon’s dismissal is upheld on appeal, it’s unclear how these rulings — which came after Trump was searched and charged — signal legal abuse in retrospect. There’s more to say about this new civil filing, and it’s unclear if it will turn into a full lawsuit or what will come of it if it does. The reason that it doesn’t go straight into court is that this sort of legal action against the federal government, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, starts with filing a notice to the agency involved — here, the Department of Justice, which can respond within six months. Trump claims $15 million in compensatory damages for alleged harm from legal costs, and $100 million in punitive damages (though, perhaps importantly if this moves forward, courts have noted that punitive damages aren’t available in FTCA cases). Whatever the outcome of this development, if it does go to court, it could test the degree to which Trump's luck in some of his criminal cases may extend to a civil case.

97,We have more questions than answers about Trump campaign’s hack claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-12 12:07:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-hacking-trump-campaign-jd-vance-rcna166162,"Politico reported Saturday that last month it began receiving internal documents, reportedly assessed as authentic by two knowledgeable sources, that seem to have been hacked from within the Trump campaign. Also on Saturday, The Washington Post revealed that it had received similar documents two days before. The Trump campaign issued a statement Saturday asserting that it had been hacked and blamed Iran. As a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, I have questions. The documents in question reportedly include a 271-page research document containing the results of Trump’s vetting of vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Forbes referred to that document as Vance’s “dirty laundry dossier,” implying that it might contain information painting Vance in a more unfavorable light than the struggling candidate is already in. Politico provided intriguing details of the email it received offering the material:  “The person said they had a ‘variety of documents from [Trump’s] legal and court documents to internal campaign discussions.’ Asked how they had obtained the documents, the person responded: ‘I suggest you don’t be curious about where I got them from. Any answer to this question, will compromise me and also legally restricts you from publishing them.’” Here are three questions that should be foremost on our minds as we process this alleged foreign attack on our election process. First, could it be true? Reports of the hack are eerily consistent with a report Friday from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center. Microsoft said Iran had “launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.” The Microsoft report then gets even more specific: “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.” That scenario reportedly matches the description of what happened to Trump’s campaign. Microsoft said it “notified those targeted.” Trump, on his Truth Social platform, said he was the person Microsoft had notified. Trump and Microsoft aren’t the only ones pointing to Iran. Just last month, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) publicly warned us of Iran’s intentions to influence the U.S. presidential election and to sow discord in America. When it comes to trying to mess with our election, this isn’t Iran’s first rodeo. According to a declassified ODNI report, in 2020 Iran “carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects.” As that election approached, Facebook announced it had disrupted Iranian and Russian operations aimed at U.S. election interference. Iran has the motive and means to carry out a cyber hack against the Trump campaign. The country wants revenge for Trump’s 2020 decision to assassinate top Qods Force general, Qassem Soleimani, by missile strike as he arrived in Baghdad. In fact, Iran doesn’t seek to simply eliminate Trump as a candidate but to eliminate him altogether. After the attempted assassination of Trump last month at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, we learned that U.S. intelligence agencies had detected an Iranian plot to kill the former president. On Aug. 6, a Pakistani man with ties to Iran was arrested by the FBI on charges of plotting to assassinate  a U.S. official not yet publicly identified. Second, what are the reasons to doubt that the documents were hacked by Iran? Despite all the evidence pointing to Iran, we don’t yet have the proverbial smoking gun, or laptop, in the hands of an Iranian operative. That kind of evidence may come soon, but in the interim, we might ask what else could have happened here? After all, the fruits of a successful state-sponsored malware attack against a presidential nominee ending up in the hands of a solely digital political newsroom might seem a bit, well, weird. And, while Politico may have been figuring out what to do with its unsolicited “gift,” whoever had possession of the documents may have grown impatient and forwarded it to the more traditional influencer, The Washington Post. Could someone within the Trump campaign have leaked the documents, and why? Well, a document containing potentially injurious details on the fledgling vice presidential pick could bolster calls for his ouster. Trump can’t like the fact that he has had to increasingly defend his choice of Vance. At least one former Trump staffer insists that Trump has to replace Vance, who has already been labeled a “historically unpopular pick.” Two things can be true at the same time. Iran is intent on interfering with our next election. Yet, could it also be true that, having been warned by Microsoft of the Iranian threat, someone with the Trump campaign decided to leverage that knowledge and leak some embarrassing data about Vance, then blame Iran? We don’t yet know the timing of Microsoft’s notification to Iran’s target, but we know Microsoft started spotting Iran’s efforts against the campaign in June. The hack, or appearance thereof, also allows Trump to play the victim — a role he seems to relish. If things don’t go his way in November, don’t be surprised if Trump blames Iran, the U.S. Intelligence Community, Politico and The Washington Post for his demise. Third, why should we care? Word of the Iran hacking allegation immediately triggered a tsunami of skepticism and even outright rejection of the claim across social media. The disbelief is understandable. Trump is a polished pro at lies and deceit, and the public, even when equipped with the latest intelligence on Iran’s cyber efforts, knows it can’t take anything Trump says at face value. The U.S. intelligence community is feverishly working to thwart foreign power attempts to disrupt our election. The FBI said it was “aware of the media reporting” on the Trump campaign incident, but declined to comment. That’s why I’m calling on the Trump campaign to fully cooperate with any FBI investigation of the alleged Iranian attack, if it isn’t cooperating already. The FBI should be as transparent as possible with its findings — given the constraints of classified details — as quickly as possible. If our intelligence agencies determine that Iran really did compromise the campaign of a major party's presidential nominee, and we’ve reached the point where we’re so distrustful that we can’t rally against a foreign adversary’s attack on our processes, the adversary wins. We know that the Department of Justice is already reticent to do anything that might affect the outcome of an election this close to Election Day, even including the opening of a counterintelligence or criminal investigation “related to politically sensitive individuals and entities.” But, not letting us know if a nominee — any nominee — has or has not been allegedly attacked by a foreign power may have the unintended consequence of depriving us of information we need to assess before we vote."
98,Trump's false claims about A.I. crowd photos are incredibly ironic,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-12 10:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ai-photos-harris-crowd-false-claims-rcna166229,"Seemingly stumped in efforts to stem the energy surrounding Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Donald Trump is asking voters not to believe what they can see with their own eyes. In social media posts shared Sunday, Trump falsely accused the Harris campaign of using artificial intelligence to generate images of large crowds at her events. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. He continued, saying, “She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the ‘crowd’ looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches. This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING.” To be clear: the crowds were real. The Truth Social post included an image from a Detroit-area airport rally that drew thousands of people, as NBC News reported. And while Trump said there was “nobody at the plane” when she arrived, you can see her being greeted by a large crowd as she steps off her plane in footage captured by NBC News. You can also see an image of her plane being welcomed by a large crowd here. And a Getty photographer confirmed the large crowd to The Daily Beast. Trump is no stranger to getting crowd sizes wrong. He's notoriously obsessed with inflating the crowds at his own events. And his claim that Harris was waving at nobody is particularly rich considering he's the one who has been captured in a video appearing to wave at nonexistent crowds in footage his campaign has shared to give the impression he’s immensely popular. It's also ironic that Trump is claiming that Harris is sharing A.I.-generated images for political gain when he and his followers have done just that. In one example, he used his social media platform to share an image that appeared to depict him praying in a church, only for the image to be called out as fake after people noticed he had six fingers on both hands. And Trump’s followers have shared other A.I.-generated images depicting him around Black people to give the impression he’s popular among Black folks. So his claims about Harris fit his pattern of accusing other people of doing things he has himself already done. But they also suggest his desperation over Harris’ apparent popularity is growing, as is his seemingly increasing public detachment from reality and his insistence that followers join him in undermining faith in democracy.  If he can convince his supporters that the photographs are fake, it's a short step to convincing them that any votes for her in November are bogus, too."
99,"‘And really, THAT song?’: Céline Dion rebukes Trump’s use of ‘Titanic’ anthem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-12 08:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/celine-dion-titanic-song-trump-rally-rcna166211,"Céline Dion has joined the long list of musicians who have rebuked the use of their music at Donald Trump’s campaign events. After a video of Dion performing her hit song “My Heart Will Go On” was shown at Trump’s rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday, the Canadian singer expressed her disapproval in a statement posted on X. “Today, Celine Dion’s management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc., became aware of the unauthorized usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing ‘My Heart Will Go On’ at a Donald Trump / JD Vance campaign rally in Montana,” Dion posted.  “In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use. …And really, THAT song?” The romantic ballad, released as the theme to the 1997 film “Titanic,” is an odd choice for a political rally, as campaigns generally avoid imagery of sinking ships. The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris took note of the irony, posting a video of the song playing at the rally with the caption, “Trump campaign plays the theme from the Titanic at his rally.”  The song was in keeping with Trump's more unorthodox approach to campaign music, which ranges from the usual patriotic anthems such as Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” to unexpected picks such as the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and musical theater numbers from “The Phantom of the Opera.” That wide-ranging taste has also gotten Trump in trouble. Since 2016, many prominent musicians have disavowed Trump’s use of their music at his campaign events  — so many, in fact, that there’s a Wikipedia page titled “Musicians who oppose Donald Trump’s use of their music.” Dion reportedly turned down an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration in 2017."
100,Trump back in the White House would be very bad for the bears,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-11 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-endangered-species-grizzly-bears-gray-wolves-rcna164898,"Although former President Donald Trump has very  publicly distanced himself from the conservative Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 plan, we should take seriously much of what the 920-page document tells us about a potential second Trump term.   For one, if Trump wins in November, he may end federal protections for grizzly bears, gray wolves and the greater sage grouse, as the document proposes removing the three animals from the federal government’s list of endangered species. Environmental groups warn removing the species from protected lists would open them up to being hunted or killed by traps meant to protect farms and ranches while facing loss of critical habitat. Unsurprisingly, a politically-motivated group making decisions about protected and endangered species has the potential to create a ripple effect of problems.  As Andrea Zaccardi, a carnivore conservation legal director for the Center of Biological Diversity, points out, “The proponents of Project 2025 don’t understand that the protection of species is supposed to be a science-based decision and not a political one.”  Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973, the Endangered Species Act allows the federal government to protect species at risk of extinction from being killed, harmed or harassed. Once the population has rebounded, the species can be delisted, which leaves protection in the hands of state governments that environmentalists argue would not take strong enough action. Delisting endangered species is supposed to be done when federal scientists think it is no longer necessary, but it’s not unheard of to become political as well. Grizzly bears are a perfect example. Before western expansion, the lower 48 states had over 50,000 grizzly bears, with a range from Central Mexico to the Great Plains. But by 1975, when they were officially listed as an endangered species, the number of grizzlies in the continental United States had dipped below 1,000. Since then, they’ve been a success story, with a particularly successful effort to reintroduce grizzlies in a portion of Montana and the three states around Yellowstone National Park — the two areas where Project 2025 calls for delisting them. As of 2022, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem was estimated to have 965 bears, while the Northern Continental Divide in Montana was estimated at 1,138 — as much as triple the numbers in 1975. But the population of grizzlies has not improved much in two other ecosystems in Washington state and Idaho. Ivan London, a senior attorney at Mountain States Legal Foundation, said in an email that the grizzly bear should have never been listed under the Endangered Species Act in the first place. He argues that the government was wrong to divide the grizzly population into several ecosystems treated separately and should have considered the overall number of grizzlies in the entire United States. “The Endangered Species Act has turned into a lever of power that federal regulators use to extend their reach onto private and state property. This allows them to police activities that they would otherwise have no authority to oversee,” London said in an email. “Several ESA listings are based on outdated or otherwise questionable information, making the regulatory decisions to list or continue listing several species simply unreasonable. If the three species were delisted, the federal government would no longer have any say in protecting them. That would leave state governments entirely in charge of their future. For some critics of the listing, that’s the point. Mark Jones, national director for hunter outreach for Gun Owners of America, argues that the grizzly bear populations have rebounded enough that they should be delisted, and any effort to keep them on there is due to national politics interfering with the science. Jones, a Wyoming resident and a certified wildlife biologist, said that has “cheapened” the Endangered Species Act. “There’s a lot of resentment in Wyoming for the federal government because it’s ignoring its own law,” he said. But Zaccardi said there’s good reason to doubt that western states would take strong enough action. She notes that Idaho and Wyoming already passed laws that would allow trophy hunting of grizzly bears if they are delisted, while there would be strong incentives for state lawmakers to allow more killing of grizzlies and gray wolves, which will sometimes attack cattle and sheep. “The agricultural industry is not a big fan of predators,” she said. For now, grizzlies, gray wolves and the sage grouse are protected from trophy hunters, ranchers and real-estate developers. But that could change quickly if Trump wins in November, allowing politics to control an already politically charged policy. Ultimately, while some of the species have met the qualifications for delisting, the species are too fragile for removal. It should be the responsibility of all involved parties to keep animals under protection until science says it isn’t needed — not left to political manifestos and economics. "
101,"In his helicopter story, Trump may have confused Willie Brown with another Black politician",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-10 16:54:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-helicopter-willie-brown-nate-holden-rcna166097,"Donald Trump’s apparent confusion about a Black politician who was with him on a dangerous helicopter ride has highlighted his lack of credibility — and renewed concerns about the former president’s cognitive health. At a press conference on Thursday, the former president attacked Vice President Kamala Harris and recounted having experienced an emergency landing in a helicopter with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, whom he claimed to know “pretty well.” (Trump has repeatedly questioned whether Harris’ career was boosted by her relationship with Brown, whom she dated.) “We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing,” Trump said. “This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was — he was a little concerned.” Trump’s account raised eyebrows, given that news of such an incident involving him and Brown, who is 90, had never been previously reported. Brown quickly denied the claim, telling NBC News that he’d never even been in a helicopter with Trump. At the time, some outlets, including NBC News, speculated that Trump may have confused the former San Francisco mayor, who is Black, with former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who is white. In 2018, Trump had been in a helicopter with the then-governor and his successor, now-Gov. Gavin Newsom, to assess the damage from wildfires to the town of Paradise. But both Jerry Brown’s and Newsom’s teams denied that that helicopter ride was ever endangered; Jerry Brown’s spokesperson also told NBC News that there had been no discussion of Harris on that trip. Then on Friday, Nate Holden, a former Los Angeles City Council member and state senator, told Politico that he had in fact been in a helicopter with Trump when it made an emergency landing in the 1990s, and suggested that the GOP presidential nominee had confused Willie Brown with him instead. “Willie is the short Black guy living in San Francisco. I’m a tall Black guy living in Los Angeles,” said Holden, 95. “I guess we all look alike.” Trump’s brother Robert and an executive from his company, Barbara Res, were also aboard the helicopter with Holden. Res wrote about the incident in her memoir, and she told Politico that although Trump liked to joke that Holden “turned white” from fear during the emergency landing, it was in fact Trump who was “scared s---less.” The controversy raises questions about Trump’s mental fitness. At 78, Trump is facing the same concerns about his age and mental acuity that he has previously attacked 81-year-old President Joe Biden for — concerns that his torturously rambling and misleading Thursday press conference did very little to allay. Trump has continued to insist that he is not misremembering which politician was with him on the helicopter. On Friday, he claimed to The New York Times that he had flight records (though he did not produce them) and threatened to sue the newspaper. The Trump campaign did not respond to an NBC News request for comment."
102,Trump’s hopes in Arizona could be dimming. Here’s why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 15:50:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-arizona-2024-election-harris-rcna166027,"Momentum appears to be swinging in favor of Kamala Harris’ campaign in the Grand Canyon State. Although I’m not one who places a whole lot of stake in poll numbers, some of the recent numbers in Arizona have been favorable to the Democratic nominee. But there are other signs that Donald Trump’s electoral prospects could be dimming in the desert. One piece of evidence is the budding Republican support for Harris. John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, recently endorsed the Harris campaign and agreed to co-chair an advisory committee for the national “Republicans for Harris” effort. Giles’ endorsement underscores two things in particular. First, it speaks to Arizona’s trend toward Democrats over the past decade. For instance, Mesa has gone from one of the most conservative cities in the country to one with more liberal leanings. And the endorsement also shows that a strain of anti-Trump conservatism remains in Arizona, where Trump’s attacks on the late Sen. John McCain have undermined his standing with some Republicans in the state. Senate candidate Kari Lake, another high-profile Republican on the Arizona ballot this fall, has garnered intraparty backlash herself for her attacks on McCain and fellow Republicans. Many in Lake’s own party are backing her Democratic opponent, Ruben Gallego. In fact, she might even be a drag on Trump’s election chances. And on top of that, on Friday, the Harris campaign received a historic endorsement from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy group for Latinos. That could prove very helpful in Arizona, where Latinos make up about a third of the population. Recent data on Latino voters indicates that Harris is attracting and energizing these voters in Arizona — where Latinos were vital in helping Joe Biden flip the state in 2020 — and other battleground states. Trump’s campaign and its surrogates have sought to make gains with Latino voters — albeit in some rather dubious ways. But if Harris is able to maintain the Latino support Biden received in 2020, or even expand it, that could prove calamitous for Trump’s electoral hopes in Arizona. Beyond that, Arizona residents will be voting on a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. With voters in other states siding with abortion-rights supporters on similar measures in recent years, this could create yet another hurdle for Trump in Arizona. None of this means Trump can’t win the Grand Canyon State. But he certainly hasn’t made it easy on himself."
103,"Why pro-Palestinian protesters are going after Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 14:02:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-gaza-israel-protests-obama-dreamers-rcna166006,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of “Alex Wagner Tonight,” guest hosted by Ali Velshi. The last time Democrats sought to hold onto the White House after four years in power was in 2012, when then-President Barack Obama was running against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Romney was not the most conservative candidate in the Republican Party, even back then. But he had staked out an aggressive hard-right position on the issue of immigration, running on a platform of “self-deportation” — making life so hard for immigrants in this country that they have no choice but to leave. Given that, it probably surprised a lot of people that young undocumented immigrants had chosen to spend their time and energy protesting … President Obama. They held mass demonstrations outside the White House where many were arrested. They showed up at his campaign offices in California, carrying signs that read, “Obama stop deporting Dreamers.” Protesters even held a hunger strike sit-in at Obama’s campaign offices in the then-swing state of Colorado. At issue were protections for Dreamers, people who were brought to this country without legal authorization as children, many of whom had lived in the U.S. almost their entire lives. Obama supported protections for those Dreamers, but he insisted that he could not grant them those protections alone. He said the Republican-controlled Congress would have to send him a bill. But then, in June of 2012, right in the middle of the campaign, something remarkable happened: Obama came around and decided to try. He announced that he would grant protection to thousands of Dreamers through executive order.  The pressure worked and Obama was re-elected with strong support from the Latino community, despite the protests. However, much to the chagrin of the Obama administration, the protests didn’t stop. Many of those Dreamers were now protected, but there were still some who weren’t. And the parents of those Dreamers could still be deported at any moment. So those activists kept pushing, even interrupting the president during speaking events. Obama, again, insisted that he did not have the power to take those actions alone. But activists kept the pressure on. The following year, Obama moved again, using another executive order to shield even more Dreamers from deportation and deprioritize the deportation of people without criminal records. There were plenty of people at the time who questioned the strategy of those protesters, who asked why they weren’t protesting Romney and the Republicans in Congress who were blocking progress on immigration reform; but those protesters understood a key part of how social movements work. They understood that sometimes in order to make real change you have to target the people who are moveable, the people who want you in their coalition, the people who actually care. That is both the burden and the beauty of what it means to be part of a functioning, big-tent political party that's responsive to social change — to be on the side of what the late Rep. John Lewis called “good trouble.” On Wednesday, at a rally in Detroit, Vice President Kamala Harris was interrupted by a group of demonstrators protesting the war in Gaza. After their second interruption, Harris shut down the protesters, telling them, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” That’s a snappy line that makes for a good soundbite and it’s undeniably true that she will be a better president for their cause than Donald Trump. But, as those immigration protesters proved back in the Obama administration, these issues are more complicated than “we’re better for you than the other guys.” Harris has already proven she is the kind of thoughtful leader who listens and that she understands the nuance of this particular issue, even while some continue to insist that neither nuance nor context matters on this story. Her campaign presents a real opportunity to reset the relationship with the varied communities expressing dissatisfaction over this war, and America’s role in it. But will the Harris campaign use this as an opportunity to listen? And can those protesters use this as an opportunity to be heard?

104,MAGA influencers say Trump is on track to lose the election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 13:05:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-election-laura-loomer-nick-fuentes-maga-rcna166003,"Concerned about Donald Trump’s prospects of winning the presidential election, some right-wing influencers are lashing out over what they feel has been a weak campaign. Laura Loomer, a bigoted conspiracy theorist and social media troll whom Trump has praised repeatedly, sounded the alarm on X on Thursday. “President Trump needs to make some serious changes in his campaign ASAP,” she wrote in part. “The ground game is not sufficient. “The offense is lacking. “The communication is dismal. “The momentum is crashing. “Why are people who want to assist being pushed away instead of being embraced?” I don’t know precisely what Loomer means about people who want to assist being pushed away, though her outlandish behavior has, at times, made her a tad too toxic for some Trump supporters to associate with. Lately, however, Trump has had no problem sharing her bigoted, baseless attacks concerning Kamala Harris’ biracial identity, as he and other conservatives have falsely questioned the vice president’s Blackness. In the replies and quote tweets on Loomer’s post about Trump’s ground game, there was some pushback. But a number of popular MAGA enthusiasts were in agreement with her. That includes white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who wrote on X that his former dinner mate’s campaign is in a “death spiral” and listed his grievances. In the comments replying to his post, Fuentes faced a deluge of angry backlash. More criticism came from popular conservative pundit John Cardillo, who claimed on X that far-right activist group Turning Point USA and other pro-Trump groups are out of their depth. “Guys, we do not have a ground game,” he wrote in part. “Outsourcing that most critical function to TPUSA Action and two other untested PACs are not the actions of a campaign serious about winning. “Frankly, it’s insane.” Predictably, Cardillo faced blowback from TPUSA members and affiliates, who insisted that their efforts to help Trump have been moving swimmingly along. We’ll know in just a few months. But for the time being, there’s clearly discontent and division in MAGA world, with many Trump supporters worried about a campaign they think is primed to lose."
105,Why isn’t Donald Trump spending more time on the campaign trail?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 12:54:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/isnt-donald-trump-spending-time-campaign-trail-rcna166022,"While his criminal trial unfolded in May, Donald Trump routinely complained that the legal proceedings represented “election interference.” To back up his rhetoric, the former president had a habit of telling reporters, “I’d like to be campaigning.” As the argument went, the Republican candidate wanted to be on the campaign trail — holding rallies, meeting voters, attending fundraisers, doing photo-ops, etc. — and the fact that he was stuck in a criminal courtroom a few days per week was interfering with his electoral opportunities. There were, however, a couple of glaring problems with the claim. For one thing, criminal proceedings aren’t simply put on indefinite hold when a defendant seeks elected office. For another, there were plenty of off-days in the trial, when Trump could’ve held campaign events. He didn’t bother. Three months later, the trial has run its course — a jury found the Republican guilty of 34 felonies — and the GOP nominee still isn’t maintaining much of a campaign schedule. CNBC reported: In August 2016, the then-candidate held 27 campaign rallies across 15 states. As August 2024 gets underway, Trump has held one event so far, and over the last six weeks, he’s only held eight. The Washington Post ran a related analysis, further documenting just how much the Republican candidate has slowed his schedule down this year. Asked at his meandering press conference about his light schedule, the former president called it a “stupid question,” before adding that he doesn’t believe he has to campaign to win. “I’m leading by a lot,” Trump said. The problem, of course, is that the line of inquiry wasn’t stupid — and he isn’t leading by a lot. The result is a good question for which there is no obvious answer: Why isn’t Trump campaigning more? Perhaps he has no idea how competitive the 2024 race has become. Maybe he’s become lazier. Perhaps he’s come to believe holding campaign events doesn’t help much. Maybe there’s an undisclosed health issue. It’s impossible to say for sure from a distance. Whatever the explanation, Trump’s next campaign event is in Montana — which is nowhere near a battleground state — not because he’s trying to give his campaign a boost, but because of a personal vendetta against a Democratic senator who bothered him six years ago. It’s quite a strategy."
106,Tim Walz deserves better than Team Trump's 'stolen valor' smears,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 12:08:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-military-record-vance-trump-stolen-valor-rcna165978,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of the finest people I’ve known in politics. He’s a leader of integrity, honor, humility and fight. He’s also a veteran who cares deeply about the well-being of his fellow veterans. Which is why it’s enraging and sad to watch Ohio senator and fellow veteran JD Vance and Team Trump attempt to smear his military record and accuse him of “stolen valor.” “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him — a fact that he’s been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,” Vance, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday. The truth is that Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and retired honorably before his run for Congress in 2005. As an artilleryman, Walz “served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and was the highest-ranking enlisted National Guard Soldier in southern Minnesota when he retired from 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery in 2005,” according to the U.S. Army. Building on this experience, Walz has dedicated his political career to helping other veterans. As the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, veterans had no finer and more tenacious advocate than Walz. Every veteran service organization and veteran leader knows he is one of our own, and that we could always count on him. He knows how to get things done in Washington and for his communities. And he always has our back, from the new GI Bill expansion way back in 2008 to the Clay Hunt SAV Act in 2016 to countless fights in between.  The Democrats had to pick a veteran. And they picked one whom everyone knows, respects and trusts. (And one Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other key party leaders know, respect and trust.) Walz is a patriotic, down to earth and lovable bulldog.  If the Democrats weren’t going to pick a Republican or true independent — or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly — I believe Walz is their best chance to win. Pew research from 2022 showed “about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners (66%) say they like political leaders who have military experience,” with men generally more likely to regard military service as a positive.  Walz still embodies the spirit of his high school football coaching career. He knows how to spot talent, support teammates, make people better, rally diverse groups and encourage a team to victory. And he’s a fighter. Especially in hard times.  The loss of his brother Craig in 2016 was an unthinkable tragedy. But Walz rallied his family through it — like he can rally our country through all this pain and uncertainty now. He understands suffering, he understands working people, he understands national security, he understands America.  And he understands how to punch back. He’s also more liberal than me (and plenty of other Americans), and that will surely challenge him with independents and moderates. And with Walz and Harris together, the Democrats are going to have to fight incredibly hard to show they’re more moderate than the narrative suggests.  Republicans are already weaponizing the fact that Walz was Sen. Bernie Sanders’ preferred pick.  And now, they’re pulling one of their oldest, nastiest and most effective plays out of the playbook, by attacking Walz’s service.  The Harris-Walz campaign was clearly not ready for the Swift boat attacks — but they were entirely predictable. Details, military records and validators who know Walz and the truth should have been buttoned up in advance, ready at the announcement, and shared with the public and media. Unfortunately, they were not.  This is an unnecessary communications and strategy failure, and a reflection of a deeper lack of military and veterans cultural competency in the Democratic Party. This problem also exists in the GOP (to a lesser degree) and indeed all across our society. And it is an important reminder that we need more veterans across the political, media, education and business ecosystem. But the lack of representation — and resulting ignorance — is especially painful in politics. Just ask former Sens. Jim Webb (Virginia) or Bob Kerrey (Nebraska).  The Trump campaign hired Chris LaCivita — a longtime political operative who led the “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” back in 2004 and helped sink Vietnam veteran John Kerry’s campaign — months ago. There’s no reason why Democrats should have been caught flat-footed this time around. Indeed, whether the Swift boat attacks are fair or not, the Harris-Walz campaign should have been more prepared for battle. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Now the campaign (and Walz himself), need to get a plan together, be transparent, clear and forceful, and make up the ground lost. And, where they can, counterattack smartly. This is the first battle of its kind for this new Democratic ticket. But it definitely won’t be the last. Every vote and foot of political ground taken is critical to victory. Especially with veterans — and especially with independent veterans in swing states.  I’d like to live in an America where nobody attacks a veteran's service or tries to compare one term of service to another. Every person who volunteers to wear the uniform has done something for our country that 99% of the public has not. And that should be respected — whether they’re a Navy SEAL hunting Osama Bin Laden or a cook making breakfast for other troops stateside at Fort Liberty. Service to our country is honorable. And one of the most dangerous jobs in America, whether you’re combat deployed or training back home.  But we live in this America. And no matter what anyone says, Tim Walz is incredibly sincere, hard-working, tough and likable. He’s a leader of integrity and character. He’s the opposite of ""weird."" And, yes, he’s funny.  He will change some hearts and minds. Hopefully, enough to beat Trump.  I’m just one veteran. But I’m rooting for him."
107,"On abortion rights, Trump keeps creating opportunities for Dems",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 12:01:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/abortion-rights-trump-keeps-creating-opportunities-dems-rcna166008,"In the spring, Donald Trump raised a few eyebrows by confirming — out loud, on camera, and on the record — that he was “looking at” possible restrictions on contraception. The former president eventually walked that back, but not before he created an opportunity that Democrats are already exploiting. In the summer, he’s doing it again. At his long, meandering press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump began by assuring the public that voters don’t much care about reproductive rights — a line Republicans have clung to in recent years, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary — before lying about the Democratic agenda in deeply ugly ways. All of which set the stage for the pièce de resistance. NBC News reported: The GOP nominee went on to argue that there are “many things on a humane basis that you can do outside of that.” The audio in the clip isn’t great, but NBC News’ Garrett Haake posted a written transcript of the exchange online, which reinforces the fact that Trump didn’t appear to have any idea what he was talking about. In fact, all things considered, it’s reasonable to wonder whether the former president has any idea what mifepristone is. For those unfamiliar with the medication — a group that apparently includes the Republican nominee — the FDA approved it nearly a quarter of a century ago, to be used as part of a two-step process to terminate unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks. The drug has proven to be safe, effective, and commonly used. A notorious Trump-appointed judge in Texas curtailed access to the drug, though he was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Nevertheless, many on the right still harbor hopes that the Republican, in a second term, might enforce the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of drugs used for abortions by mail. Indeed, all of this is part of the right-wing Project 2025 agenda, written in large part by members of Team Trump. It was against this backdrop that the GOP candidate left the door wide open to revoking access to the medication during the Q&A at Mar-a-Lago. Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez wasted little time in seizing on the comments from the press conference. “Already, women across the country are suffering because of the nightmare Donald Trump unleashed by overturning Roe v. Wade,” she said. “That reality — women forced to the brink of death before receiving the care they need, doctors facing the threat of jail time for doing their jobs, and survivors of rape and incest made to flee their states for basic health care — will only get worse if Donald Trump wins and wipes out access to medication abortion.”"
108,Donald Trump and JD Vance are failing America's favorite political test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 10:09:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-vance-harris-walz-beer-question-rcna165834,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 7 episode of ""The Reid Out."" Let’s talk about joy — no not me, Joy, but the feeling of joy. More specifically, the joy being felt by Americans backing the Harris-Walz ticket. A joy that is palpable and pervasive.  We saw that joy on full display, with massive crowds greeting Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at their rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday. It feels like we are experiencing another 2008 Obama moment. The energy, the excitement, the enthusiasm. It feels fun. Imagine that, American politics … joyful again. The 2024 presidential election has quickly become the tale of two tickets: one radiates joy and the other is dour and frankly, frightening. And it’s clear that has Republicans freaking out. Harris has not only been criticized for her race, gender and parental status — but also for laughing. As if an infectious, energizing belly laugh — the literal display of joy — is a bad thing. Walz is also a joyful guy. His former students love him. He was a popular and successful high school football coach. He made “weird” happen. He’s a Midwesterner with “big dad energy” who will offer tips on how to fix your car and save money to boot. Some of you may be familiar with the “beer question” in U.S. politics: a thought experiment often utilized by the media or in polling, which says voters will generally elect the candidate they would rather have a beer with. Victory in American politics often goes not to the candidate who better articulates their platform, but rather, to whoever is more likable. So you be the judge: Who would you rather have a beer with? Harris, who dares to laugh and Walz, the plain-spoken fun uncle who will defend the people he loves? Or Trump, who rambles about sharks and hatred, who makes fun of people and smirks but who rarely laughs, and who doesn’t seem capable of talking to a child — even his own grandkids? And his cat lady-hating sidekick Sen. JD Vance? That guy is really weird. So weird the couch meme won’t die. Vance is basically stalking the Democratic ticket. On Wednesday, he stunned reporters by attempting to confront Harris and Walz on the tarmac when their planes arrived in Wisconsin at similar times.  Vance told reporters he “just wanted to check out [his] future plane.” Walking up to the vice president and Air Force Two is not a thing that normal people do. His weirdness aside, this race has also been a total reversal of how the parties are normally framed. The Republicans love to attack Democratic elites — but this time around, Harris and Walz actually feel like the more regular, normal middle-class folks. Yes, they are living extraordinary political lives but due to hard work, not connections or riches.  Harris went to Howard University, an HBCU, then The University Of California, Hastings College Of Law. Walz attended an open-admissions teachers college in northwest Nebraska. Quite the opposite of the candidates on the Republican side — with Trump-Vance being the Ivy League ticket, loved by the billionaires. It’s a conundrum for the Republican Party. The so-called populist MAGA movement is now bankrolling a celebrity who inherited his wealth, who is not out there campaigning but instead golfing at this exclusive ritzy resort, and a vice presidential candidate anointed by another super weird guy, tech investor Peter Thiel. It’s also a ticket backed by billionaire tech bros who want to unleash Project 2025 — the brainchild of rich people — on the American people.  It is a hateful vision that all people should fear … and it’s a vision reflected perfectly by the two men who want to execute it.

109,"On Harris’ racial identity, Trump apparently can’t help himself",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 09:43:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-racial-identity-trump-apparently-cant-help-rcna165982,"Donald Trump spent much of last week taking aim at Kamala Harris’ racial identity — up to and including the Republican promoting messages related to the Democrat’s birth certificate. The tactics were as racist as they were familiar: Axios described the effort as “Trump’s new birtherism.” Earlier this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who became a sycophantic ally, appeared on Fox News and suggested the party steer clear of comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage ... is a good day for her and a bad day for us,” the South Carolina Republican said. Putting aside the fact that it’s a bad sign when a senator has to publicly appeal to his party’s presidential nominee to be less racist, Graham’s advice appeared sensible. Even Trump’s allies struggled to explain why, exactly, the GOP nominee was investing so much energy into targeting Harris on racial grounds. The former president nevertheless ignored Graham’s recommendation. The New Republic highlighted one of the more memorable exchanges from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago news conference: When a reporter, referencing one of Trump’s comments from last week, specifically asked the former president how it is that Harris only recently decided to be Black, the GOP nominee replied, “You’ll have to ask her that question because she’s the one that said it. I didn’t say it.” As part of the same exchange, Trump went on to argue: “From her standpoint, I think it’s very disrespectful to both, really. Whether it’s Indian or Black, I think it’s very disrespectful to both.” So, a few things. First, the idea that he “didn’t say” that Harris recently decided to be Black is the opposite of the truth. Appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention last week, Trump said — out loud, on the record and on camera — “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” He added, “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Is she Indian, or is she Black?” Second, the idea that a biracial person is being “disrespectful” by honoring their mother’s and father’s heritage is every bit as offensive as it seems. Finally, spare a thought for the Trump sycophants who’ve tried and failed to defend the former president’s fixation on Harris’ race — Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, I’m looking in your direction — only to have the GOP nominee casually stroll back into the racist trap of his own making."
110,"In the debate over the debates, Trump blinks under pressure",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 08:21:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/debate-debates-trump-blinks-pressure-rcna165960,"As recently as a week ago, Donald Trump and his team had made a categorical decision: The Republican would not participate in a Sept. 10 presidential debate to be hosted on ABC. Team Trump had originally agreed to participate in the event, but as of seven days ago, the GOP nominee and his political operation had changed their minds. In fact, they presented a relatively detailed case explaining their decision to back away from the original commitment, citing Trump’s ongoing litigation against ABC and network anchor George Stephanopoulos, which dovetailed with the former president’s incessant whining — online and in conservative media interviews — about the network. Trump instead said he would only agree to debate on Fox News — at a time of his choosing, in a location of his choosing, and with the kind of in-venue audience that makes him happy. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping when President Joe Biden was still running, the Republican posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” And then he blinked. The Associated Press reported: In other words, over the course of a few months, Team Trump agreed to the ABC debate, then backed out of the ABC debate, then caved under pressure and re-agreed to the ABC debate. In the process, the former president also expressed interest in two other debates — not including a possible event for the vice presidential candidates — though during his news conference he flubbed the dates while pointing to debates that haven’t yet been negotiated and might not occur. As for why, exactly, Trump spent weeks backing away from sharing a stage with Harris, only to have a sudden change of heart, I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s thinking, but it’s hard not to notice the parallels between the GOP nominee’s thinking this week and Biden’s thinking months ago: The incumbent wanted to shake up the 2024 race, so he agreed to debate his rival. Months later, it’s Trump who suddenly feels the need to shake up the campaign, so he agreed to reverse course on debating his rival. The Republican declared at his Mar-a-Lago news conference, “I haven’t recalibrated strategy at all.” His debate strategy suggests otherwise."
111,Trump doesn’t recall Jan. 6 and the transition of power as well as he should,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 07:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-doesnt-recall-jan-6-transition-power-well-rcna165950,"No human being should care as much about crowd sizes as Donald Trump, who has spent years obsessing over how many people show up to hear him talk. Lately, however, it’s been worse — not just because of the former president’s narcissism, but also because some impressive audiences have started showing up to Kamala Harris’ rallies. It’s apparently driving the Republican nominee a little batty. At his long, rambling Mar-a-Lago news conference, for example, after a reporter brought up the Democrat’s crowds, a visibly displeased Trump said his crowds are up to “30 times” larger than Harris’. The arithmetic reinforced just how unintentionally amusing the misplaced boast was: The public is apparently supposed to believe that if 10,000 people show up for a Harris event, it might seem impressive, but not when compared with the 300,000 imaginary people who’ve shown up for a Trump event. Of particular interest to the GOP candidate, however, was the crowd on hand to hear his Jan. 6 lies ahead of the assault on the U.S. Capitol. After going on and on for a while about how impressed he was with his Jan. 6 audience — he has insisted repeatedly in recent years that the crowd size that day is what really matters — Trump apparently thought it’d be a good idea to draw a comparison to a major historical event. “If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours — same real estate, same everything — same number of people. If not, we had more,” the former president said at his news conference. “And they said he had a million people but I had 25,000 people.” He chuckled. “But when you look at the exact same picture and everything’s the same because it was — the fountains, the whole thing all the way back to, from Lincoln to Washington, and you look at it and you look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd — we actually had more people.” None of this was even remotely true. Trump apparently didn’t care. What’s more, as part of the same set of remarks, the former president added: “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6.” That wasn’t true, either. But perhaps the most striking lie was Trump’s comments on the transfer of power. The Associated Press reported: It’d be great if that were true. It wasn’t. Not only did an insurrectionist mob, fueled by Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, attack the Capitol two weeks before Inauguration Day, but as the defeated Republican grudgingly exited the White House — refusing to attend his successor’s swearing-in — military personnel and police officers patrolled the streets of Washington, fearing additional potential violence from Trump’s followers. I’m reminded of remarks former Rep. Liz Cheney delivered in June 2022, as the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee began its public hearings, and the Wyoming Republican made an appeal to the public. “Remember the men and women who have fought and died so that we can live under the rule of law, not the rule of men,” Cheney said. “I ask you to think of the scene in our Capitol rotunda on the night of Jan. 6. There, in, a sacred space in our constitutional republic, the place where our presidents lie in state, watched over by statues of Washington and Jefferson, Lincoln and Grant, Eisenhower, Ford and Reagan, against every wall that night encircling the room, there were SWAT teams, men and women in tactical gear with long guns deployed inside our Capitol building. “There in the rotunda, these brave men and women rested beneath paintings depicting the earliest scenes of our Republic, including one painted in 1824 depicting George Washington resigning his commission, voluntarily relinquishing power, handing control of the Continental Army back to Congress. With this noble act, Washington set the indispensable example of the peaceful transfer of power. What President Reagan called, ‘nothing less than a miracle.’ The sacred obligation to defend this peaceful transfer of power has been honored by every American president — except one.”"
112,"On Biden’s retirement, Trump flubs meaning of ‘unconstitutional’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 06:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joe-biden-retirement-trump-flubs-unconstitutional-election-2024-rcna165935,"The first sign of trouble came last week. Donald Trump, complaining about President Joe Biden’s retirement, argued by way of his social media platform that Democrats were “Unconstitutionally” nominating someone new for the party’s 2024 ballot. On Tuesday, the Republican repeated the line, arguing that Democratic Party leaders “Unconstitutionally” took the incumbent’s candidacy away from him. (Why Trump capitalizes the word unnecessarily is unclear, though he’s long adopted his own idiosyncratic approach to grammatical rules.) At his long, rambling Mar-a-Lago press conference, the GOP nominee returned to the subject, suggesting that Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 nomination is, you guessed it, “unconstitutional.” After claiming that Harris was secretly in league with a Democratic cabal that pushed Biden to end his candidacy — an assertion he made up out of whole cloth — Trump said: It’s difficult to say from a distance whether Trump was genuinely confused about recent events or was simply hoping to deceive the public, but he was combining events from two different election cycles. His argument, in effect, was that Harris shouldn’t be the Democratic nominee in 2024 because her 2020 candidacy fell far short, which is every bit as absurd as it seems. But it was his use of the word “unconstitutional” that stood out. Whether the former president realizes this or not, the U.S. Constitution is silent on the matter of party nomination processes. Biden was free to retire voluntarily; he was free to endorse his vice president as his successor; Harris was free to seek her party’s nomination; and Democrats were free to choose her to lead the party’s ticket. Not only were these events in line with federal election law, the idea that the U.S. Constitution somehow prohibits the developments is ridiculous. Trump was nevertheless proud of the comments and promoted a video of his comments on his online platform. Or put another way, instead of being embarrassed by talking about constitutional law in an incoherent way, the Republican seemed eager to flaunt his ignorance. Making matters worse, there’s a larger pattern to consider. In 2019, Trump didn’t like the U.S. House’s impeachment process, so he labeled it “unconstitutional.” In 2023, Trump condemned automatic voter registration, so he labeled it “unconstitutional,” too. Around the same time, the former president said court-imposed gag orders on criminal suspects were “unconstitutional,” and the FBI executing a court-approved search warrant at his glorified country club was “unconstitutional,” too. What voters are confronting, in other words, is a politician who appears to have convinced himself that “unconstitutional” and “stuff that bothers me” are synonymous. They’re not."
113,"On targeting Hillary Clinton, Trump isn’t done rewriting history",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-hillary-clinton-trump-isnt-done-rewriting-history-rcna165924,"The list of lies Donald Trump told during his long and meandering Mar-a-Lago press conference isn’t short, but NBC News highlighted one of the most striking: the former president’s rhetoric about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As part of the same remarks, the Republican nominee said Clinton — who, as a former senator and Cabinet secretary, was more than simply the wife of a former president — was “pretty evil,” but in Trump’s version of events, he nevertheless responded to “lock her up” chants by telling his followers, “Just relax, please. We won the election.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that it was rather creepy to hear Trump declare that he could have “done things” to Clinton “that would have made your head spin.” Instead, let’s consider the underlying point of the rhetoric. The subject is on my mind in part because I talk about this in my new book — which comes out in just a few days — but Trump is rewriting history with a specific goal in mind. In the GOP candidate’s counternarrative, he was “very protective” of his 2016 rival after the election, in part because of his deep commitment to propriety, and in part because he believed it was wrong to use the levers of governmental power to pursue a political rival. As part of the same story — a counternarrative he’s pushed before — voters are also supposed to believe that those rascally Democrats, however, abandoned these principles and prosecuted him after his 2020 defeat, failing to follow the magnanimous example he established a few years earlier. There’s just one fairly obvious problem: Trump’s version of reality is utterly bonkers. As regular readers know, Trump publicly and privately begged prosecutors to charge Clinton. Ahead of Election Day 2020 — nearly four years after Clinton’s defeat — the then-Republican president again publicly called for the Democrat’s incarceration and lobbied then-Attorney General Barr to prosecute the former secretary of state for reasons unknown. None of this was kept secret. It happened out in the open. We all saw it play out in public — all of which makes it a strange thing for the GOP presidential nominee to keep lying about. As for the idea that Trump was uncomfortable with his followers’ “lock her up” chants, and he graciously told them to “just relax,” reality tells a very different story. He not only spent four years in the White House trying to prosecute Clinton — the opposite of “relaxing” — a recent Washington Post report noted, there are ""several instances in which Trump called explicitly for Clinton’s jailing and others in which he agreed with his supporters’ chants.” What’s more, it’s also worth emphasizing for context that Clinton didn’t deserve to be prosecuted, because there was no evidence of her committing any crimes. A jury, on the other hand, recently examined evidence and found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. To be sure, I understand why the former president is trying to rewrite history. Trump now wants the public to believe he took the high road against his former rivals, unlike those Democratic meanies who insist on holding him accountable. In reality, however, Trump desperately tried to weaponize federal law enforcement against his perceived foes — especially Clinton. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
114,Donald Trump is struggling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-09 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-news-conference-kamabla-harris-rcna165636,"Former President Donald Trump is struggling. It’s been evident for weeks now. The glow hadn’t yet faded on his triumphant performance at the Republican National Convention when President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Since then, Trump has had to face a resurgent opponent with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. And, friends, let me tell you, he is not happy about it. Most infuriating to Trump is his campaign being in a position it has rarely been in: chasing the spotlight. Rather than setting the media’s agenda every day, he’s been forced to watch as Harris has sucked up all the oxygen in the room. The horrible rollout of his own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has only highlighted how energized Democratic voters have become. Worst of all for Trump, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have been drawing massive crowds, a fact that had Trump fuming at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday. Trump hasn’t been doing himself many favors in this post-Biden campaign. While Harris and Walz are crisscrossing six swing states introducing themselves this week, Trump is mostly off the campaign trail. His sudden decision to hold a press event was a clear attempt to draw the focus back to himself, an attempt that will likely prove to be less effective than it’s been in the past. The problem is that Trump and his campaign spent the last several years preparing to run against Biden and are having difficulty shifting gears, despite having reportedly laid some groundwork to face Harris ahead of the swap. This new reality hasn’t set well with Trump at all, who complained (incorrectly) at his news conference that it’s unconstitutional for Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. It appears that, without Biden as a foil, candidate Trump no longer knows who he is. In a sign that everything is totally cool and normal with him, Trump launched into a bit of Biden fanfiction on TruthSocial earlier this week, speculating that the president might try to seize back the nomination at the Democratic National Convention this month. It doesn’t help that the Trump campaign hasn’t landed on an effective message to deploy against Harris beyond the boilerplate anti-Democrat language that typifies the Trump era. (Soft on crime, bad on the border, secretly a communist — you know the drill.) Without a firm strategy in place, we see Trump trying to find something — anything — that works. In the truest to form example, his attack against Harris’ mixed-race background during his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week was reportedly unplanned — and has already fizzled out as a talking point. In his desperation, Trump has also been cycling through potential nicknames for Harris, trying out “Laffin’ Kamala” and “Crazy Kamala” before landing on the baffling choice of “Kamabla.” It’s a choice that’s confusing and unlikely to have any impact on the perception of Harris. It could be a racist dog whistle; it could be a play on the word “blah” to imply that she’s boring; it may be both or neither. (Anyone else old enough to remember former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., clarifying he was talking about “blah” people on welfare, not “Black” people, in a speech?) Trump's outbursts have prompted his staff to run with the ball, like when they threw up projections at a subsequent rally that highlighted Harris’ Indian heritage. The same is true for “Kamabla,” despite it being objective nonsense. HuffPost reporter S.V. Dáte hit up a senior campaign official to ask what it means, the staffer repeatedly only responded with “Kamabla.” See also: This entirely unhelpful X post from Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung: Embracing “Kamabla” is likely to be more about hoping the base joins in on the evident trolling of the libs than any real understanding of what the heck Trump really means. But it’s clearly far from what the campaign and Trump’s closest surrogates wanted him to be doing. As The New York Times put it, “many in Mr. Trump’s party find this all to be counterproductive, to say the least.” It’s a situation that ironically has him “asking friends and allies how his campaign staff is doing — a question that some say could lead to staff changes,” The Washington Post reported. But if we’re being honest, his inability to be anyone other than himself, no matter how much it would benefit him, is a given at this point. Same with the affinity for pithy nicknames thing — it’s something that we’ve come to expect from Trump. These things are baked into his political persona by now, and we’re seeing a repeat of the same old shtick he’s been performing since 2016. In other words, what we’re seeing is Trump hunkering down in his comfort zone, returning to the tricks that have become tropes. It’s wild to realize that what was once shocking from him has become rote, pedestrian even. It’s a feeling that Sid Blumenthal captured in The Guardian when he compared Trump to Laurence Olivier’s character in “The Entertainer,” a man “desperately trying to float his act, shamelessly manipulating and trampling everybody, but incapable of performing anything but the old numbers before a bored audience.” That already threatened to be the case back in 2020, when I noted that Trump was trying to make a shot-by-shot remake of his first campaign. Four years later, he was hoping to try to do the exact same before Harris completely upended that plan. Now, having been denied the rematch that he wanted, Trump is the only one left feeling stale."
115,Trump and his allies are previewing their election sabotage plan in Georgia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 16:08:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/georgia-election-board-trump-certification-rcna165784,"Obscure, unelected state government panels aren’t usually a hot election topic. But the Georgia State Election Board has drawn well-deserved national attention with its outrageous actions on Tuesday to pass antidemocratic changes to the battleground state’s election rules. It has provided fodder for Donald Trump, earning sharply partisan praise at his recent Atlanta rally. Now Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp should reverse its rogue actions.  The board used to be a sleepy bipartisan backwater that kept well away from controversy. But earlier this year, the GOP-controlled state Legislature appointed two new members to the five-person panel, transforming it into a Trump-aligned government body. Three of the board’s five members have expressed doubts that President Joe Biden won the state in the 2020 election. The board’s meetings have become a haven for false election conspiracy theories, many based on Trump’s 2020 election lies. Now the board’s MAGA majority is trying to change Georgia’s election rules just ahead of the contest. Its first attempt came last month, only to be reversed after a lawsuit accused the three members of holding an unlawful meeting to ram through the changes. This week, though, they resumed their headlong charge for the Republican nominee.  One of the two new rules passed by the board on Tuesday lets local elections officials halt vote-counting and delay or even outright refuse certification if they contend there are any irregularities, essentially making the certification of election results discretionary. (Georgia law states in multiple places that local election board officials shall perform their duties — meaning their duties are mandatory, not discretionary). Other proposed changes would increase workload demands on overburdened election workers, which could overwhelm county elections offices and ultimately slow down or stop certification. These eleventh-hour changes are supported by Republican Party officials, GOP operatives at the Republican National Committee and MAGA-connected ""election integrity"" activists. These include local elections officials and GOP officials who most likely believe Trump was cheated out of the 2020 election. And all this builds on similar efforts in 2020, when a Coffee County elections official delayed certification of Biden’s Georgia victory and refused to validate the recount results, citing MAGA-backed election conspiracies. The same official allegedly helped Trump campaign operatives breach Coffee County’s voting data days before Jan. 6. According to CNN, Coffee County was specifically cited in draft federal executive orders for seizing voting machines that were presented to Trump in a chaotic Oval Office meeting on Dec. 18, 2020. In the same meeting, Rudy Giuliani alluded to a plan to gain “voluntary access” to Georgia voting machines. The foundation for obstructing certification of the 2024 election results is being laid in Georgia. These newly passed rules changes, along with other proposed changes still being considered by the board, follow refusals from Republican county election board members in Georgia to certify election results in the 2023 local elections and the 2024 primary even though there is no legitimate doubts about the results. And it doesn’t stop there. After Fulton County’s 2024 primary, Fulton County Election Board member Julie Adams filed a suit challenging a badly needed law that prevents local officials from refusing certification. Adams is represented by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute and belongs to the Election Integrity Network, whose founder, Cleta Mitchell, joined Trump’s infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump’s 2020 election interference playbook hasn’t changed, but the MAGA operation has become more sophisticated. Now, there are election deniers holding local elections positions in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania (in addition to Georgia). GOP officials have resisted certifying results in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada.  But Georgia elections are facing an attack from Trump’s operation that seems more intense than any of its other efforts across the country. The state’s current lieutenant governor signed a certificate saying Trump won Georgia in 2020 and certifying himself as a false elector. After failing to overturn his 2020 loss, it seems Trump aims to win Georgia by any means, aided by the State Election Board. Trump may be hinting at this strategy, recently claiming he “didn’t need the votes,” an odd statement for a presidential candidate. Trump’s remarks could be a hint to the re-use of his operation’s 2020 playbook, only better planned and executed. The person best positioned to stop this is Gov. Brian Kemp. Though Kemp has continued to sign voter suppression bills inspired by Trump’s “big lie” into law, he received bipartisan praise for refusing to go along with Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Will Kemp step up again to defend Georgia’s elections from MAGA sabotage? Or will he continue to egg them on as he has in the past couple of Georgia’s legislative sessions?  Georgia law gives Kemp the authority to investigate members of the election board and remove and replace them if they’ve violated Georgia law, which it certainly seems they did by holding an unlawful meeting. Even though Kemp supports Trump’s run for president, he should agree: Trump must win Georgians’ votes fair and square. But the response doesn’t stop with the governor, of course. Others have an important role to play, as well. In the last presidential cycle, pro-democracy activists like Georgia’s Fair Fight (for which one of the co-authors, Groh-Wargo, serves as CEO) built voter protection operations in every crucial battleground state, exposed Trump’s callous voter suppression scheme and helped turn out the vote in 2020 that secured Biden’s Georgia win and delivered control of the U.S. Senate for Democrats. The pro-democracy ecosystem is once again working to protect voters’ ability to stay on the rolls, access the ballot, vote and have their votes counted in 2024. Voters are the last and ultimately most critical line of defense. The best way to ensure election results are certified in a timely manner is with large turnout and decisive margins. Voters everywhere should also check their voter registration status regularly and get their friends and family registered today. It’s also not too early to make a plan to vote, sign up to be a poll worker in your community or get involved with your state Democratic Party’s voter protection team. If we exercise our freedom to vote, we can stop the MAGA election sabotage scheme."
116,Pro-Trump Republicans should think twice about ridiculing ‘Tampon Tim’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 15:15:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tampon-tim-walz-social-media-trump-team-rcna165810,"When I first saw the hashtag #TamponTim circulating on social media, I was excited. What high praise, I thought. As someone who has worked in menstrual equity for the past 15 years, I was grateful that Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was receiving recognition for the significant steps he’s taken to support menstrual equity, including eliminating the tampon tax and ensuring that free menstrual products are available in all public school bathrooms in Minnesota. The nickname, of course, was intended as a slight — spurred by fans of the Trump/Vance ticket as an attempt to ridicule men for standing up for women’s rights and menstrual equity and specifically to contort and promote the hypermasculine message coming from the GOP. But the truth is Gov. Walz’s actions are not just commendable; they are groundbreaking. By removing the tampon tax, he made Minnesota one of the few states to recognize the absurdity of taxing essential health products. Currently, 21 states still impose tampon taxes. The average menstruator spends about $13.25 per month on menstrual products, which amounts to over $6,000 in a lifetime. Eliminating the tampon tax can significantly reduce this financial burden and improve economic inequalities. Walz’s administration also implemented policies ensuring that menstrual products are freely available in public school bathrooms. This move is crucial for students who might experience their first periods unexpectedly or who cannot afford products at home. According to a 2019 study by Plan International USA, 1 in 5 girls in the U.S. has missed school because of lack of access to menstrual products. Period poverty is a real issue in the U.S. Providing free products in schools can help mitigate this issue.  Leaders who acknowledge these issues also help destigmatize menstruation and prevent shame and embarrassment for something that is so natural. These actions demonstrate a genuine commitment to supporting the well-being and dignity of all people who menstruate.  Walz’s push to put menstrual products in all gendered bathrooms is where this amusing, supposedly derogatory, nickname came from. But I really think the name should be embraced and celebrated. Walz’s progressive policies stand in stark contrast to the wave of regressive legislation sweeping across the U.S. Laws like Florida’s “Don’t Say Period” bill, which restricts discussions about menstruation in schools for students under 12, are a blatant attack on freedom and on speech, and are detrimental to the health and dignity of our young people — regardless of whether they bleed or not. In other states, there are moves to subpoena menstrual data, which has the potential to be weaponized against people in states where abortion access is restricted. These laws are not just invasive; they are dangerous. In 2022, Missouri and Florida lawmakers proposed bills to require the tracking of menstrual cycles for minors, raising significant concerns about the potential misuse of such data in states with restrictive abortion laws. Even though the bills have not passed, the initiatives behind them highlight the dangers of overregulating menstruation, which exacerbates a culture of shame and silence around menstruation. Such practices can have serious health and social consequences, underscoring the need for careful consideration of privacy and ethical implications. Unfortunately, periods have been used as a political football in other political fights. Specifically, the anti-trans, anti-abortion, anti-sex education and pro-religion-in-schools groups, which continually use the policing of periods as means to other ends. As a consequence, today there are more laws regulating periods in America than in other countries, highlighting a troubling trend. Walz is a rare example of a politician willing to take a stand for menstrual equity, and we need more like him. The current landscape of laws targeting menstruation is not just absurd; it is alarming.  For the past 15 years, the Desai Foundation, the programmatic nongovernmental organization that I run, has been working in menstrual equity across India and has seen firsthand the consequences of ignorance, debilitating stigmas, limited access to products and other aspects of menstrual equity that lead to impacts on health, reproductive health, education, economic empowerment and beyond.  It’s crucial to build a coalition of policymakers across the U.S. who understand that menstrual equity is a matter of basic human rights. As we look toward future elections, it is essential to remember that bleeders are voters. And there are a lot of them. Politicians who advocate for menstrual equity are likely to gain support from voters who prioritize health, gender equality and reproductive rights.  A 2021 survey by YouGov found that 60% of Americans support eliminating the tampon tax. Think about how that could translate to voters in a presidential election. There is widespread public support for policies that promote menstrual equity; we just need to talk about them more. Let’s encourage more of our representatives to earn nicknames like #TamponTim by supporting initiatives that make real differences in people’s lives and advance menstrual equity."
117,Packed Harris-Walz campaign rallies likely to rattle crowd-size-obsessed Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 13:51:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/trump-vance-harris-walz-crowd-size-rcna165823,"This is an adapted excerpt of the Aug. 8 episode of ""Morning Joe."" The recent attacks from Republicans targeting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military career are just a small part of a much larger theme within the Trump-Vance campaign — a campaign that feasts on dishonesty and disinformation.  They do that to deflect from a record where the cruelty, the violence, the antidemocratic values, the disrespect for our Constitution is the entire point. That’s who they are and that’s what they want to distract from. And to do so, they are trying to tear two very positive, joyful and energetic people down.  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are riding a high right now. Their best strategy is just to keep moving forward and deflect the disinformation that comes their way. But they also need to embrace the joy — which you see them doing.  Just look at the crowds they’re attracting. There has been a burst of energy and enthusiasm. You have people waiting out in the hot sun for hours. When you have to move a rally to an airport hangar, and that’s not even big enough, you’re onto something. Harris isn’t on a roll just with her vice presidential pick, it’s her entire campaign. We know Donald Trump depends on crowd size for his own sense of value. We saw that from his very first event as president, his inauguration, where he had to lie about it. Clearly crowd size is very important to the former president, so what we’re seeing from Harris and Walz will, no doubt, be very scary to the Trump campaign moving forward. And it doesn’t look like their crowds will be getting smaller anytime soon."
118,Trump’s ‘drill baby drill’ plan: The wrong answer to the right questions,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 09:55:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-drill-baby-drill-plan-wrong-answer-right-questions-rcna165805,"A few months ago, after a monthly unemployment report reached the public, a reporter asked Donald Trump about his jobs plan. “My plan for jobs is to drill baby drill, bring energy down,” the former president replied. That didn’t make any sense — oil drilling does not have a meaningful impact on unemployment — but the Republican didn’t seem to care. The exchange came to mind anew during Trump’s latest Fox News appearance. HuffPost reported on a question the GOP candidate heard from a voter at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota. After initially mentioning how popular he believes he is among those at the event, the next words out of Trump’s mouth were, “We are going to drill baby drill; we’re going to bring down the cost of energy. Energy’s what caused the worst inflation, I think, in the history of our country.” The comments were widely derided, and for good reason: Trump heard a good question, and he responded with a nonsensical answer. Right off the bat, it’s worth emphasizing that while recent inflation rates imposed a real burden on millions of Americans, the problem wasn’t close to being the worst inflation in American history. What’s more, the former president’s indifference to the substance of governing is the stuff of legend — it was the basis for much of my first book — and his latest rhetoric doesn’t help matters. Asked about his jobs plan, Trump pointed to oil drilling. Asked about housing affordability, Trump again pointed to oil drilling. It seems like only a matter of time before he starts saying “drill baby drill” in response to questions about health care and education, too. I realize the GOP nominee isn’t literally going to say, “I don’t have an actual policy agenda,” but he’s implicitly making that point clear. But perhaps most important of all is Trump’s apparent ignorance about the status quo when it comes to energy policy: We’re already drilling. In fact, the United States during the Biden-Harris administration has not only produced more energy than any other country on the planet, energy production in the United States under Biden-Harris has also reached an all-time high. And it’s not just oil. U.S. production of natural gas, solar, wind generation, and battery storage have also all reached record highs under the incumbent Democratic administration. The country, in other words, is already doing the one thing Trump sees as the magical solution to domestic challenges, leaving us with a straightforward question: Does he not know the truth, or is he counting on voters not to know the truth?"
119,"Flunking self-awareness again, Trump bemoans ‘Pro Criminal Atmosphere’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 08:23:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/flunking-self-awareness-trump-bemoans-criminal-atmosphere-rcna165785,"After Gov. Tim Walz joined the Democrats’ 2024 ticket this week, Donald Trump’s campaign team wasted little time in targeting the Minnesotan with attacks that appeared pre-packaged. One part of the offensive, however, stood out. Walz, Team Trump told voters, has a record of “embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.” Putting aside the fact that the governor did, in fact, restore voting rights for formerly incarcerated people — a popular and just position — the line of attack flunked a rather obvious test of self-awareness: A jury recently found the former president guilty of 34 felonies. The press release from Team Trump was intended to make it seem as if Walz has somehow been soft on criminals, which might’ve been more sensible if Trump weren’t already a criminal. Thursday morning — just two days after extensive coverage of his campaign’s misstep on Monday — the former president made the same self-defeating mistake. In a message published to his social media platform, Trump wrote: This was not an isolated comment. The GOP candidate recently declared with confidence at a public event, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” the Republican nominee said. “They generally stay a criminal, and we do not have time to figure it out.” This need not be complicated. A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. He's also still facing several dozen other pending felony counts, across multiple jurisdictions. If it's effectively impossible to “teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” he should probably drop out of the 2024 race immediately. What’s more, the former president has also surrounded himself with other criminals. “With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley recently noted. “With Trump, you have a team of felons.” In case that weren’t quite enough, during his failed presidency, Trump had a habit of issuing scandalous pardons to politically aligned criminals, and if elected to a second term, the Republican has promised to issue even more pardons to politically aligned criminals — including those who violently clashed with police officers. If Trump is looking for evidence of an actual “pro-criminal atmosphere,” he can actually find one in his own political operation. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
120,"Trump, Vance pick a fight over antisemitism they can’t win",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-08 07:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-pick-fight-antisemitism-cant-win-rcna165767,"Almost immediately after Vice President Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Donald Trump thought it’d be a good idea to falsely accuse her of antisemitism. Harris, the Republican said, is “totally against the Jewish people” — which was a curious claim about someone with a Jewish husband. But this week, the ugly offensive managed to get considerably worse. Before Harris announced her 2024 running mate, GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance said that if the Democrat didn’t choose Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, it would be “out of antisemitism.” After Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the ticket, the Republicans’ antisemitism smear reached new heights. If the vice president seriously considered a Jewish running mate before ultimately settling on one of his rivals, the right argued, then clearly Harris and her party have a problem with Jews. When Vance was asked if he had any evidence to support the idea that Harris is antisemitic, the Ohio Republican responded by complaining about the question — which he didn’t get around to answering. Nevertheless, around the same time, Trump appeared on Fox and suggested that Shapiro was passed over for the Democratic ticket “because of the fact that he’s Jewish.” All of this is so utterly bonkers, it’s difficult to know where to start, but let’s review a handful of relevant data points. The idea that Democrats are antisemites, denying political opportunities and leadership positions to Jews, is obviously not to be taken seriously. But making matters considerably worse are some of the other relevant details from recent years. Trump, for example, continues to peddle antisemitic tropes as a matter of course. He also hung out with some notorious antisemites at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. All of which is to say, Republicans might see value in picking this fight, but it’s not one they should expect to win."

Tim Walz made his public introduction as his party’s vice presidential candidate this week, the Minnesota Democrat turned his attention to possibly sharing a stage with Sen. JD Vance. “I can’t wait to debate the guy — that is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,” Walz said. Putting aside the governor’s crude subtext, the comments helped spark renewed interest in a possible showdown: Donald Trump appears to be afraid of Vice President Kamala Harris, but will Vance agree to debate Walz? The Ohio Republican fielded a question on this on Wednesday, but as a report in The New Republic noted, his answer wasn’t altogether helpful. As part of the same answer, Vance, in apparent seriousness, said Harris doesn’t yet know whether she’ll be her party’s presidential nominee, adding, “[W]e don’t know who the vice presidential nominee is going to be, either.” The Republican concluded that Democrats might yet “pull a bait and switch” and dump Walz from the ticket, which is why, Vance added, he’s “all game” to hold a vice presidential debate with Harris next week. In other words, those hoping to watch a Walz/Vance debate should probably start lowering their expectations. As for the top of the parties’ respective tickets, the GOP presidential nominee shared some new rhetoric on the subject during his latest Fox News interview. The New York Times reported: Trump concluded, “Look, she doesn’t want to debate.” It’s not the first time the former president, who obviously doesn’t want to debate, has engaged in projection, and it probably won’t be the last."
122,Why Trump hasn't been charged in the Arizona 2020 fake electors case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 13:43:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fake-electors-arizona-2020-rcna165584,"Why wasn’t Donald Trump charged in Arizona’s 2020 election-related prosecution? When the indictment came down in April, I noted some possible reasons while emphasizing that “we don’t know exactly what happened in the grand jury and what grand jurors thought of any potential charges against the former president.” We now have some insight into the state of grand jurors’ thinking: Apparently, they were interested in charging the former president. But the state wasn’t.   That revelation comes in a court filing by state prosecutors this week. Responding to the defense claim that the charges are politically biased, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes’ office noted that it asked the grand jury not to charge several Republicans, including Trump. Explaining why, the prosecution cited the U.S. Justice Department’s policy regarding overlapping charges by federal and state prosecutors. The filing excerpted the following remarks by a prosecutor to the grand jury: So, what is this DOJ policy, exactly? Known as the “Petite Policy,” it “establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion by appropriate officers of the Department of Justice in determining whether to bring a federal prosecution based on substantially the same act(s) or transactions involved in a prior state or federal proceeding.” Notably, that’s not the situation here. That is, it’s not a question of a federal prosecution following a prior state or federal one, but rather a state prosecution following a federal one. And of course, this is guidance for federal prosecutors, not for state prosecutors generally (or Arizona in particular), though it instructs federal prosecutors to consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests involved, and, if possible, to resolve all criminal liability for the acts in question.” And while Trump has been charged federally by special counsel Jack Smith, he was also charged in the related state case in Georgia. Clearly, federal policy didn’t prevent Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from bringing that indictment. The fate of both of those cases is uncertain, however, due to the Supreme Court immunity ruling’s possible implications for both prosecutions and, when it comes to the Georgia case, the pending pretrial defense challenge to disqualify Willis. Just because Trump hasn’t been charged in Arizona doesn’t mean he won’t ever be. If he becomes president again, he’ll gain the power to crush his federal election interference case. To the extent that the existence of that federal case is what’s holding Arizona prosecutors back, its disappearance could change their calculus — though, in the hypothetical scenario in which Trump is re-elected, any prosecution proceeding against him would likely have to wait until he was out of office again to get going. For now, though, as to why Trump wasn’t initially charged in Arizona, it wasn’t for lack of interest on the grand jury’s part.

123,Georgia’s elections board just made it easier for Trump loyalists to delay the certification of votes,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 13:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/georgia-election-board-trump-loyalists-votes-rcna165583,"On Tuesday, a Republican majority on Georgia’s State Election Board voted to change the process for certifying election results in a way that could allow Trump-supporting election deniers in key positions to dubiously cause delays. The three members who voted for the change had been praised by Donald Trump by name at his rally in Atlanta over the weekend. The changes are disturbing — and justifiably being met with outrage — given that Team Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election involved calling for state election officials to delay certification, potentially allowing the Republican-packed Supreme Court to weigh in, or even the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. It didn’t work, but Republicans have since taken control of several powerful positions overseeing local elections in battleground states, which could make a similar scheme more successful this time. Atlanta-based journalist George Chidi summed up Tuesday’s vote well for The Guardian: Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, seemed eager to downplay concerns about the change.  “Georgia’s Election Integrity Act requires counties to certify the election results by November 12th and we fully anticipate that counties will follow the law,” he wrote on X. But whether or not Republicans end up being able to use this particular mechanism to undermine democracy, Raffensperger’s assurance doesn’t change the fact that Georgia Republicans have made moves to enhance their electoral chances — and established avenues to sow chaos and potentially undermine results that don’t break their way. They’ve accomplished this by passing voter suppression laws that have created hurdles for liberal-leaning constituencies — such as Black voters and young voters; mass purges of voter rolls, largely at the behest of right-wing activists; gerrymandering districts to water down Black voters’ electoral power; and, indeed, with votes like the one we saw Tuesday. Republicans have spent years gaslighting Americans about “rigged” elections. Meanwhile, they’ve broadly done everything in their power to tip the scales come November. And Georgia is a prime example."

Even conservatives have been talking about Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz’s rally on Tuesday, remarking how well those two did — and the vibrancy of it all. It’s hope, optimism and joy versus the promise of retribution, anger, bitterness and division. And if you look at the candidates’ schedules, it’s also the active versus the inert. You have Harris flying out of Washington on Wednesday and heading to Wisconsin, doing an event there and then going straight to Detroit. Her schedule is busy morning, noon and night.  Here’s how Donald Trump laid out his schedule for Wednesday: “I will be interviewed tomorrow morning at 7:30 A.M. on Fox & Friends. Much to talk about. ENJOY!” The truth is, whenever Trump does go out he damages his campaign. His campaign has been very straightforward and honest about that. They want to hide him. They want to keep him from going out and talking because we see what happens when he does.  He went to Georgia and basically created a political civil war inside the Georgia Republican Party — making devastating comments, not only about Gov. Brian Kemp, but the governor’s wife, which again, is the last thing he needed to do. It’s clear this is going to be a campaign of contrast."
125,Trump picks a nickname for Harris that no one seems to understand,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 12:12:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-nickname-kamala-harris-kamabla-no-one-understands-rcna165602,"It was late Monday when Donald Trump first referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Kamabla” on his social media platform. Soon after, the former president repeated the nickname. A day later, the Republican wrote it again. And then again. And then again. And then again. At this point, readers might be asking, “What in the world does ‘Kamabla’ actually mean?” That’s certainly a common question this week, and no one seems to know the answer. That includes Team Trump surrogates. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Gov. Doug Burgum last night, “This is something I’m personally curious about. ... Do you know where [‘Kamabla’] came from, and what that nickname means?” The North Dakota Republican replied, “I can’t comment on that.” On Wednesday afternoon, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, was asked the same question. The Ohio Republican chuckled, but he didn’t answer the question. The mystery, in other words, lingers. I’ve seen a wide variety of guesses — the idea that this might be some kind of Three Dog Night reference is especially amusing — and it’s certainly possible that Trump didn’t even mean to call her “Kamabla,” but once he did, he decided to lean into the typo. But there’s also a larger context to all of this. As a New York Times report summarized: This is compelling, and coming up with a weird, gibberish-like nickname might very well have something to do with the GOP nominee’s desire to define Harris as The Other. But the whole point of derisive nicknames is to convey an obvious criticism. When Trump called Sen. Marco Rubio “Little Marco,” the phrase was intended to diminish the Floridian’s stature. When he called Sen. Ted Cruz “Lying Ted,” Trump was trying to draw attention to the Texan’s dishonesty. The meaning and purpose of the nicknames were self-evident. No one thought to wonder why in the world Trump was using these lines. The fact that the former president’s own surrogates can’t explain his sudden fixation on “Kamabla” is a timely reminder of a politician who clearly no longer has his fastball."
126,"Increasingly desperate, Trump wants Biden to return to 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/desperate-donald-trump-wants-joe-biden-return-2024-race-election-rcna165508,"As of a few weeks ago, Donald Trump was feeling quite good about the state of the 2024 presidential race. The former president was ahead in the polls; Democrats were divided; President Joe Biden was struggling; and much of the national analysis was about the expanding electoral map, as traditional “blue” states started to appear more competitive. The Republican had reason to be pleased: He was winning. Indeed, Trump’s assumptions about his inevitable victory contributed to his decision to pick an unpopular far-right running mate: As the GOP nominee saw it, he could get away with adding Sen. JD Vance to the ticket — as opposed to a qualified candidate with broader electoral appeal — because the race was effectively over. That is, until it wasn’t. Biden’s decision to pass the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris has done exactly what many Democrats expected: It overhauled the 2024 contest and put the party in a better position to win. The shift has made Trump increasingly hysterical. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico this week. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” In fact, it’s reached the point at which Trump seems to be trying to coax Biden to re-enter the race and return things to how they were when the former president was still happy. Within a few hours of Harris adding Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to the Democratic ticket, the Republican claimed by way of his social media platform, “I HEAR THERE IS A BIG MOVEMENT TO ‘BRING BACK CROOKED JOE.’” For those who pay close attention to Trump’s rhetoric, “I hear” is one of those things he says when he’s making stuff up. It’s effectively the same thing as manufactured anecdotes about big guys crying while calling him, “Sir.” About a half-hour later, the GOP candidate nevertheless published a follow-up item, pondering the possibility that Biden might “crash” the Democratic National Convention in order to “take back the Nomination.” Trump added: So, a few things. First, if anyone should avoid references to “coups,” it’s Trump. Second, the idea that Trump is privy to Biden’s private thoughts is kind of hilarious. Third, there is literally no reason to believe the incumbent president, who’s already endorsed Harris, has any interest in reversing his retirement decision, and the vice president has already secured the party’s 2024 nomination. But let’s not miss the forest for the trees: To get a sense of the Republican’s current assessment of the 2024 race, look no further than his silly efforts to get Biden to jump back into the contest, and put things back the way they were when he was still happy. A confident candidate, optimistic about the campaign’s direction, wouldn’t push such obvious nonsense. A panicking candidate, however, would. New York’s Jon Chait added, “Many of Trump’s strange public utterances have some animalistic logic to them. Whatever their lack of connection to truth, he displays dominance or caters to the desires of his audience. Here Trump is doing neither. He is fantasizing that the opponent currently tormenting him, and whom he is afraid to debate, will somehow disappear and the opponent he was defeating will somehow return.” Quite right. Whenever he’s in a jam with no obvious solution, one of Trump’s instincts is to look for someone who can make his problem go away. In this instance, he’s settled on, of all people, Biden. It’s rare to see such a pitiful display of desperation."
127,Glenn Youngkin downplays Trump’s mass firing plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 05:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/glenn-youngkin-trump-mass-firing-project-2025-rcna165470,"Polls show Americans are broadly worried, if not disgusted, by the idea of Project 2025, a detailed plan drafted largely by members of Donald Trump’s administration, which would fill the government with Trump loyalists and enforce draconian policies if he’s elected.  Even though the MAGA DNA in Project 2025 is clear, Trump and his campaign have publicly tried to distance themselves from it — a sign of its political toxicity. But one person who’s oddly calm about the potential damage Project 2025 could do to his state? Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. To enact Project 2025, Trump loyalists have discussed reviving an executive order he tried to enact in 2020, known as “Schedule F,” which would have stripped federal civil servants of their protections and allowed Trump to fire people for whatever reason. For the more than 140,000 federal employees who work in Virginia, such a move could have devastating implications.  But Youngkin suggested federal workers in his state would be just fine even if they are purged from their positions for political reasons or if a second Trump administration relocates entire agencies, as Trump did with varying success during his first term. According to WVTF public radio:  In a campaign video this year, Trump said, “As many as 100,000 government positions could be moved out, and I mean immediately, of Washington to places filled with patriots.” But for Youngkin to tell hundreds of thousands of federal employees, many of whom may have been working in their positions for years, that they could easily transition into these “fabulous” jobs sounds beyond naive — if not downright callous. And Virginia Democrats were quick to pounce on Youngkin for the remarks.  Virginia's governor has managed to pitch himself as a centrist and gets portrayed as a rising Republican star. But his remarks here highlight one glaring flaw: Though he can seem genial in person, that persona often feels like a cover for cruel and draconian policies."
128,Trump can’t take a joke. Democrats need to use that.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-07 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jd-vance-tim-walz-weird-maga-authoritarians-rcna164669,"It’s the summer of weird Republicans. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly mentions Hannibal Lecter at his rallies, speaking about the fictional cannibal as though he were a real person. “He’s a lovely man. He’d love to have you for dinner,” must be one of the strangest things a candidate has said while trying to attract votes. Meanwhile, Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has made news with his bizarre opinions, including a 2021 remark that Americans with children should be able to vote more times in an election than their childless compatriots. Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate for president who met with Trump to discuss the possibility of dropping out of the race, admitted to dumping a bear carcass in Central Park a decade ago. (“We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,” he claimed.) “These guys are just weird,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said last week on “Morning Joe.” That label has stuck ever since, to the right’s frustration and fury. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has seized the messaging advantages of “weird,” and on Tuesday she even named Walz to the ticket. For scholars of authoritarianism, the success of “weird” is no surprise. That’s because humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics. Behind the facade of their omnipotence, most strongmen are brittle and insecure personalities. They don’t mind being called evil, but being ridiculed is a different matter. When fringe beliefs become mainstream, it’s easy to accept a political environment where the surreal and the extreme are everyday affairs. That’s how we get to Fox News host Jesse Watters telling viewers that “scientists” believe that “when a man votes for a woman, he actually transitions into a woman.” The misogyny and transgender phobia that may have inspired this proclamation are no joke, but the opportunity for satire at the ridiculous statement should not be missed. Strongmen have their own sadistic sense of humor, which is amply displayed in the awful authoritarian spectacles staged by their governments. The Nazis enjoyed making Communists who entered Dachau concentration camp in 1933, like Hans Beimler, wear signs that said “A hearty welcome!” But they cannot take a joke when they are the targets. That’s why they have to surround themselves with sycophants and lackeys, and their enablers know their prestige must be policed. When a man brought his pet rabbit named Mussolini to a bar in fascist Italy, thinking others would enjoy seeing him order it around, he was quickly arrested and served a year in confinement. Chilean graphic artist Guillo Bastías discovered the price of puncturing the leader’s personality cult with humor when the magazine Apsi published his caricature of dictator Augusto Pinochet as Louis XIV in 1987. The regime sent the magazine’s editors to jail for “extremism”: That’s how threatening humor can be as a truth-telling vehicle, in this case about how Pinochet saw the scope of his power. Satire shifts our perception of things and people, helping us to see them in a new light that is often unflattering to them. And it reminds us that what we are living through is out of the ordinary. As Bastías told me in 2018, he wanted to reassure Chileans suffering under the dictatorship that there were people who were “refusing to accept the disinformation and lies … refusing to accept the abnormal as normal.” And so we are back to “weird” as a strategy of disruption, and how thankful we can be that our democratic rights afford us freedom of speech to level such critiques at the powerful without fear of detention or worse. That is how artist Robin Bell was able to stage his projections on the front of Trump International Hotel, like a May 2017 work that read “Pay Trump Bribes Here.” While Bell worked in very different circumstances than Guillo, he, too, saw his work as a way of reminding people that “what we are experiencing is not normal.” Humor can have a crucial role in the work of mobilization and civic education to keep those democratic rights. “Laughtivism,” as Serbian democracy activist Srdja Popovic has called it, views humor as more effective than anger in highly polarized situations. When we laugh together, fear and distrust lessen, which is the opposite of what authoritarians want. That, too, is why such leaders can’t take a joke. "
129,Trump's initial response to Harris picking Walz is quite telling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 14:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-reaction-harris-walz-vp-pick-rcna165358,"Former President Donald Trump responded to Vice President Kamala Harris' selection of Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday with an uncharacteristically short statement that didn't mention the Minnesota governor by name. The GOP presidential nominee shared a cryptic post on his social media platform, Truth Social, shortly after Harris announced her pick that simply stated: ""THANK YOU!"" The typically reactionary Trump waited another roughly five hours to directly address the news: ""This is the most Radical Left duo in American history,"" the former president posted on Truth Social. ""There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again."" He went on in his 40-word missive to baselessly suggest that there is a ""BIG MOVEMENT"" to ""BRING BACK CROOKED JOE,"" an apparent reference to President Joe Biden, who withdrew his re-election bid last month amid pressure from top Democrats and donors. Trump followed that up with a longer exploration of his apparent fantasy that Biden will try to ""take back the Nomination"" when he attends the Democratic National Convention next week. ""He feels he made a historically tragic mistake by handing over the U.S. Presidency, a COUP, to the people in the World he hates most, and he wants it back, NOW!!!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. Though it seems clear Trump would rather face Biden in November, there's no indication the president is seeking to undermine Harris, whom Biden endorsed upon dropping out of the race and who formally secured the Democratic nomination on Monday. So far, Republicans appear to be struggling to come up with a cohesive line of attack against Walz, with some desperately taking shots at Walz because he created a Beyoncé Day last year ahead of her Renaissance Tour stop in Minneapolis. Others have accused the Democratic Party of being antisemitic because Harris, whose husband is Jewish, passed over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. ""No Jews allowed at the top of the Democratic Party,"" conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted on Tuesday, to which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, replied: ""News to me."" Trump will surely adopt a few talking points against Walz as the campaign goes on, but that his initial reaction was void of Walz-focused barbs and centered instead on an imagined scenario about Biden making a comeback is eyebrow-raising and, well, kind of ... weird."
130,Trump dances for votes in awkward effort to win young supporters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 13:51:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-adin-ross-interview-youth-outreach-rcna165419,"As part of his campaign’s effort to woo young voters, men in particular, Donald Trump gave another cringeworthy interview to a young, right-wing video streamer on Tuesday.  Trump met with Adin Ross, who has used his popular platform to promote people like neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes and who was banned from Twitch for ""hateful conduct"" after his stream featured an unmoderated chat filled with racial slurs. The fawning Trump interview came as Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has had a surge in popularity with young voters. And Trump’s appearance with Ross came days after conservatives launched a $20 million voter outreach effort designed to mobilize young, male voters using the pro-Trump podcast “Full Send,” the Ultimate Fighting Championship and other Trump-friendly platforms.  Interviews like these appear to be part of an effort to establish an air of coolness around Trump. And it's somewhat similar to what has been done with Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s self-described “coolest dictator in the world,” who is frequently touted by MAGA Republicans these days.  So what did Trump do to attract the youngs on Tuesday? He walked out to a 50 Cent song; he called antisemitic rapper Ye a “complicated” but “really nice guy”; and he claimed rapper Young Thug (aka Jeffrey Williams) has been treated “unfairly” by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is trying a RICO case against Willams — as well as that separate RICO case against Trump you may have heard about (both Williams and Trump have pleaded not guilty). There’s ample reporting about the Trump campaign’s attempts to align itself with rappers to lure young, Black male voters, and this seemed a continuation of those dubious efforts. As I’ve written in the past, Trump has tried to use the Young Thug trial to curry favor with Black men while sowing distrust toward Willis, who he has claimed is “racist” against him. (Williams' lawyer, for the record, has rejected similarities between that trial and the 2020 election cases.) Continuing his disturbing deference to authoritarian figures, Trump praised Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for purportedly making that country “safer than our cities.” Meanwhile, Maduro is currently refusing to leave office after the opposition and outside observers challenged his claim that he won re-election late last month, sparking mass protests that Venezuelan authorities have responded to with deadly force. I wouldn’t call that “safe.” Trump also did a herky-jerky dance while telling voters he’d “keep TikTok” if elected, reaffirming his latest stance on the app, the one he appears to have taken after a right-wing billionaire investor in TikTok endorsed his campaign. (Harris, who recently launched her own TikTok account, hasn’t said whether she supports the legislation, signed by President Joe Biden, to divest the company of its Chinese ownership.) Ross also presented Trump with a Cybertruck and a Rolex watch, which might have run afoul of campaign finance rules. In all of these interactions, Trump looked like a 78-year-old candidate who is grasping at straws to seem young and hip. Trump is literally dancing for votes now. This is only the beginning of the MAGA youth voter mobilization effort. They have millions of dollars to spend, and I expect much more awkward dancing to follow. "
131,"Report on Trump, Egypt, and $10 million sparks key questions",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 12:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/report-trump-egypt-10-million-sparks-key-questions-rcna165423,"There’s been an avalanche of news related to the presidential race lately, which may have overshadowed a Washington Post report that deserves public attention. The lede is an immediate attention-grabber: The Post’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that records indicate that four men ultimately arrived at the state-run National Bank of Egypt and carried away bags containing nearly $10 million in bundles of $100 bills. The money represented “what was then a sizable share of Egypt’s reserve of U.S. currency.” A variety of questions obviously came to the fore. Where’d the money go? What did officials linked to the Egyptian intelligence service want with roughly 200 pounds of $100 bills? According to the reporting, some FBI agents were concerned that the money was intended to go to Trump. In fact, those agents reportedly opened an investigation into whether Egypt illegally funneled $10 million in cash to the Republican for his 2016 campaign. And while that might sound like the basis for an incredible story, we’re just getting started. U.S. investigators, relying on U.S. intelligence, reportedly came to believe that Egypt’s then-president wanted to give Trump $10 million to boost his 2016 candidacy. Around the same time, Trump met with Egypt’s then-president, praising him on Fox News soon after as a “fantastic guy.” We don’t know whether Egypt gave Trump the money. We do know that a few weeks after Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi — the one who apparently wanted to give the Republican $10 million — Trump somehow produced $10 million of his own money for his campaign. It was, however, structured as a loan so Trump would get the money back. The then-GOP candidate, of course, ultimately won the election. It was during that presidential transition period, shortly before Inauguration Day 2017, when an organization linked to the Egyptian intelligence service picked up 200 pounds of $100 bills from Egypt’s state-run national bank. Soon after, Egypt’s president became one of Trump’s first foreign guests at the White House — a generous diplomatic gesture — and the then-American president ultimately released over $1 billion in military aid for Egypt. U.S. investigators never proved that the cash from that Egyptian bank went to Trump. That would’ve required access to more of Trump’s financial records, which they didn’t get. Why not? According to the Post, because then-Attorney General Bill Barr intervened to prevent FBI agents from subpoenaing Trump’s financial records. What’s more, Barr removed the relevant prosecutor — and her replacement — until the controversial A.G. finally arrived at a prosecutor who shut down the investigation altogether. Trump has denied wrongdoing, though as Rachel noted on last night’s show, he has the wherewithal to simply shut down all questions by releasing relevant financial records. To date, that hasn’t happened. A few months ago, Trump falsely accused President Joe Biden of “receiving money, for no apparent reason, from foreign countries.” Given this, it would appear that the former president has opened the door to some provocative questions from the recent past."
132,"Targeting Tim Walz, Team Trump flunks a test of self-awareness",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 08:23:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/targeting-tim-walz-team-trump-flunks-test-self-awareness-rcna165373,"No matter who Vice President Kamala Harris picked as her 2024 running mate, Donald Trump and his Republican campaign operation was prepared to go after him or her with a vengeance. In fact, it seems awfully likely that the over-the-top press statements and fundraising appeals were already written — and Team Trump was simply waiting for a name to fill in. It was against this backdrop that the former president’s campaign sent a solicitation to prospective donors this morning, telling them that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would “unleash hell on Earth” if the Democratic ticket prevails. No, seriously, that’s what the fundraising message said. But as it turns out, that’s not all the GOP nominee and his operation had to say. The Hill highlighted a written statement sent to the media from Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt: So, a few things. First, there’s nothing “dangerously liberal” about taking the climate crisis seriously. Second, it’s true that the Democratic governor restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people, but that’s a popular and just position for officials to take. But stepping back for a moment, is Donald Trump’s press secretary seriously prepared to make the case against convicted felons participating in our democracy? Because if so, Leavitt might be surprised to discover that in recent months, a jury found her boss guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. Indeed, it often seems as if the Republican Party is wholly unaware of the fact that it has a criminal leading its 2024 ticket. Trump himself recently declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” the GOP nominee said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” A little self-awareness goes a long way. The sooner Team Trump realizes that, the less embarrassing their public statements will be."

Gov. Geoff Duncan did something unusual: He became the first Republican to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 candidacy. This did not go unnoticed by the state GOP. On the contrary, the Georgia Republican Party responded to the news by launching an effort to expel Duncan from the party and ban him from ever again running as a GOP candidate. State party Chairman Josh McKoon added that Duncan will be “treated as a trespasser” if he seeks to attend any Georgia GOP event. Donald Trump — the one Sen. JD Vance said is not a “vengeful guy” — celebrated the Georgia Republican Party’s moves against Duncan, adding in an online message, “We have to purge the Party of people that go against our Candidates, and make it harder for a popular Republican President to beat the Radical Left Lunatics. Geoff Duncan is a loser who is disintegrating on his own. Congratulations to Josh McKoon for purging our Party of Misfits and people that don’t want to see us succeed!” As it turns out, Duncan isn’t the only Republican whom the former president is eager to “purge” from the party. Politico reported on one of today’s most notable congressional primaries: Though Trump usually endorses his favorite candidate in a given race, in this instance the former president endorsed both of Newhouse’s intraparty challengers: failed Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley and Jerrod Sessler, a former race car driver. (Technically, he endorsed Sessler four months ago, then told his followers a few days ago that he supports Smiley, too.) To be sure, Trump issues plenty of endorsements on a nearly daily basis, but this one stands out because of the motivation behind his campaign against the Washington incumbent. Revisiting our earlier coverage, when Trump was impeached for his role in the Jan. 6 attack, it resulted in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in American history. Against a backdrop in which Republicans seemed eager to move on from their failed, defeated president, 10 GOP House members voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the impeachment resolution, and they had every reason to believe they’d be vindicated by history. History, however, doesn’t elect members of Congress. Voters do. As the defeated, scandal-plagued, failed former president reclaimed control over the party and party leaders such as former Speaker Kevin McCarthy scurried to Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee, members of the Impeachment 10 came to realize that it didn’t matter that they were right. What mattered was that much of their radicalized political party wouldn’t tolerate their heresy, which would overshadow other parts of their careers in public service. Some saw the direction in the prevailing winds and decided to avoid the indignity of defeat. It’s why four members of the contingent — Ohio’s Anthony Gonzalez, New York’s John Katko, Illinois’ Adam Kinzinger and Michigan’s Fred Upton — announced their retirements before the 2022 primary season even began in earnest. Four more thought they could maintain the trust of the voters who’d elected them in the first place: It’s worth emphasizing for context that two of the four primary victors — Gibbs and Kent — ended up losing in the 2022 general elections, allowing Democrats to flip the seats from “red” to “blue.” As for the other two members of the Impeachment 10, California’s David Valadao narrowly won his re-election bid in 2022, while Washington’s Dan Newhouse cruised to a landslide victory two years ago. Trump has largely left Valadao alone, but the former president apparently believes Newhouse’s Washington district is conservative enough that he can help oust Newhouse, hand the nomination to an even more conservative rival, and the GOP can keep the seat. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
134,GOP insider: Trump’s anti-Harris messaging reflects a ‘nervous breakdown’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-kamala-harris-nervous-breakdown-election-2024-rcna165324,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party spent two years preparing for one thing: a 2024 race against President Joe Biden. The GOP nominee and his team knew what they wanted to say, how they’d say it, when they’d say it and to whom they’d deliver the message. The former president would be an imperfect messenger who’d struggle to stay on-script, but Republicans at least had something resembling a plan. And then Biden passed the torch. To hear GOP officials and their allies tell it, they were prepared for a pivot. Those assurances weren’t true. Indeed, in the first week of the overhauled presidential race, Republicans — when they weren’t targeting Vice President Kamala Harris with racism and sexism — were reduced to focusing on her laugh, her affection for Venn diagrams and weird complaints about plastic straws. The second week was no better. One Fox News personality apparently thought it’d be a good idea to talk about the Democrat enjoying wine. Another spent some time focusing attention on Harris hugging people. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy whined, more than once, that the incumbent vice president didn’t call him during his congressional tenure to talk about his party’s non-existent policy agenda. It was difficult to imagine swing voters in battleground states hearing all of this and thinking, “Well in that case, Harris has lost my vote.” And then, of course, there’s the GOP nominee himself — who’s now referring to Harris as “Kamabla” for reasons I don’t understand — who spent much of last week questioning the vice president’s racial identity in deeply ugly ways. When that message didn’t resonate, Trump apparently decided to roll out yet another line of attack: As Politico reported, the Republican spent much of the weekend asking people to believe the vice president is an idiot. That wasn’t an exaggeration. In one online missive, the Republican nominee argued that Harris is “a LOW I.Q. INDIVIDUAL” who “can’t put two sentences together!!!” In another, Trump wrote that the vice president is “really DUMB,” “unable to speak properly without a Teleprompter” and has “an extremely Low IQ.” At this point, I could write a paragraph or two talking about how Harris is, in reality, smart. I could also add some sentences about how Mr. Let’s Inject Disinfectant Into People probably shouldn’t go around questioning others’ intellectual prowess. I could even take some time to note that if Trump genuinely believed that Harris is “dumb,” he wouldn’t be so terrified of sharing a debate stage with her. But there’s a larger point that’s also worth keeping in mind as the campaign advances: The former president is starting to look awfully desperate. Trump thought the race was effectively over after his debate with Biden, and now that the contest has changed, his anxiety about a possible defeat is pushing him toward panic. “This is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,” Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee, told Politico. “This is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semi-conscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we’re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.” Election Day 2024 is three months away. Watch this space."
135,The most confounding similarity between Elon Musk and Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-06 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-election-2024-donald-trump-rcna165219,"There are a lot of unfortunate similarities between billionaire Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump. Both are petty and small-minded and crave the adulation of some of the most toxic people on the internet. But the most confounding connection hovers over Musk’s administration of X, just as it did over Trump’s White House, which is the question: “Just how much of this is on purpose?” Since acquiring X in late 2022, Musk has worked overtime to take a sledgehammer to what he’s perceived as the website’s faults. He’s laid off most of the staff, instituted wild swings in content moderation policy and otherwise broken what was once a vital part of the information ecosystem. The damage done is coming into sharp focus ahead of this fall’s presidential election, as a series of actions from the site broadly, and from Musk himself, raise suspicions of the reactionary CEO’s putting his thumb on the scale for Trump. After the success of a “Black Women for Harris” call on Zoom, another group, “White Dudes for Harris,” quickly followed its lead with a Zoom fundraiser of its own — raking in $4 million to support Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. But during that same call, the group’s X account, @dudes4harris, was suspended. Many quickly pointed fingers at Musk, accusing him of suspending the account because of its success and trying to keep more X users from donating. It’s not insignificant that just days before, Musk retweeted a Harris parody ad, in which a deepfake version of Harris appeared to call herself “the ultimate diversity hire.” Despite being a deepfake — digitally altering video of Harris’ mouth to match a voiceover — there was no label to indicate the video was manipulated, potentially breaking X’s own policies. Meanwhile, the “artificial intelligence” tool that Musk ordered built for the platform, Grok, has put out misleading info of late, falsely claiming that Harris has missed the ballot deadline in key swing states after President Joe Biden dropped out last month. And as CNBC reported, a federal political action committee that Musk created set up a website that claimed to help viewers register to vote. People with ZIP codes in battleground states, however, got no such help, instead only having their personal data collected. The last two of those have prompted major concern from election officials. A group of five secretaries of state drafted an open letter to Musk to call him to task for Grok’s misinformation and urge him to fix the bot’s output. Separately, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who signed on to that letter, also informed CNBC that her office is investigating whether America PAC’s information-gathering bait-and-switch was a violation of state election law. To be sure, none of the above cases are slam dunk evidence of shady practices at Musk’s X. The PAC’s webpage could just be broken, as one person with knowledge of its operations told CNBC that the links in question once worked — which tracks with Musk’s generally incompetent management of the site formerly known as Twitter. Experts likewise told CNBC that it’s unclear whether any Michigan laws were violated, even if it weren’t merely an innocent snafu. Grok’s promoting misinformation about ballots could also be less about Musk’s own issues and more about the shoddy state of AI in general. As for the “White Dudes for Harris” account’s being suspended? The Washington Post reported it was taken down for hours “because of ‘a user report’ for ‘violating [X’s] rules against evading suspension.” It’s not unthinkable that an unofficial account with no direct link to the Harris campaign’s blowing up that quickly — and asking people for money — tripped an internal alarm to ward off potential fraud. It’s a morass of high-stakes chaos and confusion, and it’s bringing up memories of Trump’s time in office for me. From the beginning of his administration, his increasingly sycophantic staffers transformed his whims into policy — and the results were frantic and volatile. But especially in the early days, it was often valid for an observer to stop and wonder how much of what we were seeing was normal government activity tinged through the lens of Trumpism versus actual departures from the norm. In those moments, it was likewise usually up in the air how much of the stress test of the system was the result of incompetence or deliberately plotted extremism. What I came to realize then, though, is that the answer to “is this incompetence or malice” all too often is “it doesn’t matter.” Intention was, and is, less important than the real-world effects of what we’re seeing. Whether due to malevolence or being terrible at his job, Musk has made X into a cesspool for anyone hoping to find the truth. And the reality is that as Musk has become more openly revanchist in his worldview, X has become a platform that is all too willing to let right-wing misinformation spread. It’s a forgoing of responsibility that is having deadly impact in the United Kingdom — and could have similarly disastrous effects if left unchecked during the U.S. election."
136,Kamala Harris is getting the thing Donald Trump always craves: attention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 15:04:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-donald-trump-games-attacks-attention-rcna165254,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 4 episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki."" Kamala Harris could announce her running mate at any moment, with the vice president set to reveal her pick ahead of their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday.  But the fact is, no matter whom she chooses, the announcement of this pick will only build even more momentum for the Harris campaign.  The vice president has already held a series of big, energizing rallies, like last week’s event in Atlanta featuring Megan Thee Stallion, where the rapper coined the phrase “Hotties for Harris.” She’s also brought on all-star campaign veterans like David Plouffe, Stephanie Cutter, Jennifer Palmieri and Mitch Stewart — adding to an already seasoned team.  The money continues to pour in at a crazy pace. The Harris campaign said this week they raised a record-breaking $310 million in July. She’s also up in the polls. Harris has a one-point edge nationally over Donald Trump, and the two are neck and neck across the collective battleground states, according to a new CBS News poll. Harris’ momentum is clear to anyone watching. What’s also clear is that all the attention on Harris is driving Trump kind of crazy — and he is twisting himself into a pretzel as a result.   At his rally on Saturday in Atlanta, Trump said some very strange things. Like when he congratulated President Vladimir Putin of all people for the historic prisoner swap that freed American citizens from Russia. He also repeatedly attacked Georgia’s very popular, very Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for not being sufficiently loyal. Despite their contentious past, and Kemp not supporting Trump in the primary, the governor was reportedly open to campaigning with the former president this fall. However, after Trump’s latest comments, that’s unlikely to happen. Like I said, he’s twisting himself into a strange pretzel. Earlier on Saturday, before sending his congratulations to a dictator and bashing a popular member of his own party, Trump made another self-sabotaging move — pulling out of a debate he already agreed to participate in.  Trump now says he won't attend the scheduled audience-less ABC News debate on Sept. 10. Instead, he proposed a debate on Fox News a week earlier with a full arena audience. Let’s pause on that for a moment: Trump’s saying he will not participate in a debate he already agreed to unless it turns into a MAGA rally with Fox moderators. Got it. Harris quickly called out the former president: “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space.’” As someone who’s worked on campaigns, I can tell you exactly what this is — this is what it looks like when one candidate has momentum and the other has no idea what to do about it. Here’s the thing: Harris will continue to own the spotlight for a while here. Her vice presidential pick is coming, she’ll hold rallies with her running mate all across battleground states next week, and a couple of weeks later, we’ll have the Democratic National Convention. And Trump is going to hate every second of that because he loves attention. As a result, he will get more and more outrageous and unhinged. That means we’re likely to see even more ugly, racist attacks like the one we saw from Trump in Chicago when he questioned the vice president’s racial identity.  But there is good news: Harris seems ready to respond to these attacks.  She told a crowd in Houston that Trump’s comments were just more of “the same old show,” and said the American people “deserve better.” “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us — they are an essential source of our strength,” Harris went on. That’s sort of the perfect response to all of this — to the racist attacks, to the unhinged rallies, to the games over debates: It’s the same old stuff, and America deserves better. Harris doesn’t make it about her. She makes it about the people they are running to represent. Not a bad message if you ask me.

137,Donald Trump is out of control,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 13:59:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/donald-trump-kamala-harris-rally-georgia-rcna165244,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 5 episode of “Morning Joe.” During a campaign rally in Atlanta on Saturday, Donald Trump reignited one of his favorite old feuds. The former president spent roughly 10 minutes of his time on stage attacking Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, calling him “disloyal” and a “bad guy.” Trump told the crowd he blamed the governor for his criminal charges in the state, claiming Kemp could have shut down Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ investigation with a “phone call.” Now, attacking a popular sitting governor in his own state — a state you almost certainly will need to take back the White House — isn’t exactly a successful campaign strategy. And the only thing the former president succeeded in doing on Saturday was bringing even more negative attention to himself.  Trump clearly sees the enthusiasm surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. He knows enthusiasm comes first, then comes the uptick in the polling — which we’re already starting to see. If momentum continues to build for Harris, Trump knows where this is heading in November. What we saw Saturday was Trump responding to a chain of events that’s starting to feel out of his control.  Right now, he's grasping for anything. Trump's getting nastier, angrier and less disciplined. Every modicum of self-control he summoned during that weeklong period after the assassination attempt on him seems to be gone — like it's evaporated. "
138,Supreme Court rejects Missouri's far-flung bid to intervene in Trump's N.Y. case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 13:31:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/missouri-trump-gag-order-supreme-court-rcna165238,"The Supreme Court rejected an extreme long-shot attempt by Missouri to intervene in Donald Trump’s New York criminal case. That state wanted to sue the state of New York and block the former president’s gag order and upcoming sentencing following his guilty verdicts on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The high court denied Missouri’s motion Monday without explanation, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito noted in the order that they would have let the state file its complaint. While the two justices have recently sided with Trump, they have also previously signaled their disagreement with colleagues over the broader procedural issue of hearing lawsuits between states, indicating that they think the court must take such cases. This sort of case is different from the typical appeal at the Supreme Court, instead falling under the court’s “original” jurisdiction for suits between states. “New York’s prosecution of the presumptive Republican nominee is a transparent attempt to prevent the candidate disfavored by New York from freely campaigning,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, wrote to the justices last month, adding that it “threatens both the sovereign rights of Missouri and the constitutional rights of millions of its citizens.” New York Attorney General Letitia James opposed Missouri’s action, writing to the justices that “Missouri’s suit is based entirely on an ongoing criminal case between the Manhattan DA and former President Trump and does not present an actual controversy between sovereign States.” Trump is due to be sentenced in New York next month, but not before Judge Juan Merchan decides how, if at all, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling affects Trump’s state guilty verdicts. Merchan is expected to rule on the immunity issue Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects Trump’s immunity motion. The GOP presidential nominee also recently lost a New York state court appeal challenging his gag order ahead of sentencing.

139,I'm Black and Asian. Trump's attack on Kamala Harris was an attack on me.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 10:36:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-attack-kamala-harris-nabj-racist-xenophobia-rcna164871,"As a woman of color who has spent my whole life fighting bigotry, I didn’t think I could be more offended by the candidate running for president at the top of the Republican ticket. But then, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) made former President Donald Trump sit on a stage with three Black women journalists, where he illustrated the full extent of his racist xenophobia. Trump made many offensive remarks in that appearance Wednesday in Chicago; chief among the triggers for me was the way he questioned the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has now enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination and is soon expected to officially become the first Black woman and the first Indian woman to head a major party’s ticket. Trump said, “She was … of Indian heritage…until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He then asked ""Is she Indian or is she Black?” It’s incredible that in 2024, he asked that question — as if she couldn’t possibly be both. Harris’ background is well documented. Her father is a Black Jamaican. Her mother was Indian. Thirty-eight years ago, she graduated from Howard University, an HBCU, where she pledged the country’s oldest Black sorority. Trump remains trapped in the era in America in which people were expected to have a single racial identity. And, to be clear, that time was not so long ago. As recently as 1997, I left Jamaica as a woman of both Black and Asian heritage. I knew myself, without controversy, to be biracial. Then I arrived in the United States, where I was only Black. Suddenly, I found myself explaining my Chinese surname to white people who questioned me about it. If the conversation went further, then I had to make the case for identifying as both Black and Chinese. This reality was starkly different from my experience back home, where my Asian heritage was not in opposition to my Black heritage. In post-colonial Black Jamaica, being mixed carried some measure of privilege — it also came with some derision, but never, ever, denial. Everyone there accepted me as Black and Asian. In the United States, I was expected to be Black or Asian.  In a 2019 interview on “The Breakfast Club,” Harris said it herself: “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. I was born Black, I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.”  Trump has seized upon a video of her in the kitchen with the Indian American actress Mindy Kaling in which Harris enthusiastically affirms Kaling’s description of her as Indian and tells the actress, “You look like the entire one half of my family.” Kaling says, “I’ve been telling people we’re related already. This is perfect.” In a social media post, Trump says Harris “is saying she’s Indian, not Black. This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” Trump seeks to take the power of belonging to both Black and Indian cultures from Harris. He attempts to delegitimize her by insisting that belonging to both makes her some sort of traitor, somehow deviant, freakish, abnormal. Trump is tapping into a disturbingly pervasive American belief in a racial binary, that you’ve got to be one thing or another. Black folks all over the world know our community is of mixed-racial heritage. We understand that the one-drop rule, which says that anybody with one drop of Black blood is Black, is, at its core, reductive. That rule was meant to exclude Black people from the privileges afforded only to those possessing the visible quality of whiteness; being of mixed race often denied you a white heritage, but your Black racial identity was never contested. It was always yours to keep, perhaps because no one inside the racist patriarchy could imagine anyone else wanting it. But in the present political climate where the percentage of white voters is shrinking — Harris being doubly of color makes Trump nervous. That she could excite Black voters to the extent that they were excited when Barack Obama ran for president is making the party of white nationalism nervous. That she could consolidate the Indian American vote makes her a double threat. That she could inspire women to turn out this November makes her a virtual atomic bomb to the GOP. Historically, people of color had to be whatever white people said we were. Now that they’re afraid that being a person of color may provide some limited benefit, they wish to intimate that race is something mutable, subject to flights of fancy. It is terrifyingly revealing, that the practice of racial exclusivity, which Black people had nothing to do with, is being refashioned into a weapon against Harris in the moment when her blackness could be of some benefit to her and the community that supports her bid for the presidency.  James Baldwin, who was born 100 years ago this month, said it best, “We can disagree and still love each other, unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.” Trump’s comments deny the humanity of biracial people and challenges our right to exist. He bugles a call being taken up by many who follow his lead. The day Biden endorsed Harris for president, I posted on Instagram, “OMG!!! We got a Black Woman in the US presidential election!” In no time, there were more than 500 comments from the MAGA camp denying Harris’ Blackness, berating her as the unqualified DEI hire and accusing me of being racist. Multiple people reported the post as offensive. Some directly messaged me to ask how I would feel if they had posted about a white man running for president. When my answer did not suffice, I was dismissed as a “dumb coconut” who didn’t deserve to vote because I didn’t have the good sense to see through a candidate who was pretending to be Black to get my vote. Pretending to be Black. Unless they look white and are trying hard to pass, nobody’s Blackness in America is invisible. To suggest that Blackness is a cloak that Harris can put on and remove at will is to discredit the experience of millions of voting Americans who navigate the pitfalls of racial oppression daily. What his off-the-rails performance at the NABJ convention illustrates is Trump’s inability to come to terms with the changing face of the Unites States of America. Trump, the MAGA candidate, longs for the good old days when he could, at least before he got sued by the Justice Department, bar Black people from renting his properties. He is angry at a world that dares to proffer a Black woman, an Indian woman, as a serious contender for president. He does not wish to live in this new, emerging America. That’s one of many reasons he should not be elected to lead it."
140,Half of Trump’s former Cabinet secretaries haven’t backed his 2024 bid,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 10:06:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/half-trumps-former-cabinet-secretaries-havent-backed-2024-election-rcna165185,"Imagine you were an employer looking to hire someone for your workplace team. You’ve collected some résumé, but to help make a decision, you decide it’s best to check with applicants’ references. After all, to get a sense of how someone would perform on the job, it makes sense to ask those who’ve worked with him/her in the recent past. Then imagine you reach out to an applicant’s former colleagues, and when you ask whether they’d extend their support, nearly half of them hesitate. In fact, some are quite explicit in warning you not to hire the applicant. Would you hire the person anyway? Keep the question in mind when reading the latest Washington Post report on Donald Trump’s former Cabinet officials: By the Post’s count, 42 people, at some point between January 2017 and January 2021, served in Trump’s Cabinet. Based on the latest tally, 24 of them — roughly 57% — are publicly supporting their former boss’s ongoing candidacy. The rest either won’t take a position or have declared publicly that they won’t support the Republican Party’s 2024 nominee. It’s worth emphasizing that the Post’s assessment is rather generous to the former president: Former White House chief of staff John Kelly, for example, has been brutal in his condemnations of Trump, but the newspaper’s official tally lists the retired general as not having taken a firm stand on the former president’s re-election bid. Nevertheless, this is an exceedingly tough dynamic for Republicans to defend. Indeed, one of the reasons I’ve been preoccupied with this angle for quite a while is because it simply has never happened before: Presidents have been known to clash from time to time with individual members of their administrations, but Trump is unique in facing so much opposition from his own team. As ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos recently summarized during an appearance on MSNBC, “His secretary of state called him a ‘moron.’ [Former Defense Secretary James] Mattis says he doesn’t even respect the Constitution. John Kelly says he’s the worst person he ever met. Think about that applying to any other president of the United States at any other time. “Their chief of staff, their defense secretary, their secretary of state, their national security adviser are the ones who had the most damning judgments of his competence and character. That is chilling.” In June, President Joe Biden was equally eager to draw attention to this. “Take it from the people who know Donald Trump best — he is unfit to be president,” the Democratic incumbent concluded. As we discussed last year, members of a White House cabinet have a unique perspective on an American presidency. After a president chooses them for their powerful positions, these cabinet officials routinely work closely with the person behind the desk in the Oval Office, learning first-hand how a president thinks, works, prioritizes, processes information, and leads. I’ve long wondered what might persuade voters inclined to support Trump to change their minds. Who, if anyone, will they listen to? Clearly, these voters will not be persuaded by pundits. Or lawmakers. Or historians. Or prosecutors. Or committee reports. Or special counsel investigations. But perhaps they’ll consider listening to those who worked closely with Trump, and who are now keeping their distance as he tries to regain power. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
141,"On the politics of electric vehicles, Trump says the quiet part loud",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 08:31:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/politics-electric-vehicles-trump-says-quiet-part-loud-elon-musk-2024-rcna165166,"Donald Trump has been unsubtle in his condemnations of electric vehicles. After taking steps to stymie the industry during his presidency, the Republican added EVs to his party’s list of culture war villains after leaving the White House. Last fall, for example, Trump told an audience that people who own electric cars become “somewhat schizophrenic“ because they can only drive their cars for 10 minutes. Around the same time, he insisted that gas-powered cars are better for the environment than EVs. (They’re not.) In December, the GOP candidate added that electric vehicles don’t “go far” and have to be recharged “every two minutes.” As recently as June, a Washington Post report noted that the Republican nominee “has made bashing EVs a cornerstone of his campaign.” And yet, there’s been an unmistakable shift of late in the former president’s posture. As a recent New York Times report summarized: At an event in Michigan two weeks ago, for example, the Republican said, “I’m constantly talking about electric vehicles but I don’t mean I’m against them. I’m totally for them.” He added that he’s driven EVs “and they are incredible.”Saturday night in Atlanta, Trump went even further, and said the quiet part loud. “I’m for electric cars,” the former president said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. “I have to be, you know, because [Tesla’s Elon Musk] endorsed me very strongly. So, I have no choice.” I’m reminded anew of a recent Politico report with a memorable headline: “Trump keeps flip-flopping his policy positions after meeting with rich people.” As we discussed last week, the list of such incidents keeps growing. It includes TikTok, Anheuser-Busch and the cryptocurrency industry, but Trump’s newfound praise for electric vehicles — he has “no choice” because of Musk — is perhaps the most extraordinary because of the time and effort he invested into telling American consumers not to buy EVs. That is, until he decided they’re “incredible.” Trump pointed to Musk’s endorsement, but it might not be the only consideration. The New York Times recently reported that Musk was “likely” to offer “significant” support for a new pro-Trump super PAC created by Musk’s closest friends. The Wall Street Journal had a related report, noting that the conspiratorial billionaire is prepared to spend “around $45 million a month” in the hopes of putting the Republican back in power. Musk later denied the accuracy of the reporting, though Trump personally suggested that Musk is, in fact, investing $45 million a month in support of his candidacy. The Republican added soon after that he intends to “make life good” for Musk and people like him in a prospective second term. For his part, CNBC reported late last week that the conspiratorial billionaire and his allies are “collecting data in more than a half-dozen swing states” in the hopes of giving Trump a boost. An NBC News report added that a Musk-backed political action committee “has been acquiring detailed voter information from those living in Michigan and other battleground states after people submit their personal data through a section on the PAC’s website that says ‘register to vote.’” The tactics are now under investigation from the Michigan secretary of state’s office and North Carolina's state attorney general's office.

142,Judge Chutkan already busy on Trump docket after immunity delay,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 08:20:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-chutkan-trump-election-interference-case-rcna165135,"U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is attempting to move Donald Trump’s federal election interference case forward after it returned to her docket Friday. Over the weekend, she denied the former president’s motion to dismiss the case based on “selective and vindictive prosecution” and set a court date for next week. The Obama appointee issued an order on Saturday setting a conference to discuss the case on Aug. 16 (she said Trump doesn’t have to attend). Ahead of that date, she ordered the prosecution and the defense, by Friday, Aug. 9, to “confer and file a status report that proposes, jointly to the extent possible, a schedule for pretrial proceedings moving forward.” Of course, the main event to come is for Chutkan to apply the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling to Trump’s case, to see what’s left of it after the high court announced a new test that at least limits prosecutions against former presidents. To what extent the ruling ultimately curbs special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump remains to be seen. We should get a sense of how the parties want that litigation to proceed by how they lay out their respective positions to Chutkan in the status report this week, after which the judge will decide what happens next in connection with the Aug. 16 conference. The litigation is set against the backdrop of the looming presidential election, whose outcome could determine whether the case continues at all, because Trump will likely get rid of it if he regains the power to do so. Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of Trump’s other federal case, over alleged unlawful retention of classified documents and obstruction, though that appeal won’t likely be fully resolved before the election. As for Trump’s other two criminal cases, the Georgia case is tied up on a pretrial appeal and the New York case is set for sentencing in September unless it’s derailed by immunity-related litigation. (Remember: Presidents can’t dismiss or pardon state charges.) Also on Saturday, Chutkan rejected one of Trump’s claims that doesn’t turn on immunity: that he was selectively and vindictively prosecuted. At the outset, Chutkan took Trump’s lawyers to task for their “improper reframing of the allegations.” She corrected his “alternate narrative” that he was charged for merely disputing the outcome of an election and working with others to propose alternate electors. Rather, the judge noted that he’s charged “with knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.” Chutkan then rejected Trump’s argument that President Joe Biden and the special counsel launched the prosecution to prevent him from retaking the White House. “Finding no evidence of discriminatory purpose in the sources Defendant cites, the court is left only with his unsupported assertions that this prosecution must be politically motivated because it coexists with his campaign for the Presidency,” the judge wrote. Rejecting his vindictive prosecution claim — that he was only charged after he publicly criticized the 2020 election and certain government officials — Chutkan wrote that Trump “has presented no evidence demonstrating a likelihood of vindictiveness.” That long-shot motion wasn’t expected to succeed, and its denial shows Chutkan clearing the decks ahead of a possible trial. Still, whether and when such a trial will happen is unclear. That will partly turn on the outcome of the forthcoming immunity litigation and, perhaps more immediately, November's election. As ever, his best legal defense is becoming president again. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

143,Why Trump’s offensive against Georgia’s Republican governor matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 07:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-offensive-georgias-republican-governor-brian-kemp-2024-election-rcna165156,"About a week ago, Sen. JD Vance appeared on Fox News and assured the public that Donald Trump is not a “vengeful guy.” By all appearances, the Ohio Republican wasn’t kidding — though the comment was unintentionally hilarious to those of us familiar with the former president’s record. Six days after Vance’s on-air declaration, Trump proved his hapless running mate wrong in spectacular fashion. The Associated Press reported: The new offensive against Brian Kemp, Georgia’s incumbent GOP governor, began in earnest on Saturday afternoon, when Trump posted an odd screed to his social media platform. To hear the former president tell it, the governor only won the office because of Trump’s support, and years later, the former president is blaming Kemp for his state’s crime rates and underwhelming economy. The missive went on to call the conservative governor a “bad guy,” who could’ve derailed Trump’s criminal prosecution in the state “with a phone call.” Hours later, the GOP presidential nominee kept going. As a Washington Post report summarized, “Trump mocked him sarcastically and called him ‘Little Brian’; repeatedly called him ‘disloyal’; blamed Kemp for Trump being charged in Georgia by a prosecutor whom Kemp has criticized; suggested Kemp wanted Republicans to lose elections; and argued Georgia would have better crime and economic numbers if Kemp were no longer governor.” That’s really just a sampling. Trump also targeted the governor’s wife and goaded his followers into booing their own home state’s Republican governor. It’d probably be an overstatement to say the 2024 candidate attacked Kemp more than Vice President Kamala Harris, but it was close. Perhaps most importantly, though, the former president singled out the Georgia governor for failing to commit election fraud to benefit him in 2020. It was only natural to wonder why in the world the Republican Party’s presidential nominee would repeatedly attack a GOP governor, in his own competitive state, with three months remaining before Election Day. Indeed, Georgia Republicans were apparently baffled by Trump’s offensive. But the man the public saw on the stage in Atlanta was a familiar figure: Kemp didn’t help Trump cheat four years ago, and he did little to boost his primary candidacy four months ago, so the former president felt justified in throwing a tantrum — indifferent to electoral and/or strategic considerations. For Democrats, the spectacle was notable, not just because of the inherent value in seeing Trump invest so much energy into attacking an ostensible ally, but also because of the larger messaging. The night President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign, someone who works in Democratic politics sent me a text that said a Harris-Trump match-up would be “the future vs the past.” The Republican nominee would be on the ballot for the third consecutive cycle, the argument went, while the Democratic nominee would offer voters something new and exciting, despite being an incumbent vice president. The point was obvious: In a contest between stale and fresh, bet on the latter. It was against this backdrop that Trump went to Atlanta, lied about his 2020 defeat (again), lashed out at local officials (again), targeted an intraparty foe’s spouse (again), recycled derisive nicknames (again), and even congratulated Russia’s Vladimir Putin (again). It’s as if Trump heard about “the future vs the past” framing and decided to help prove the point."

In 2018, for example, after a gunman killed 17 people in a Florida high school, the Republican boasted that he would’ve had the courage to run into the school during the mass shooting. In remarks to the nation’s governors, the then-president said at the time, “I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” It was a difficult line to take seriously, but it was a peek into a weird perspective: In Trump’s mind, he’s effectively an action star. People were supposed to believe the septuagenarian president would’ve voluntarily run into an ongoing deadly crisis, where he’d confront a teen armed with an assault rifle, carrying with him nothing but his wits and his bare hands. Trump’s reality, of course, is far different. The former president is better known for promising to take the stand in court cases, only to back down with the pressure on. He’s also the candidate who thought it’d be a good idea to agree to a presidential debate in September, only to ditch the idea when Democrats rallied behind a candidate that scares him. NBC News reported: There were some headlines over the weekend about Trump “agreeing” to debate Harris, but that’s not quite what happened. Rather, what Trump decided to do was back out of a debate he and his team had previously agreed to, while simultaneously proposing a different event, the details of which he prefers. The Republican originally said he’d appear at a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News, without an audience. The GOP nominee has abandoned that commitment, instead saying he’s prepared to appear at a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News, “with a full arena audience.” It’s not altogether clear whether Trump ran this by Fox News — the network had pitched the idea of hosting a possible event on Sept. 17 — though it’s also possible that the former president is working from the assumption that Fox will simply follow his directions. For Harris, all of this is apparently absurd: The incumbent vice president has said she’ll stick to the plan that Team Trump originally agreed to, and she’s asking the former president to honor his commitment. That, evidently, isn’t likely to happen. After months of “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping, Trump posted an item to his social media platform that read, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” None of this comes as too big of a surprise. Almost immediately after Biden ended his re-election campaign, the GOP nominee started backing away from a possible debate. On Friday morning, before formally ditching the existing plan, Trump told Fox Business, “I mean, right now I say, why should I do a debate?” At some level, the former president probably realizes this makes him look like a coward, but in the electoral calculus, he’s apparently concluded that it’s better to look weak than show up on a debate stage and look worse. So where does this leave us? While presidential debates have become a common staple in recent decades, in the not-too-distant past, such events were rarities. In the 1964, 1968 and 1972 election cycles, for example, Americans did not see the major-party nominees share a stage. Unless Trump musters the courage to change his mind, 2024 will be a throwback to that bygone era."
145,"With Putin, Trump ignores ‘do not congratulate’ advice (again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-05 05:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/putin-trump-ignores-not-congratulate-advice-rcna165128,"In the spring of 2018, relations between the United States and Russia were at a delicate stage. Vladimir Putin’s government had been credibly accused of launching a poison gas assassination attempt on British soil; the White House had just announced sanctions against Russia in response to its attack on our elections; and the Kremlin had just orchestrated a sham election that kept Putin in power. It was against that backdrop that Donald Trump was scheduled to have a telephone meeting with the Russian leader. The then-American president’s national security team prepared briefing materials, directing Trump to condemn the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. As for Putin’s re-election, the same U.S. officials wrote in all capital letters, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE.” It was a message the Republican couldn’t miss. It was, however, a message Trump was prepared to disregard. As regular readers might recall, the then-American president spoke to Putin, ignored his own team, made no mention of the poisoning, and congratulated Putin as if the Russian election had been legitimate. The incident was striking for a variety of reasons, and it made clear that when it comes to his autocratic allies abroad, the Republican likes to issue congratulatory declarations. More than six years later, Trump is still congratulating his benefactor in Moscow. The Washington Post reported: “I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal,” the GOP nominee told a rally audience in Atlanta on Saturday. He added, “We have 59 hostages; I never paid anything. ... Boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals. It’s nice to say we got ’em back, but does that set a bad precedent?” At issue was an incredibly complex diplomatic feat, negotiated between seven countries — some of which don’t get along especially well. Trump’s first instinct was to complain bitterly about the agreement that brought home four U.S. residents who’d been wrongly imprisoned in Russia. His second instinct was to publicly congratulate, not the officials from his own country who negotiated this historic deal, but the head of the adversarial country who improperly imprisoned the U.S. residents in the first place. As for the idea that Trump “never paid anything” to secure Americans’ release, the former president continues to lie about his record, and as the Post’s report added, he “authorized an agreement to pay $2 million to North Korea for medical bills in the release of Otto Warmbier.” Nevertheless, it’s Trump’s public praise for Putin — or more to the point, his latest public praise for Putin — that stands out. Indeed, his new congratulatory message comes on the heels of the Republican pointing to the Russian leader for validation to justify his position on Ukraine. Which came on the heels of the former American president celebrating the fact that Putin was echoing his talking points about the 2024 election and Trump’s multiple criminal indictments. Which came on the heels of Trump telling a Mar-a-Lago audience how “smart” Putin was for invading a neighboring country. Which came on the heels of Trump describing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as “genius” and part of a “wonderful” strategy. Which came on the heels of years’ worth of Trump kowtowing, genuflecting, and repeatedly showing abject weakness toward his Russian ally. U.S. intelligence officials have spent months alerting the public to the fact that the Russian government has launched a “whole-of-government” effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, hoping to return Trump to power. As recently as last week, NBC News reported, “The U.S. intelligence community believes the Kremlin will direct its propaganda efforts to support former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, an intelligence official indicated on a media call Monday.” Let no one wonder why. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
146,Harris campaign says Trump is ‘running scared’ after he floats Fox News debate with new rules,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-03 09:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-debate-kamala-harris-audience-fox-news-rcna164990,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is insisting that Donald Trump honor his commitment to the ABC News debate on Sept. 10, rather than schedule an entirely different debate with new terms and a new date. “Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” the Harris campaign said in a statement on Saturday. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept. 10.” After refusing for several weeks to commit to debating Harris, the former president wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday that he had “agreed” to a Fox News debate against her on Sept. 4 with a “FULL ARENA AUDIENCE,” reneging on previously agreed-upon debate rules that he had set with President Joe Biden’s campaign. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment sent by NBC News early Saturday. Not having a live audience at the debate had been one of the Biden campaign’s key demands, especially against an opponent who is more prone to lying and delivering sound bites than to engaging in substantive policy discussion. Trump has waffled on his participation in the Sept. 10 debate since Biden dropped out of the race. Harris has repeatedly challenged Trump to meet her on the debate stage, and Democrats have taunted the former president as being “afraid” to go up against Harris, a former prosecutor. In his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the ABC News debate had been “terminated” because Biden had stepped aside, and he cited his ongoing litigation against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos as a “conflict of interest” (while using a disparaging distortion of Stephanopoulos’ name). Trump’s defamation lawsuit against Stephanopoulos and ABC News had already been underway when his campaign agreed to the Sept. 10 debate with the network. The Harris campaign said Saturday that it would be “happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to.” The de facto Democratic nominee will still appear at the ABC News event whether or not Trump participates, her campaign said."
147,The real reason Team Trump keeps trying to call Kamala Harris a ‘DEI hire’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-03 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/team-trump-calls-kamala-harris-dei-hire-rcna164117,"Despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ education, her years as a prosecutor, her having served as California attorney general and a U.S. senator, Republicans such as Reps. Harriet Hageman, of Wyoming, and Tim Burchett, of Tennessee, are among many who have referred to her as a “DEI hire.” Hageman said: “I think she’s one of the weakest candidates I’ve ever seen in the history of our country. I mean intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel. ... I think that she was a DEI hire.” Burchett referred to her as “our DEI vice president.” They could have attacked Harris’ record without referring to DEI, but instead they chose to say “DEI hire” and “DEI vice president” to perpetuate a narrative that people of color and women can only be in positions of power or authority because of quotas, preferential treatment and unfair advantage given to them based on their social identities. That is: not because of their education, qualifications, training or experience. These false racist and sexist attacks seek to reinforce beliefs that the best, and potentially only, people qualified to lead America are white men. Attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion are attempts to maintain the status quo.    Attacking the credibility of people of color, women, people with disabilities and others from historically marginalized groups is nothing new in America. The only thing new is the collective misrepresentation of the term diversity, equity, and inclusion to do it. The acronym DEI has been weaponized by people who feel threatened by the racial diversification of America and its leadership; the success of women in corporate and public sector jobs; the mere presence of people with disabilities in the workplace and in society; as well as the increased visibility of LGBTQ+ people and their families. They perceive that reality as an existential crisis. In addition to elected officials, there have been numerous recent examples of highly visible powerbrokers and pundits denigrating people of color, specifically Black people, claiming they are unqualified for the positions they hold, and that they were hired based on their race, not merit. In January, not long after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in flight, Elon Musk took to his social media platform X to criticize efforts by United Airlines and Boeing to diversify their pilots and factory workers. “It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE,” he wrote, misspelling the acronym.  He was responding to an X user who speculated about the IQs of pilots who attended historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. The next day, Musk said, “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening.” His lie that the airline’s DEI policies had endangered the public was shared with millions of X users. Again, this is not new. First, powerful opponents of progress sought to discredit and gut affirmative action policies. Now they have their sights set on anything they choose to label DEI. This strategy to characterize Black people as unqualified, framed within the context of “DEI hires,” is a targeted effort to attack policies and practices that have created pathways to leadership and power for people of color, women, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, and others. Because while “DEI hire” has been most frequently used to discredit women and people of color, it is also used to devalue the contributions of people with disabilities and other marginalized and oppressed identities. The weaponization of the term DEI cuts across sectors and disciplines, including in health care and medicine, where I have had health care executives tell me that DEI efforts in hospitals or medical schools lower standards and thereby jeopardize the quality of care provided to patients. One health care executive went so far as to say that “a diverse hire,” another way to say DEI hire, would underperform because they trained at an HBCU. Although factually inaccurate, these beliefs about DEI have taken hold in our national narrative.  So, what is DEI really? Diversity, equity and inclusion supports full participation of all people; promotes fair treatment through the intentional use of power, policies and practices; and values individuals within the context of their identities, not in spite of them. It is a response to glaring inequities throughout society, particularly those in education and employment. Recent reversals of public and institutional policies that advance DEI are most often the result of orchestrated resistance by people who believe that DEI will disenfranchise and disempower white people, especially white men. Frankly, the data does not support those claims. After decades of policies and practices to support DEI, inequities in opportunities and pay continue to plague women and people of color. A 2021 study by Judd Kessler and Corinne Low found that “firms hiring in STEM fields rated minority and female candidates significantly lower than white males. Among STEM majors, to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75 GPA, a minority or female candidate needed a 4.0.” Even with DEI policies in place, Black women make 66 cents on the dollar compared with their white male counterparts, when doing the same jobs with comparable qualifications. These statistics and examples indicate the necessity of DEI. They also point to how dangerous the misappropriation and weaponization of DEI is to decades of slow and fragile social progress and policy change.  The truth about DEI is that it promotes American values that are necessary for a healthy, functional and thriving democracy. It is consistent with ideals such as liberty and justice for all people. That is not a zero-sum game where one group’s gain is another’s loss. Instead, it is America making good on its promise to create a society where everyone can flourish and contribute their talents and skills to the collective good while having a fair chance to succeed. These ideals are woven into the complex fabric of who we are as a nation, and we cannot afford to regress to darker times.

148,Biden's historic prisoner exchange was a feat Trump could never have achieved,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 15:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-biden-prisoner-exchange-russia-rcna164944,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" On Thursday, basketball star Brittney Griner helped lead the U.S. women’s basketball team to victory against Belgium at the 2024 Paris Olympics.  The reason that victory was possible — the reason Griner was able to represent the U.S. in these Olympic games — was because of a feat of diplomacy by President Joe Biden. In February 2022, Griner was detained in Russia on trumped-up charges related to cannabis products found in her luggage. By August, she had been sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. But just a few months later, in December of that year, Biden announced that he had negotiated a historic prisoner swap — securing Griner’s safe release.  That’s why Brittney Griner was able to play for Team U.S.A. in the Paris Olympics. But Griner was not the only American prisoner being held in Russia, and the Biden White House sought to use the momentum from her release to continue negotiations for other hostages.  There was Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested on espionage charges in Russia back in 2018, charges that the U.S. and Whelan have both denied. And Vladimir Kara-Murza, an American green-card holder and longtime free press advocate in Russia. His arrest appeared to be an attempt by Vladimir Putin to silence one of his biggest critics.  Putin would go on to take even more prisoners. People like Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist working for The Wall Street Journal — who was also arrested on trumped-up espionage charges. And Alsu Kurmasheva, another American journalist who was arrested in August 2023 for failing to register as a foreign agent. All of them were being held as prisoners of the Russian government …until Thursday. On Thursday, in another historic series of negotiations, Biden secured the release of all four of those prisoners as part of a remarkably high-stakes, multilateral negotiation. In total, 24 people were released: 16 held captive by Russia and eight by the U.S. and our European allies. It was the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the Cold War. That on its own is extraordinary — but the details of how this deal came together are really something.  For years, families, friends, and employers of these American prisoners have been advocating for their release. In particular, the staff of The Wall Street Journal have been pushing relentlessly and publicly for the return of their colleague. The plight of Gershkovich even became an issue in the presidential election as former President Donald Trump boasted that Gershkovich would only be free once he was elected president: “Vladimir Putin, president of Russia will do that for me,"" said Trump, ""and I don’t believe he’ll do it for anyone else.” Trump thought he alone could secure Gershkovich’s release. But many people felt otherwise — including Gershkovich’s own mother. According to The Wall Street Journal, “In April of last year, she had rushed up to President Biden at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and grabbed his hands before imploring him: ‘You are the only one who can bring my boy home.’” She was right. Not only did Biden secure the release of Gershkovich and the other hostages, he did so using a careful and skillful strategy that Trump — and probably a lot of other politicians — simply could never pull off. For starters, Putin’s price for the release of these hostages, the key bargaining chip, was Vadim Krasikov. In 2019, Krasikov was arrested for assassinating a Chechen dissident in Berlin on behalf of Russia’s intelligence agency. Krasikov was a Kremlin-linked assassin serving a life sentence in Germany. He is someone so close to Putin that Western intelligence officials reportedly speculate may have even been the Russian president’s own personal bodyguard. To secure the release of these prisoners, Biden needed to get Germany to agree to release a very high-profile criminal back into Russian custody. That’s not something the German government was eager to do. But Biden made strengthening American bonds with NATO allies, like Germany, a cornerstone of his foreign policy — a stark reversal from the Trump-era policy of alienating Western democracies in favor of autocrats and dictators. And so, when the time came for Germany to play its part and release that Russian assassin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly told President Biden, “For you, I will do this.” President Biden first started working to secure support from our allies in the summer of 2023. By early 2024, it looked like a deal was coming together. But then, the whole thing nearly fell apart. One of the prisoners who the U.S. and Europe were hoping to get released as part of the deal was Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. But just a week after Biden secured Germany’s support, Navalny mysteriously died in a Russian prison, prompting global outrage. Biden then dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to help ensure the arrangement with Germany and other allies would hold. According to NBC News, at a February meeting between Harris and Scholz, the pair discussed the prisoner swap the U.S. was working toward. According to the official, Harris raised something Biden had recently discussed with the chancellor — that Germany’s release of Vadim Krasikov was a critical component of getting a prisoner swap with Russia.  A White House official said, “She moved the ball forward significantly in that meeting.” The official also said Harris’ meeting in Munich with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob was arranged specifically to try to help bring Slovenia on board with the multicountry prisoner swap. These meetings continued for months. Then, on July 17, the Biden administration got the news that the deal had finally come together.  That date is significant: It was the day Biden was diagnosed with Covid. Four days later, on Sunday, July 21, at 12:45 p.m., Biden was on the phone with the Prime Minister of Slovenia, hammering out the final details of the deal.  That date is also significant: just one hour later, Biden released a statement announcing his exit from the presidential race. Imagine, for a second, the kind of focus and fortitude it takes to be working on these kinds of high-stakes negotiations — at the same time that you’re making the most difficult decision of your political career ... and also recovering from Covid. Imagine, for a moment, what would have happened if it was Donald Trump in that situation. A man who has made a political career out of maligning America’s geopolitical alliances and who has been criminally charged for his efforts to stay in power.  Thursday’s act of delicate diplomacy was possible only because Joe Biden is the president.

When asked whether Trump’s comments — which were roundly condemned as racist and even alarmed some Republicans — gave him pause, the Ohio senator said they did not. Vance added: This wasn’t the first time that Vance — who himself has had the authenticity of his Appalachian ties called into question — has used the line of attack on the vice president. At a campaign rally earlier this week, he said that Harris had used “a fake Southern accent” during an event in Atlanta and suggested that she was more Canadian than American. (Harris lived in Canada for about six years as a teenager.) The ease with which Vance endorsed Trump’s attack on Harris should put past comments of his own under scrutiny. While running for the Senate in 2022, Vance pushed back on his Democratic opponent’s charge that he was promoting the “great replacement” theory — even though he manifestly did — and pointed to his children, who are white and Indian, as proof that he had not engaged in racism. “What happens is that my own children, my biracial children, get attacked by scumbags online and in person because you are so desperate for political power that you’ll accuse me, the father of three beautiful biracial babies, of engaging in racism,” Vance said at the time. That Vance has decried racist attacks on his children and yet is now endorsing an attack on his political opponent’s biracial identity is worth noting. In his comments to CNN, Vance appeared to equate Harris’ leaning into her different racial identities at different times as part of a broader pattern of her flip-flopping on issues. But there’s a difference between changing one’s stance on a topic — as Vance himself has done — and the immutable fact of Harris’ biracial identity. Vance, as the father of biracial children himself, should know that."
150,Trump's federal election interference case is back with Judge Chutkan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 13:26:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-federal-election-case-chutkan-immunity-rcna164930,"The federal election interference prosecution against Donald Trump is finally back in the trial court. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan can now apply the Supreme Court’s ruling bestowing broad criminal immunity on former presidents to Trump’s case, to see what’s left of it after the high court imposed a new and murky immunity test. It’s unclear what precise form that complex project will take — whether with written briefs, hearings or a combination of the two. What’s clear is that a trial won’t happen before November’s presidential election and that if Trump wins that election then his federal cases are good as gone (special counsel Jack Smith is appealing Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the other federal case, regarding classified documents and obstruction). In the July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States, Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion said the court is sending the case back to Chutkan to decide “in the first instance” how the immunity test applies to Trump’s case. Recall that the ruling said former presidents are entitled to at least presumptive immunity for all “official acts.” It’s now on the lower court to figure out whether some of his alleged conduct in trying to subvert the 2020 election was official or unofficial, and whether prosecutors can rebut the presumption of immunity for certain official acts. As an example of what Chutkan must decide, Roberts noted that she needs to examine, “with appropriate input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” Whatever Chutkan decides may be appealed again to the justices before any trial can happen, further making any pre-election trial impracticable. The bigger question now is, if Trump loses in November, what will remain of the indictment after it’s fully litigated through the courts, which could take months at least. The case, which was previously set for a March trial, had been on hold while Trump pressed his immunity appeal. Adding another variable, the immunity opinion also noted the Supreme Court’s ruling this past term in Fischer v. United States that narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 defendants. As Trump is charged with obstruction-related counts, among others, Roberts’ ruling said in a footnote, referencing the obstruction statute: “If necessary, the District Court should determine in the first instance whether the Section 1512(c)(2) charges may proceed in light of our decision in Fischer.” We’ll likely know the next steps in the case through Chutkan’s docket, where she may issue an order telling the parties how she’ll proceed.

151,"Eyeing another Trump term, Vance leaves ACA repeal on the table",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 09:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-aca-repeal-affordable-care-act-obamacare-election-2024-rcna164892,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign announced this week that it’s investing $50 million in support of a new television ad called “Fearless.” It’s a good 30-second spot, with a fairly straightforward message. Viewers are told (a) about the Democrat’s background as a prosecutor; (b) Donald Trump’s plan to give more tax breaks to the rich; and (c) Republican plans to end the Affordable Care Act. The commercial wraps up with Harris declaring, “We are not going back.” The fact that the ad specifically referenced the ACA might’ve surprised some viewers. After all, when we think about the hot-button issues that are dominating the public discourse this year, health care isn’t widely seen as one of them. But Democrats clearly hope to change that, and the candidates on the Republican Party’s presidential ticket occasionally lend a hand. Sen. JD Vance, for example, spoke with NOTUS this week, and the report noted, the Ohio Republican “suggested repealing Obamacare would still be a priority” if voters return Trump to power. The report added that Vance went on to say in the same interview that the Trump-era “repeal and replace efforts” were “fundamentally focused around the idea of fixing what was broken, not about stripping people’s health care away. So yeah, I think you’re certainly gonna see efforts to reform the system. Obviously, what that looks like will depend a little bit on Congress because Congress has to have a role to play.” As a substantive matter, Vance’s assessment didn’t make a lot of sense. His condemnation of the ACA — which he’s too inexperienced to have voted on — not only misdiagnoses the existing challenges surrounding the Affordable Care Act, it also badly misstates what transpired during Trump’s first term. But looking ahead, what arguably matters most about Vance’s comments was the fact that he left little doubt in a Trump second term, Americans should “certainly” expect a prospective Republican White House to “reform” the nation’s health care system. “Donald Trump and JD Vance are the greatest threat to Americans’ health care today,” Harris for President spokesperson James Singer said in a statement, responding to the NOTUS interview. “Terminating the Affordable Care Act has been Trump’s goal for years, which will make America sicker, rip away preexisting condition protections from more than 100 million Americans, and increase health care costs. ... The stakes this November couldn’t be higher for the American people.” The problem, of course, goes well beyond Vance and his latest comments. Indeed, Trump largely ignored the ACA after leaving the White House, but as regular readers know, the former president had targeted Obamacare in increasingly explicit terms over the past year, and as recently as December, the Republican posted a video to his social media platform attacking the late Sen. John McCain for not helping him “terminate” the ACA in 2017. Trump soon after vowed to tear down the nation’s existing health care system and replace it with something he said would be “better” — though his assurances didn’t include any details. What’s more, as we’ve discussed, some of his congressional allies have added their voices to this debate. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told Axios in late November, “I think Obamacare has been one of the biggest deceptions on the American people. I mean just look at your health care premiums.” (Premium costs, in reality, have gone down, not up.) The same report added that Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, who’d likely chair the Senate Finance Committee if the GOP retakes control of the chamber, also said he’s open to repeal-and-replace plans. Remember, the Republicans’ 2017 effort to tear down the ACA was a disaster for the party, which Democrats exploited to help take back the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats would love little more than to have this fight again in 2024 — a recent national survey from NBC News found the party with a 23-point advantage over the GOP on health care — which made Vance’s comments this week all the more significant. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Trump's interview was delayed by more than an hour, and at the time he blamed audio issues for the holdup. ""The speaker equipment at the NABJ is not working properly. Don’t blame me for being late!"" he posted on Truth Social. The technical issues were apparent during the interview, but Lemon told Axios that they ""were resolved very quickly."" Yet, Trump still refused to go on stage if he was going to be fact-checked, Lemon said. “The bigger problem was his threat not to take the stage when he had agreed to go on,"" Lemon added. ""He did not want to be fact-checked, but we could not let him on the stage without fact-checking."" Lemon's comments square with previous reporting that the interview was delayed because Trump objected to the live fact-check shortly before the event began. Lemon told Axios he was preparing to announce that Trump would not appear because of the fact-checking dispute when the GOP nominee walked on stage. The Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, disputed Lemon's explanation for the delay to Axios, saying that Trump waited ""for close to 40 minutes while audio/technical issues were fixed by NABJ."" ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott attempted to push back on several of Trump's lies onstage, though he repeatedly talked over the interviewers. The interview's late start seemed to set the tone for Trump's antagonistic approach to what my colleague Ja’han Jones described as a “car crash of an event.” Trump — whose campaign has been trying to win over Black voters — repeatedly attacked Scott and ABC News. He lied exhaustively, and he ranted and deflected when asked straightforward questions. He also unveiled a confounding new line of attack on Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning her biracial identity and accusing her of not really being Black."
153,Prisoner deal undermines one of Trump’s attack lines against Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 08:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prisoner-deal-undermines-one-trumps-attack-lines-harris-rcna164870,"Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, and when the host started to ask how international leaders would respond to a Kamala Harris presidency, the Republican interrupted before she was even done with the question. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be like a play toy.” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” In context, the implicit racism and sexism in the on-air comments seemed obvious. The fact that Trump was an international laughingstock during his White House tenure didn’t help matters, either. But the idea that Harris wouldn’t be taken seriously on the international stage was also discredited by reality soon after Trump made his ugly remarks. The Wall Street Journal reported: The Journal’s report added that Harris had met Scholz previously on several occasions, and as an administration official put it, the vice president had a “good working relationship with him.” That’s “part of the reason why she was able to have a really good, frank conversation with him.” A White House official also confirmed with NBC News that when it came to the difficult international process, Harris “moved the ball forward significantly.” Note, Harris hadn’t met Slovenia’s Golob before this year’s Munich Security Conference, and as the Journal’s report noted, “Their meeting was the highest-level U.S. engagement at the time with the Slovenian government, which was holding two Russian nationals Moscow wanted released. That meeting was also restricted to just Harris, Golob and two aides.” Slovenia soon after agreed to participate in the international deal, which is what happens when foreign officials take U.S. officials seriously."

It’s a rule Donald Trump hasn’t always followed. Exactly three years ago this week, for example, the former president lashed out at the U.S. women’s soccer team after they “only” won Bronze medals. “If our soccer team, headed by a radical group of Leftist Maniacs, wasn’t woke, they would have won the Gold Medal instead of the Bronze,” the Republican declared in a written statement. “Woke means you lose, everything that is woke goes bad, and our soccer team certainly has.” Trump added that he wanted to see “Patriots” replace “the wokesters” in future games, suggesting Americans should root not for their country’s athletes, but rather, for conservatives and against liberals. But as it turns out, sometimes Trump sends barbed messages to Olympians, while other times Olympians send barbed messages to Trump. NBC News reported: “Simone Biles being the GOAT, winning Gold medals and dominating gymnastics is her black job,” Davila wrote. “I love my black job,” Biles responded, adding a black heart emoji. To be sure, the gold medalist did not specifically reference the GOP candidate online, but the ""black job” reference was hardly subtle. Trump is, after all, responsible for pushing the phrase into the political lexicon: The former president first used the line during a debate in late June, and he elaborated on this at a National Association of Black Journalists conference this week. It’s tempting to think Trump’s running mate might want to come to his rescue in this instance, but given his own rhetorical history, I think Sen. JD Vance probably ought to sit this one out. The New York Times reported: “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” Vance said at the time. If the Republicans’ 2024 ticket is smart, Trump and Vance will let Biles’ latest comments go without notice. If recent history is any guide, however, the former president seems likely to start another feud. Watch this space."
155,"Returning to his roots, Trump promotes Harris’ birth certificate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 07:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-promotes-kamala-harris-birth-certificate-election-2024-rcna164848,"The headline on a Punchbowl News report on Thursday stood out: “It’s 2016 all over again following Trump’s racist attacks on Harris.” A day earlier, a Fox News personality told viewers that there’s “2016 energy” around this year’s presidential race. A NOTUS report had a related message today: ""A woman atop the Democratic ticket. GOP lawmakers dodging the press. Trump. Birtherism. The 2024 election has a bit of everything that made 2016 memorable."" At first blush, the analysis seems compelling. In 2016, Donald Trump faced the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket; he targeted her with ugly and sexist attacks; and eight years later, the Republican is recycling many of the same words and phrases as he prepares to face the second woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket. All the while, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pretending to have no idea what Trump is saying, which is similarly reminiscent of what the political world saw during his 2016 candidacy. But to fully appreciate the scope of the former president’s ridiculous antics, perhaps it’s best to look back even further — not to 2016, but to 2010. Trump has spent much of the week questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial and ethnic identity, suggesting the nation’s first Black vice president might not be Black enough by his standards. But as a New York Times report noted, the Republican nominee went even further yesterday. Yes, the conspiracy theorist who helped pioneer the racist “birther” attacks against Barack Obama — several years before he came down the escalator and took over GOP politics — has decided, more than a decade later, to once again take an interest in another Black candidate’s birth certificate. As Off Message's Brian Beutler argued, this is less like 2016 and more like what voters would've heard ""if Trump had challenged Obama in 2012 as a birtherism dead-ender."" The Washington Post asked Loomer yesterday whether she's the one who brought this line of attack to Trump’s attention. “Probably,” the right-wing personality replied, noting that she’d shared the image with the former president. Common sense suggests Trump, given his ridiculous antics targeting Obama's background, should steer clear of even passing references to birth certificates, but evidently, he can’t seem to help himself."
156,Why Trump isn’t celebrating as Americans return home from Russia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-02 05:50:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-isnt-celebrating-americans-return-home-russia-rcna164827,"As President Joe Biden’s term enters its homestretch, it stands to reason that the Democratic incumbent might be thinking about his legacy and his accomplishments. If so, it’s quite likely that Biden realizes that Thursday’s developments, and his role in making them happen, won’t soon be forgotten. NBC News reported: Biden described the diplomatic efforts that led to the release of the four U.S. detainees a “feat of diplomacy and friendship,” which was more than fair given the circumstances. Indeed, given the available details, the story reads like a dramatic film involving international intrigue, secret talks, complex diplomacy, and reunited families. But as the credits rolled, and audiences cheered, Donald Trump sat on his hands. It would’ve been easy for the Republican nominee to celebrate the return of Americans who’d been unjustly detained by Russia, but the former president instead published a biting missive to his social media platform, posing a series of barbed questions that made his annoyance clear. After asking whether the Biden administration was giving Russia “cash” — the White House had already answered that question, explaining that Russia would not get money from the agreement — Trump complained that officials from his own country “never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps.” In case that weren’t quite enough, the GOP candidate went on to write, “Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING. ... “They’re calling the trade ‘complex’ — That’s so nobody can figure out how bad it is!” For now, let’s put aside the fact that when Trump claimed he gave up “nothing” to get Americans back, he was brazenly lying. Instead, let’s focus on why the former president’s first instinct was to whine about good news for his own country. Trump can’t claim credit: Sure, some Republican partisans, including his running mate, peddled silly claims about the former president playing some indirect role in the developments, but Trump seemed to realize that he had nothing to do with this. And if Trump can’t plausibly claim credit for good news, then the news, practically by definition, can’t be good. Trump said this wouldn’t happen: The Republican spent months publicly arguing that he, and he alone, would have the wherewithal to bring Gershkovich home. Oops. Trump almost certainly couldn’t have pulled this off: The lynchpin of the deal was diplomatic work with Germany. When Trump was in office, he tapped a notorious online pest to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Germany, where he managed to routinely infuriate our allies in Berlin. In fact, Trumps ambassador was so reviled that some German officials spoke publicly about the possibility of asking him to leave the country. The agreement was the result of alliances that Biden strengthened and Trump intends to weaken: As Biden explained on Thursday, he and his team “rebuilt NATO. We rebuilt the circumstances to allow this to happen. That’s why it happened.” These are the same alliances, of course, that Trump has been hostile toward for years. No wonder the GOP nominee isn’t happy."
157,Why Kamala Harris’ biracial identity upsets Donald Trump so much,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 16:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-interview-kamala-harris-black-indian-nabj-rcna164736,"Early in Donald Trump’s meltdown at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists convention, the former president offered unsolicited commentary on the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. “She was Indian all the way,” Trump said of his presumptive opponent, “and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person. Somebody should look into that.” There is a multitude of problems with Trump’s comments, from his presumption that he has the expertise and jurisdiction to judge someone else’s identity to his argument that Harris lacks the racial bona fides to merit the Black audience members’ allegiance. But the former president’s ramble offers another important conclusion: Trump simply doesn’t understand race. When Trump asks for somebody to “look into that,” the truth is that for years researchers have looked into that. What they’ve found is that overly simplified perspectives on race like Trump’s are not only misplaced, but they are counterproductive and dangerous. Scholars of race have long argued, and demonstrated, that race is a socially constructed category that still has very real outcomes. We, as members of society, constantly construct, deconstruct and reconstruct what race means. Even the basics of how race is measured in America have evolved over time. The 1850 U.S. census was the first to acknowledge people of multiracial descent, with the category “Mulatto” used as a way to exclude them from having full political rights. Not until the 2000 census were multiracial Americans able to formally mark more than one racial identity. In fact, the multiracial population is the fastest growing racial group in the United States, with a 276% increase between 2010 and 2020. As ABC News’ Rachel Scott pointed out to Trump, Harris “has always identified as a Black woman. She went to a historically Black college.” (Harris graduated from Howard University, where she was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically African American sorority.) But in Trump’s worldview, you’re either Indian or you’re Black. You cannot be both. This is ironic considering his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, is the father of three biracial (Indian and white) children. Trump doubled down on this sentiment after the NABJ interview: At his rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that same day, his campaign displayed a graphic quoting Harris as having referred to herself as the “first Indian-American senator.” Which, of course, she was. And which, of course, does nothing to disprove her Blackness, because she is both. Trump fails to grasp what census takers recognized more than two decades ago and what Walt Whitman wrote two centuries ago: We contain multitudes. Harris is Indian. Harris is Black. This isn’t a contradiction. Trump’s recent comments mark but one in a series of episodes showing he shares a misunderstanding all too common even in today’s increasingly diverse and multiracial society: the (hyper) essentializing of race and other social categories. Researchers describe essentialism as seeing particular qualities as being intrinsic or inherent to a particular group of people. These beliefs (e.g., all women are bad at math) start to form in early childhood and can further solidify as one ages depending on one’s further socialization. Trump’s false confidence in the essentialized either/or nature of identity leads him to believe that once he knows what you are, he’ll also know how you’ll think and act. It opens the door to thinking that Jewish voters who opt for his opponent are “bad Jews,” his frequent claims about the monolithic notion of “Black jobs,” and referring to anyone who criticizes Israel — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer — as “a Palestinian,” even if Schumer was born in Brooklyn. Acknowledging the existence of multiracial identities completely scrambles this perspective and upsets the stereotypes that Trump holds close to his heart. People can claim more than one identity without being disingenuous. Our identities are not limited to those labels others apply to us. Individuals who share aspects of their identities — whether race, gender, religion or otherwise — cannot be expected to all think, act or vote in the same way. It is likely too late for Trump to accept and fully grasp that millions of Americans are multiracial. But we hope that his racist comments will prompt other Americans to think more flexibly about identity."
158,Donald Trump has always been ‘weird.’ Here's why it won’t work against Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 14:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-weird-kamala-harris-rcna164753,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 1 episode of ""Way Too Early."" Let’s talk about Donald Trump’s week.  Things started to kick off on Tuesday with Trump policing who is and isn’t a good Jew. The former president called a conservative radio show to escalate his attacks on Jewish Democrats, calling them “fools” and saying they “should have their heads examined.” Then on Wednesday, Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania where he mistakenly referred to Republican Senate candidate David McCormick as the state’s “next governor.” Twice.  Earlier that same day, Trump made an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference and took aim at his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris — accusing Harris, who's biracial, of “turning Black.” So in 24 hours, Trump went from deciding who’s a good Jew to who’s really Black or who’s really Asian.  This is a guy who is clearly struggling to find his footing against Harris. So what does he do? He goes back to his original playbook, one that dates back even further than 2016. He’s trying to play the greatest hits of birtherism all over again. Ever since the Republican Party’s convention it seems Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have leaned into the weirdness. It’s almost like Trump is saying, “Boy, you know that Vance is really weird. Hold my beer, because look what I’m going to do here.” But Trump’s appearances aren’t a one-off. What we witnessed this week is pure Donald Trump. This is who he is. This is what he looks like when he’s in a somewhat hostile environment and asked tough questions. He has a meltdown. This is a moment in American politics where you step back and realize that you have the Republican candidate for president playing the race card and engaging in some of the worst kinds of racial stereotyping. It's a repulsive moment in American politics, but it’s also a reminder of what Trump is doing and all he represents."
159,"Trump is right about ‘two systems of justice,’ but for the wrong reasons",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 14:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-two-systems-of-justice-jan-6-pardon-rcna164658,"Donald Trump complained about “two systems of justice” when asked at a National Association of Black Journalists panel discussion about his support for Jan. 6 defendants. But to the extent that those criminal defendants (including Trump) have been treated differently, they’ve fared better than the average defendant on multiple fronts. Take their Supreme Court success, for example. As we know, the court recently bestowed broad criminal immunity on former presidents, which happens to help the GOP presidential nominee in his own criminal cases. In another appeal this past term, the court narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. The justices didn’t have to intervene in either dispute — indeed, they reject most appeals — much less rule how they did. On top of help from the justices, journalist Radley Balko observed that Jan. 6 defendants have been largely at liberty before trial, with the courts being “far more likely to release Capitol rioters pre-trial than other defendants.” There’s also the special treatment that Trump has vowed to apply on the back end of the criminal process if he returns to the White House. He said Wednesday that he would “absolutely” pardon Jan. 6 defendants “if they’re innocent.” Likewise, if he wins in November, Trump may also attempt a legally untested self-pardon, though he may more likely have his newly installed attorney general dismiss his two federal cases; presidents can’t pardon people for state charges. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases and was found guilty in the one case that has gone to trial so far, in New York.) That’s saying nothing of any revenge he would seek to exact if he regains power, something that would solidify a two-tiered justice system — but not how he meant.

Trump held a moment of silence for Comperatore, whom he called ""a hero to all of us."" Yet even as he honored the late firefighter, Trump appeared to make an off-the-cuff quip while talking about his widow’s grief. The GOP presidential nominee told the crowd that a friend of his had given Comperatore's family a $1 million check, and he also made reference to money donated to the family's GoFundMe. ""But you know what? Corey's wife said, 'I'd rather have my husband,'” Trump said. “Isn’t that good? I know a lot of wives that would not say that — I’m sorry,"" he continued, as the crowd laughed. ""They would not say that."" Trump's unfiltered manner of speaking has long been a quality reviled by his critics and beloved by his supporters. His crude attempts at levity and flippant comments in somber situations — especially while he was in office — have contributed to a longstanding perception that he's callous and unempathetic. Comperatore, 50, was killed while trying to protect his wife and two young daughters when a 20-year-old gunman opened fire at Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Two other men, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were critically wounded but have since been released from the hospital. Comperatore's family said that Trump reached out to them days after the shooting. His widow, Helen Comperatore, has said that President Joe Biden also called her family that weekend, but she declined to speak with him out of respect for her husband, who she said was a ""devout Republican."" “I support Trump. That’s who I’m voting for, but I don’t have ill will towards Biden,” she told the New York Post at the time."

After Trump’s trial ended with guilty verdicts on all counts in May, Judge Juan Merchan partially terminated the order as it pertained to trial witnesses and the jury, but kept its restrictions on speech targeting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s staff, court staff, their family members as well as family members of Bragg and Merchan. In a ruling on Thursday, the state appeals court rejected Trump’s argument that the trial’s conclusion was a change in circumstances warranting terminating the order completely prior to sentencing. “The fair administration of justice necessarily includes sentencing,” the appeals court wrote, citing the limited nature of the remaining order and noting that “threats received by District Attorney staff after the jury verdict continued to pose a significant and imminent threat.” The GOP presidential nominee is set to be sentenced Sept. 18, assuming Merchan rejects the former president’s immunity motion in a ruling due Sept. 6. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, rendered after Trump’s trial, raised questions about its effect, if any, on the so-called hush money case.

Donald Trump, appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention, thought it’d be a good idea to go after Vice President Kamala Harris on race. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the Republican presidential nominee said of his likely opponent on the Democratic side. “I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the former president added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded: “Is she Indian, or is she Black?” The backlash was immediate — and widespread. Even some Republicans described the GOP nominee’s racism as “embarrassing” and “awful.” An Axios report described Trump’s offensive as “a nightmare” for his party. But let’s not lose sight of the fact that Trump’s new line of attack wasn’t limited to the stage in Chicago. After the event, he used his social media platform to push a follow-up salvo. “Crazy Kamala is saying she’s Indian, not Black,” he wrote alongside a video of Harris referencing her Indian heritage. “This is a big deal.” Soon after, ahead of a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump’s political operation promoted images on a giant screen featuring headlines noting Harris’ Indian-American identity. On Thursday morning, as NBC News noted, the Republican nominee pushed the line of attack again. This, evidently, is Trump’s idea of a gotcha. So, why in the world is he doing this? I won’t pretend to have any special insights into the former president’s weird perspective, but the answer isn’t immediately obvious. It’s possible that Trump thinks he can convince Black voters that Harris isn’t Black enough. Or maybe Trump thinks it’s up to him, and not Harris, to decide how she should describe her own race and ethnicity. It’s also possible that Trump, whose lengthy record of overt racism is well documented, is genuinely confused about the very idea of someone being biracial. If Harris has celebrated her mother’s background, as far as the Republican sees it, it necessarily means she rejected her father’s background. Or maybe Trump’s brand of racism is based in part on the idea that those in communities of color get special breaks and benefits, making him uncomfortable with the idea of an opponent being able to check more than one box. Whatever the explanation, it seems like a safe bet that voters haven’t heard the last of this line of attack, even if many GOP officials would prefer to hear Trump say anything else. UPDATE (August 1, 2024, 2:26 p.m. ET): Shortly after I published this piece, Trump used his social media platform to amplify a related online item from right-wing media personality Laura Loomer, who claimed that Harris’ birth certificate ""proves"" that she's not Black."
163,Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion are on Kamala Harris' side — that's bad news for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 09:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-harris-beyonce-megan-thee-stallion-2024-rcna164566,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 30 episode of “The Beat.” Newly released audio of Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has revealed what the vice presidential candidate really thinks about the 2024 Democratic ticket shake-up. Vance privately told donors Vice President Kamala Harris’ entrance into the race was “a little bit of a political sucker punch”: “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.” To say Harris isn’t struggling is an understatement. She is thriving. While no one knows who will win in November, Republicans can clearly see Harris’ appeal. That kind of appeal is the reason the party pushed hard at the Republican National Convention to feature anything that might feel somewhat cool or current — from Hulk Hogan to rap videos to Instagram star Amber Rose. Republicans know culture matters to voters.  But now the party now has the oldest nominee ever. While Donald Trump did have a run on television and a presence online before he entered politics, “The Apprentice” debuted 20 years ago. It’s a relic of a reality TV past. Harris, on the other hand, taps into the now and the future. That much is evident from the soundtrack of her first campaign video, which features a song from a superstar currently on music charts: Beyoncé. In the song “Freedom,” Beyoncé recounts fighting uphill battles, both personal and political: “Freedom! Where are you? ’Cause I need freedom, too! I break chains all by myself.” And while the Harris campaign’s song choice does have political appeal, this isn’t just posturing from a candidate. The vice president is a genuine, longtime Beyoncé fan, even attending a show last year in the tour’s official sparkle theme attire.  As a senator, she shouted out Beyoncé's documentary, “Homecoming,” for how it “celebrates” historically Black colleges. The feeling seems mutual. In 2020, on the eve of the election, Beyoncé posted a photo on Instagram wearing a Biden-Harris mask — broadcasting her approval of the ticket to over 300 million followers. Pop culture is a language young people speak fluently. That demographic was crucial to the winning Biden-Harris coalition in 2020. In 2024, the vice president needs their support again.  Most voters oppose fake posturing from politicians, and Harris comes across in this cultural moment honestly. She did even so before there were signs she would top the ticket.  Harris has used her platform as vice president to elevate artists and art forms Washington has long ignored. Last year, she hosted a celebration at her official residence to mark hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. The event featured artists like Lil Wayne and Jeezy.  The celebration became something of a national Rorschach test: Do you see energy, optimism and inclusion? Or do you see something else? It’s clear the Republicans want you to see something else. On Tuesday, Trump released his first attack ad on Harris, featuring video of her dancing from that 2023 hip-hop celebration — an attempt to portray the vice president as somehow less serious of a politician. But as Republicans continue their attacks on Harris, trying to see what sticks, another star has thrown her support behind the vice president: Beyoncé's fellow Houstonian Megan Thee Stallion. The rap star is no stranger to political statements. In 2021, she dropped her own anthem about women’s rights. The music video shows a Republican senator, in a MAGA-red tie, going online to hypocritically attack her in misogynistic terms. In the video, Megan confronts him for disrespecting the women who keep things running. On Tuesday, Megan Thee Stallion joined Harris for a rally in Georgia, where the star urged her fans — dubbed “Hotties” — to stand behind the vice president. A “Hot Girl Summer” for Harris, indeed. From Beyoncé to Megan Thee Stallion to Charli XCX, the vice president’s set list of support keeps growing longer and longer by the day.

164,'Super genius' economists say Trump budget is costlier than Harris plan,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 03:48:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-penn-wharton-economy-harris-rcna168687,"For what feels like the umpteenth time, experts are highlighting major aspects of Donald Trump’s economic policy that could hurt the economy and spike deficits. Two new reports from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model — part of the school Trump has attended and described as “super genius stuff” — found the GOP presidential nominee's economic proposals would increase the deficit nearly five times more than Vice President Kamala Harris' plans.  As CNBC explained: In contrast, here’s how CNBC summarized the Harris report: CNBC added the caveat that much of the revenue Harris hopes to generate with her economic plan requires congressional approval. But even with that caveat, the predictions are stark: Trump’s economic proposals would be all but certain to raise deficits dramatically — as he did when he was president — relative to Harris’ plans, which could cost about a fifth as much as his, according to the reports. Polls suggest most Americans feel the candidate most equipped to handle the economy isn’t always the candidate with the most salient economic plan. Trump’s plan has been panned several times now, despite his apparent polling strength on the issue.  The Penn reports follow a joint letter from 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists in June, who warned that Trump’s economic plan — particularly, his plan to deport immigrants en masse and impose 10% tariffs on all imports — would fuel inflation. And Moody’s Analytics came out with a report in June that reached a similar conclusion.  It's no wonder Trump and his campaign have worked so hard to undermine their movement’s faith in economic experts."

Trump’s campaign has framed the addition of Kennedy and Gabbard, who are both former Democrats, to its team as proof that Trump has assembled a “broad coalition” that has expanded “across partisan lines.” Kennedy and Gabbard don’t represent significant Democratic constituencies, however. They’re fringe, idiosyncratic political players who’ve long had supporters on the right. Trump's tent didn't necessarily get bigger; in fact, this is a potential narrowing of his coalition, as there’s a chance that, by bringing Gabbard and Kennedy under his wing, Trump alienates more voters than he wins over. It is standard — and savvy — for parties to point out that they appeal to people across the aisle. At the Democratic National Convention, Democrats attempted to make that case by inviting several Republicans to speak on the main stage, such as former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. Having people like Kinzinger speak about how they’ll be voting for Democrats and not Trump’s GOP is powerful because Kinzinger is still a Republican and during his time in office he was aligned with the Republican establishment. He was first elected during the tea party wave — endorsed by Republican former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — and as my colleague Steve Benen has pointed out, Kinzinger’s voting record in Congress was that of a traditional Republican partisan. His strident opposition to Trump, then, has the potential for credibility with certain sectors of the GOP. Kennedy and Gabbard, a former representative from Hawaii, aren’t analogous to Republicans like Kinzinger. Even when Gabbard was in the Democratic Party, her outlier positions on foreign policy made it an awkward fit. In office, Gabbard praised Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Syria strategy over former President Barack Obama’s, met personally with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and argued in favor of aligning with his brutal regime and insisted Democrats weren’t calling out Islamist terrorism clearly enough. She fared poorly in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, where her value add as a candidate was her idiosyncratic foreign policy views. In 2022, she announced she was leaving the party, and she immediately formed a warm relationship with Fox News. She has evolved into a vociferous critic of Democrats and long been seen as a friend of the MAGA right. Thus, her joining Trump doesn’t come as a shock.  Kennedy’s journey is different, but it similarly clashes with the Democratic Party establishment. Despite his surname and a history of working as an environmental lawyer, he has long been at odds with prevailing norms among Democrats, liberals and even mainstream conservatives with his noncredible activism against vaccines. During the Covid pandemic, he became a superspreader of misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and influenced Republican talking points with his online messaging. When he threw his hat in the ring in the Democratic presidential primaries in April 2023, he did, surprisingly, garner the interest of a surprisingly large percentage of Democrats, sometimes receiving the support of up to 20% of Democratic voters. But before it could be established what percentage of that support owed to Biden fatigue and his name’s being Kennedy, he dropped out of the primaries and launched an independent campaign. Most of his time as a presidential candidate in the public eye has been defined by his appearances in the right-wing media ecosystem. It’s no surprise that, since last year, polling has shown that Republicans hold a more favorable view of him than Democrats do. In other words, neither Kennedy nor Gabbard is well-positioned to sell the story of how the Democratic Party left them. While both of them are idiosyncratic and hold views that don’t fit into one ideological category, their most salient, reputation-defining views in recent years haven’t had a significant audience in the Democratic Party. For a long time they’ve been seen as not quite belonging to that party. Their defections to Trump not only make sense but have recently even seemed probable. Will Trump benefit from his newest transition team members? Gabbard has a small, energetic online following, but she’s currently more of a pundit than a politician and has been seen as an adversary of the Democratic establishment long enough that it’s hard to see her moving the dial in any significant way. Kennedy, on the other hand, was putting up significant numbers with his independent presidential campaign until last week, and the behavior of his following remains an open question. After Vice President Kamala Harris entered the White House race, Kennedy’s support declined to around 5% in three-way matchups among Harris, Trump and Kennedy. It seemed clear he was more of a threat to Trump’s vote share than Harris’. But it’s hard to predict how persuasive Kennedy will be in persuading his supporters to cast their ballots for Trump. It is plausible that a significant proportion of his remaining die-hard followers were disinclined to ever vote for either of the two major parties. It’s also plausible that much of his support was never going to materialize at the ballot box since his campaign hinged on the idea of mistrust of American institutions. Instead of winning more independents, there’s even a chance Trump takes a ding among such voters for Kennedy’s most extreme views and for lending credence to the Democrats’ seemingly effective attack that the GOP is hobbled by weirdness and creepiness. Kennedy constantly makes news for an unrelenting stream of outlandish conspiracy theories and bizarre personal tales. He has offensively and falsely claimed that Covid was ""targeted"" to spare Chinese people and Jews. He has told stories about worms eating his brain and about leaving a dead bear cub in Central Park. It has recently resurfaced that in a 2012 magazine story, his daughter said her father once found a dead whale on a beach in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, used a chain saw to sever its head and then tied it to the roof of his car and (potentially illegally) drove it home to New York. In light of Kennedy’s official role in helping form a potential Trump administration, and in light of reporting that Kennedy and Trump have discussed whether he’d have a position in one, Democrats can now pin Kennedy’s strangeness and extremism onto Trump. Trump might ultimately benefit at the margins from Kennedy’s dropping out and joining his campaign. All signs indicate that this will be an extremely tight race, and so even a small share of votes that might’ve otherwise gone to Kennedy in a swing state could be of help to Trump. But it’s far from a slam dunk. (One additional wrinkle: Kennedy won’t be able to remove his name from ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan, and that fact could theoretically hurt Trump in those states with people looking for a protest vote option.) Ultimately, Gabbard and Kennedy aren’t sirens for Democrats, and Kennedy’s extremely odd behavior could be a liability for Trump."
166,"Trump, while reflecting on assassination attempt, puts blame on Biden and Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-dr-phil-interview-assassination-attempt-biden-harris-rcna168617,"Donald Trump said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are at fault “to a certain extent” for the attempt on his life last month in Pennsylvania, blaming them for security deficiencies even though the president and vice president have no involvement in Secret Service assignments. “He always made it very tough for us to have the proper number of Secret Service people,” Trump said about Biden in an interview with TV personality Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil. “When this happened, people would ask, whose fault is it? I think to a certain extent it’s Biden’s fault and Harris’ fault,” Trump added in the interview, which aired Tuesday. “And I’m the opponent. Look, they were weaponizing government against me, they brought in the whole DOJ to try and get me, they weren’t too interested in my health and safety.” Trump’s claim is entirely unfounded. The president and vice president are not involved in Secret Service assignments. The agency, which is funded by Congress, has faced a staffing shortage for years, as NBC News recently reported. A Secret Service official told NBC News that the shortfall has resulted in denials of requests for extra personnel for Trump over the past two years, but added that no such requests had been turned down for the rally where he was shot. On Wednesday, FBI officials told reporters that Trump’s would-be assassin had searched online for information about both of the major parties’ national conventions and that the former president’s July 13 rally in Pennsylvania appears to have been a “target of opportunity.” Trump’s comments escalate the tension in an already heated election year. Republicans have blamed the shooting on Democrats for calling Trump a threat to democracy after he has repeatedly vowed to tear through political norms and governmental systems of checks and balances. Analysts and experts have said that the surge of violent threats against election officials is in part motivated by Trump’s own vengeful rhetoric toward those he perceives as enemies. In the interview, Trump spoke at length about the rally shooting. McGraw also appeared to egg him on, asking: “I’m not saying that they [Biden and Harris] wanted you to get shot, but do you think it was OK with them if you did?” “I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know,” Trump responded. “There’s a lot of hatred. I don’t know why. I had a great presidency.” At one point, the former president suggested that he may have survived the shooting because God wants him to save the world. “If I win that [the election], that would really serve to say that there’s some incredible power up there that wanted me to be involved — and maybe it’s more than saving the nation, maybe it’s saving the world,” Trump said."
167,Trump is borrowing an old GOP tactic on abortion — with one key difference,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-29 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-reproductive-rights-truth-social-abortion-rcna168309,"On Friday, Donald Trump declared that his administration would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” The Truth Social post immediately drew the ire of anti-abortion leaders and the mockery of commentators supportive of abortion rights, who noted that in an interview the day before, Trump had also repeated his now familiar (and false) line that all Americans wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. Trump is trying to have it both ways. And while this strategy may not exactly be working at the moment, history can help us understand his bigger goal — and whether it will work in the longer term. Clearly, Trump and many in the GOP are aware that the reversal of Roe remains unpopular. And Republicans’ attempts to appear more moderate may seem novel, given how recently politicians like JD Vance boasted about their pro-life bona fides. But in reality, just a few decades ago mainstream Republicans were already trying hard to appease both sides of the debate. Ronald Reagan was the first GOP presidential nominee to fully embrace the anti-abortion movement, believing not that most Americans opposed legal abortion but that his position could help the GOP win over socially conservative Catholics and Democrats who might have voted Democratic for economic reasons. In 1976, the GOP platform adopted at the Republican National Convention had taken a muddy position on abortion; in 1980, Reagan ran on a platform that embraced an amendment to the Constitution to protect fetal rights. But by the late 1980s and early 1990s, GOP leaders were having second thoughts. Lee Atwater, George H.W. Bush’s campaign manager, often stated publicly that anti-abortion positions were unpopular and stressed that the GOP was a “big tent” that could accommodate those with a range of positions on reproductive rights. With Atwater’s encouragement, Ann Stone, the ex-wife of Trumpworld insider Roger Stone, launched Republicans for Choice in 1990 to organize these efforts. This move was blunted by the success of firebrand Pat Buchanan during the 1992 GOP primary, however. Buchanan fared better than expected in several key contests, winning himself a prime slot at the GOP national convention, where he railed against abortion and women working outside the home. Republicans had considered changing their platform at the 1992 Republican National Convention to leave out demands for a fetal personhood amendment. But Bush ultimately veered back to the right on the issue. The whiplash continued. After autopsies of the race established that the abortion issue had hurt George H.W. Bush, the effort to make the GOP a “big tent” regained momentum. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader and GOP standard bearer in 1996, wanted to push a more moderate line. He called on his party to condemn a specific procedure performed in the second trimester that abortion opponents called “partial-birth abortion.” At the same time, Dole promoted a pledge of tolerance welcoming those into the GOP with a wide variety of views on personhood, especially those who considered themselves pro-choice. But Dole lost that November to President Bill Clinton, and abortion opponents argued that his position on abortion had watered down the enthusiasm of his own base. President George W. Bush won two elections at a time when abortion rights seemed secure. His father, by contrast, lost an election at precisely the time many Americans had first expected Roe to be overturned. By that point, Reagan and the elder Bush — both of whom had called for the reversal of Roe — had nominated a majority of the justices then on the Supreme Court. And more tellingly, in 1989, the Supreme Court had issued a major decision openly criticizing Roe. This election season, Trump has borrowed from strategies that the GOP once used to undercut Democrats’ advantage on abortion. Like his predecessors, Trump and other Republicans have spotlighted abortions later in pregnancy, presuming them to be more unpopular. The 2024 GOP platform omitted any mention of a fetal-personhood constitutional amendment and praised IVF. And as mentioned earlier, Trump himself has used the language of “reproductive rights,” suggesting that he, too, wants to build a big tent. But look closer, and it is clear that Trump is doing something different. Advocates like Atwater or Stone might generally have supported some abortion rights — or felt the need to change the GOP’s position to remain electorally relevant. (Welcoming pro-abortion voters into the tent, in theory, would necessitate a political pivot.) With Trump, it’s far less clear that this is the case. After all, Trump never defined what he meant by “reproductive rights,” and has claimed baselessly that Americans never wanted a right to abortion in the first place. This despite polls dating back to before Roe’s reversal show that more than half of Americans did not want it to be reversed. It certainly seems possible that Trump’s definition of reproductive rights could actually exclude the right to an abortion. This confusion is par for the course with Trump. His platform, for example, nodded to the theory that the Fourteenth Amendment already recognized fetal personhood, and members of the platform committee insisted that it was for this reason that there was no longer a need to mention a specific personhood amendment. Trump has said that he supports the Supreme Court’s recent ruling preserving access to the abortion pill mifepristone yet also suggested that he was open to prohibiting mifepristone access. And recently, when stating that he would not enforce the Comstock Act, a nineteenth-century obscenity law some conservatives would love used to ban abortion, Trump made clear that the specifics had yet to be worked out, and that his commitment not to enforce the law, such as it was, applied only “generally.” The upshot, it seems, is that Trump wants both anti-abortion voters and supporters of abortion rights to vote for him without offering either one much of anything. Trump’s obfuscation has angered anti-abortion leaders with reason — it suggests that he has taken their voters for granted. And Trump has embraced talk of reproductive rights while reiterating how happy he is that the Supreme Court overturned the biggest safeguard to those rights. Trump is not the first Republican to try to walk a fine line on abortion. But he may be the first GOP presidential candidate to try to totally redefine the concept of reproductive rights in a bid to soften his rhetoric without having to actually soften any of his policy stances."
168,Project 2025 would enable Donald Trump's worst instincts as commander in chief,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 14:18:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/donald-trump-veterans-military-project-2025-rcna168665,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Aug. 27 episode of ""The ReidOut."" Now that Donald Trump is trying to get elected again, he’s pretending to care about America’s military service members and veterans — or at least trying to get you to forget all the ways he’s denigrated them.  This weekend marked six years since Vietnam War hero Sen. John McCain died. It also marks six years since Trump had to be shamed into releasing a formal statement on the senator’s passing. Trump’s pettiness in the wake of McCain’s death is just one example of his pattern of disrespect for America’s military. He has reportedly called fallen soldiers “losers and suckers” and told aides he didn’t want to see disabled veterans at events. He recently said the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest presidential civilian award, is better since recipients of the Medal of Honor, the highest military award, are either dead or have combat wounds. He’s also denigrated the generals who’ve served under him, suggesting the execution of the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and calling his former White House chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly “stupid.” Now, another general who served under Trump, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster,  is giving his inside account of the former president's chaos. In a new book, McMaster writes about how Russian dictator Vladimir Putin manipulated Trump by playing to his “ego and insecurities with flattery.” McMaster also says Trump set the stage for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 by entering into negotiations with the Taliban. Trump's threats to our country's military aren't just in the past. If he wins a second term, Trump has expansive and draconian plans for the military. He’s already plotting to fire top military leaders who don’t share his vision — an idea straight out of Project 2025: Firing top officers is one of many ways Project 2025 seeks to rebuild a military it refers to as “Barack Obama’s general officer corps.” In addition to calling for firing and freezing promotions for generals, Project 2025 also wants to rebuild and retrain the military. It would require all public schools to administer the military entrance exam for recruitment. The document also calls for the reinstatement of active-duty members who refused Covid vaccines and restoring their rank. Project 2025 pushes for abolishing diversity, equity and inclusion offices and staff — ostensibly to make the military whiter and reduce women’s roles. It also calls to expand support for the Department of Homeland Security’s border protection operations. In plain English, that means deputizing the military to round up migrants.  It’s clear Project 2025 would enable Trump’s worst instincts when it comes to his role as commander in chief. The prospect of handing the reins of our military back over to him should terrify us all.

Kennedy Jr. will not be able to remove his name from the ballots in Wisconsin and in Michigan, two crucial battleground states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hoping will deliver them a decisive win in November. Kennedy suspended his independent bid for president last week and promptly endorsed Trump. Polls had shown that Kennedy was more likely to gain support among Republicans than among Democrats, and the suspension of his presidential campaign was seen as more beneficial to Trump than to Harris. In remarks to his supporters on Friday, Kennedy said he was not formally ending his campaign and that he intends to remain on the ballot in states where he poses little to no threat of splitting the vote with the GOP nominee. But in Michigan and Wisconsin, where polls have been running close, Kennedy has now been barred from removing himself from ballots. In Michigan, where Kennedy was nominated as the Natural Law Party's candidate, a spokesperson for the secretary of state's office told NBC News that minor-party candidates cannot withdraw their nominations. The Wisconsin Election Commission on Tuesday also declined Kennedy's request to take his name off the ballot; Ann Jacobs, who chairs the commission, said that state law does not permit a qualified candidate who has filed nomination papers to decline nomination, NBC News reported. Still, Kennedy's insistence on remaining on ballots in non-swing states may speak to a need to prove that his candidacy, no matter how little it is resonating, has appeal. Days after Kennedy suspended his campaign, Kentucky's secretary of state said he had filed on Monday to run for president in the state and will appear on the ballot in November."
170,"Looking for cash, Trump combines two of his money-making schemes",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 09:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/looking-cash-trump-combines-two-money-making-schemes-rcna168626,"Shortly before Christmas 2022, Donald Trump raised a few eyebrows with an item published to his social media platform. “AMERICA NEEDS A SUPERHERO!” the former president wrote. “I will be making a MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT tomorrow. Thank you!” Ample speculation soon followed, but few guessed what the Republican would unveil a day later: The “official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection.” For “only” $99 each, his customers could buy non-fungible tokens, which the candidate described as “very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.” This was, to be sure, high on the list of Trump’s cringeworthy money-making schemes, alongside an unrelated pitch that came a year later when the former president sold off pieces of the suit he said he wore while taking his mug shot after one of his criminal indictments. This week, believe it or not, the GOP candidate managed to combine the two schemes. The Hill reported: Describing his latest money-making scheme in an online video, Trump said: “It’s really something” — a sentiment that was easy to agree with, though not for the reasons he had in mind. Part of what makes this striking is the degree to which Trump released a video of himself that made him look like a two-bit carnival huckster. Just as notably, I’ve never seen a candidate for the nation’s highest office do something like this during a presidential campaign. In fact, it’s important to emphasize that the Republican nominee isn’t doing this to get contributions, because the money apparently won’t benefit his 2024 operation. This is about Trump looking for money to put in his pocket, not his coffers. But let’s also not lose sight of the larger pattern. The gold sneakers. The Trump-endorsed Bible. The fake university. The board game. The steaks. We’re talking about a politician who appears to meander from one get-rich-quick opportunity to the next, without much regard for merit or dignity. It’s not a secret that the Republican’s finances are a mess, and a recent Washington Post analysis added, “He is in a cash crunch — personally and politically — and has been unafraid throughout his career to put the Trump name on anything that might yield a stream of revenue.” When it comes to someone seeking the White House, that’s ... not ideal."
171,What Jack Smith’s changes tell us about his Jan. 6 case against Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 09:38:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jack-smith-trump-indictment-changes-jan-6-supreme-court-rcna168525,"Just over a year ago, special counsel Jack Smith indicted former President Donald Trump over his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. There was a bit of déjà vu then on Tuesday when Smith revealed that he had obtained a superseding indictment against Trump, keeping the same four charges in place but with the backing of a different federal grand jury. When comparing the version that was handed up on Tuesday with the original from last year, the changes appear to be focused on deconflicting the charges against Trump with the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on the matter. Smith opted against the most cautious approach he could have taken, stripping the case down to its essence to fully bulletproof it from further Supreme Court intervention. Instead, he has chosen to attempt the strongest case available against Trump within the fetters that the court has now placed on him. The most obvious changes relate to the court’s sweeping decision in Trump v. United States. Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion found that all presidents, including Trump, have absolute immunity from criminal charges for exercising their “core Constitutional duties.” Roberts specifically cited Trump’s communications with the Justice Department — in which he tried to force the DOJ to back his false election claims — as off-limits for prosecution. Smith has complied accordingly, deleting the entirety of the DOJ evidence from the indictment’s narrative, along with any references to Justice Department officials pushing back on his lies about mass voter fraud. Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark is no longer an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator. Also gone are any references to the White House counsel and most references to any conversations Trump might have had with people on his staff within the executive branch. Beyond the absolute immunity for a president’s core duties, Roberts also ruled that there is “presumptive immunity” for things that fall within the scope of the president’s “remaining official actions.” It now falls to Smith to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan which of Trump’s actions were “unofficial” and thus beyond the reach of this presumed immunity — but he is blocked from being able to use “official acts” as evidence to make the case for why immunity should not be granted. The special counsel has accepted that challenge with gusto. In the new indictment, Smith carefully makes clear why many of the steps Trump and his allies took were in no way part of the president’s job. Nowhere is that more evident than when it comes to Trump’s pressure campaign against former Vice President Mike Pence. After numerous other avenues had failed, Trump leaned on Pence to simply declare him the winner when presiding over the electoral vote count on Jan. 6, 2021. The opinion in Trump v. U.S. hinted that those conversations between the president and vice president might fall within the scope of presumptive immunity, but Smith didn’t mince words in disagreeing: Moreover, Smith takes great pains to emphasize how many of the people acting on Trump’s behalf did so in the name of his presidential campaign, not his presidency. There are still six unindicted co-conspirators listed in the document, he writes, “none of whom were government officials during the conspiracies and all of whom were acting in a private capacity.” The new indictment also addresses the role of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has attempted to use his former position as cover from being investigated or indicted. Smith now clarifies that Meadows “sometimes handled private and Campaign-related logistics for the Defendant” when describing Trump’s now infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Interestingly, the new indictment’s edits also appear to consider a second Supreme Court ruling as well. A few days before the decision in Trump v. U.S., the court ruled in Fischer v. United States, which considered the Justice Department’s use of a federal statute on obstructing an official proceeding. Roughly a quarter of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged under Section 1512(c)(2) for their role in disrupting the counting of electoral votes, according to the Justice Department. There was concern when the case was being adjudicated that the court might entirely invalidate two of the four charges against Trump. The 6-3 decision did narrow the scope of the law in question but did so in a way that let the charges against the former president stand. Roberts, again the author of the majority opinion, wrote that prosecutors must now show that defendants “impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so.” In the new indictment, Smith’s team has done just that. When describing the actual events of the Jan. 6 attack, the new version adds in more details about Congress’ work that day to certify the Electoral College’s votes, focusing on the documents that the rioters threatened after breaching the Capitol. With that shift, the prosecution now also highlights the timing of the attack and its aim of disrupting the vote count. “At approximately 1:11 p.m., the Vice President opened the certificates of vote and certificates of ascertainment that the legitimate electors for the state of Arizona had mailed to Washington, consistent with the [Electoral Count Act],” the indictment now reads. Two paragraphs later, having noted that Trump was back in the White House watching events unfold, the prosecution describes the Capitol being breached and forcing the Senate to recess. “At approximately 2:20 p.m., the official proceeding having been interrupted, staffers evacuating from the Senate carried with them the electors’ certificates of vote and their governors’ certificates of ascertainment,” Smith wrote. The superseding indictment is not guaranteed to kickstart the trial, which was originally scheduled to begin this past March. There are still several elements that will require Chutkan to rule on whether they can be included in his arguments. Trump’s lawyers are most likely to object to the prosecution’s references to his conversations with Pence, arguing that those discussions were within the scope of his office. But they may wind up throwing whatever they can into their filing to attempt to delay the proceedings further. And, thanks to the vagueness of the immunity test that Roberts put forward, whatever ruling Chutkan makes will likely be appealed. The matter may even make its way back up to the Supreme Court, as I predicted previously, giving the conservative justices another chance to cover for Trump. But Smith has done a lot of the heavy lifting to ensure that, should Trump lose in November, this case can continue forward into the next administration."
172,The brutal reality of Trump's mass deportation plan needs to be discussed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 08:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mass-deportation-plan-rcna168431,"Donald Trump still loves a border wall, so much so that he’ll even do a photo-op in front of one built during his predecessor Barack Obama’s administration. But as a policy promise and a symbol of what can be expected from a future Trump presidency, the wall has been replaced in favor of a program of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. The organizers of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month even printed signs reading “MASS DEPORTATION NOW!” for delegates to wave with glee. The idea has an understandable if vulgar appeal: If people are here illegally, just make them leave. If that’s unpleasant for them, it’s no more than they deserve for violating immigration laws. But if we consider what would be involved in mass deportation, it becomes clear that Trump is promising something that’s shocking in its brutality, overwhelming in its logistical challenge and unprecedented — not only in American history, but in the history of the world.  On NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday, host Kristen Welker asked Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, about the millions of families of mixed status, in which at least one parent is undocumented but a spouse or a child is a legal resident or a citizen. Would families simply be broken up? After dodging the question a few times while claiming he was eager to answer it, Vance finally said, “I think you of course have a number of children who are currently living with drug cartel members, not actually their families.” That’s not exactly reassuring to those families that a Trump administration would treat them as something other than criminals. Asked the same question about family separation three days before, Trump said only, “We’ll work on that,” which means he hasn’t given it any thought. As for how the mass deportation of undocumented people would work, he offered a predictably simple-minded explanation: “We’ll work with locals — and they’re going to bring them to us — and we’ll get them over the border, and we’ll make arrangements with the countries, and the countries will accept them back, and if they don’t accept them back, we do no trade with those countries, and we charge them big tariffs.” Bada-bing, bada-boom. All taken care of.  When Trump talks about mass deportation, he speaks as if every undocumented immigrant’s name and address are on a list and law enforcement can just knock on their doors and politely remove them. But the reality is far different. The most widely accepted number for the undocumented population is 11 million, though that is an approximation (Trump and other Republicans claim it’s twice as high or more). How is the government going to find and remove 11 million people if it doesn’t know who they are? Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws within the interior of the country, made 416,000 arrests last year; the agency clearly doesn’t have anything near the resources to arrest 26 times as many people. In fact, according to FBI statistics, every law enforcement agency in America — every police department and sheriff’s department, every state police troop, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and so on — combine to make about 10 million arrests per year. So even if you recruited every law enforcement official in the country to this effort, you’d be doubling their workload, and they still wouldn’t reach every undocumented resident.  Trump says he wants to deploy the military to do the job. And how would that work? Would soldiers descend on states and cities with large immigrant populations and go house to house demanding that everyone show their papers? I can remember when Republicans were the ones warning about “jack-booted government thugs” deploying “Gestapo tactics.” They might show up at workplaces where they suspect significant numbers of undocumented people are working, but such raids are usually rare and planned far in advance. Once they line up, say, a hundred workers outside a factory, how would those workers prove their legal status? A birth certificate or a passport is necessary to prove citizenship, and how many people take one of those documents to work every day? Would the military just arrest everyone with an accent and sort them out later? Legal residents and U.S. citizens would inevitably be wrongly arrested in huge numbers before they could prove their status, if they ever did, in what would be unlikely to be a smoothly run operation (this is a Trump enterprise, don’t forget). And where would you put the millions who’d been rounded up while this process of figuring out who is and isn’t a legal resident played out? Ghoulish Trump adviser Stephen Miller envisions vast camps near the southern border; just imagine dumping people there by the hundreds of thousands at a time and what it would take to provide food, shelter and sanitation for them.   Immigrants, including those who are undocumented, live in almost every state, county and city in America. Arresting this many of them would be chaotic, terrifying and often violent. Think of how you’d react if someone busted into your house and tried to take members of your family away. Basic civil rights would be violated on a scale unprecedented in American history. About 120,000 Japanese Americans were placed in internment camps during World War II, a program we now properly regard as abominable, and that was about one-one hundredth of the size of what Trump proposes.  In fact, no country has ever removed 11 million people from within its territory; to find roundups on anything even approaching that scale, you have to look to the history of genocide in places such as Germany and Cambodia.  That’s not to mention the economic consequences of mass deportation. Like it or not, undocumented people not only do critical work in a variety of industries including farming, construction and food production; they also pay billions of dollars in taxes every year. As one recent review of economic literature on the subject concluded, mass deportation “would shrink the U.S. economy, cause American workers to lose jobs, reduce the wages of U.S. citizens, lose the taxes paid by deported unauthorized immigrants and worsen the finances of federal, state and local governments.” Trump’s mass deportation plan is his most consequential economic promise, far more than cutting taxes or increasing tariffs, and it would be an economic disaster.  Perhaps Trump’s mass deportation would be akin to his promise to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it: something that was never going to happen the way he described it but which thrilled his supporters all the same. They love to imagine Trump snapping his fingers like Thanos and making all the undocumented immigrants disappear, without muss or fuss. Yet for all his rancid white nationalism, Trump couldn’t make immigrants disappear, as hard as he tried. This is still a country where immigrants are an essential part of our economic and cultural life, just as they have always been. We can’t know whether Trump believes what he says, but his people are certainly acting like they’re serious. “Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” his former ICE director Tom Homan said in July. “They ain’t seen s--- yet. Wait until 2025.” Even if Trump can’t accomplish what he promises, he’s likely at the very least to attempt some form of it. And we all ought to be afraid."
173,"The worst part of Trump’s reaction to new, superseding indictment",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 07:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/worst-part-trumps-reaction-new-superseding-indictment-rcna168587,"It was about a year ago when Donald Trump was initially indicted over his efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat. It’s a case that was delayed by a series of procedural appeals, culminating in a scandalous U.S. Supreme Court ruling that, to a radical degree, elevates the American presidency above the law. That ruling, of course, was issued by Republican-appointed justices last month. This month, as my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained, special counsel Jack Smith and his team decided it was time for a new indictment related to the same underlying crimes. In other words, the GOP nominee is still being charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, but the charges are now being presented in such a way as to accommodate the Republican-appointed justices’ opinion. “The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions,” the special counsel’s office said in the filing. For the most part, the criminal defendant responded as expected. Trump began, for example, by turning to his donors, seeking a reward for the grand jury’s findings. (The subject line in the appeal: “I was just indicted again!”) The Republican has long tested the “crime doesn’t pay” adage, and it was hardly surprising to see him do so again. Around the same time, the former president turned to his social media platform to issue a furious tirade about the charges, Smith, and the efforts to hold him accountable. Trump then issued another such statement. Then another. And then another. About an hour later, however, Trump rolled out a different kind of complaint. “It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election — but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote. “Voting starts on September 6th, therefore the DOJ has violated its own policy — Election Interference.” So, a couple of things. First, Election Day 2024 is 69 days away. Yes, some states allow early voting that will begin much sooner, but Trump’s attempted “gotcha” probably won’t amount to much. Indeed, as Lawfare's Anna Bower explained, prosecutors explained in a March court hearing that the judge that the “60-day rule” does not apply to cases like Trump’s ""that have already been charged and are now in the hands of the judicial system.""  Second, it’s kind of hilarious to see the Republican take a sudden interest in a DOJ rule he was eager to ignore four years ago. In October 2020 — 30 days before Election Day, with early voting already underway across much of the country — Trump publicly called on federal prosecutors to charge Joe Biden, accusing him of undefined crimes. In fact, on Oct. 7, 2020 — 31 days before Election Day — Politico published an especially memorable headline: “‘Where are all of the arrests?’: Trump demands Barr lock up his foes.” The next day, the then-Republican incumbent spoke with Fox Business and called on the Justice Department to “indict” his perceived Democratic foes — including Biden. In other words, when Smith’s office issues a superseding indictment 70 days before Election Day 2024, before early voting begins in any state, Trump sees it as proof of “election interference” and a violation of Justice Department policy. But when Trump was in office, he nevertheless expected the DOJ to charge his Democratic opponent with made-up crimes much closer to Election Day 2020. How does the former president explain the contradiction? So far, by ignoring it."
174,Why Trump’s new commitment to pardons for Jan. 6 rioters matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 07:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-commitment-pardons-jan-6-rioters-matters-rcna164670,"Donald Trump has spent much of the campaign season lying uncontrollably about the Jan. 6 attack he instigated, and at the former president’s latest rally in Pennsylvania, the Republican kept the assault on reality going. Trump repeated a familiar lie about Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, he lied again about his Jan. 6 crowd size, and he rewrote history by claiming that some of his followers “walked peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol.” As part of the same remarks, Trump also falsely accused members of the Jan. 6 committee of “deleting and destroying” evidence that would’ve made him appear innocent. But as exasperating as these false claims were, the more important rhetoric came a few hours earlier, during Trump’s disastrous appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists. The New York Times reported: As difficult as this might be to believe, ABC News anchor Rachel Scott reminded the Republican of the extensive injuries to police officers during the insurrectionist violence, including an officer who lost an eye. She asked whether the rioters who clashed with those officers are “patriots” who “deserve pardons.”Trump initially responded by ignoring the question and talking about protesters spray-painting limestone at the Capitol last week. So Scott tried again, asking whether he’s prepared to pardon “rioters who assaulted police officers.” The GOP nominee replied, “Oh, absolutely. If they’re innocent, I’d pardon them.” When Scott noted that they were talking about criminals who’ve already been convicted, Trump added that they were “convicted by a very, very tough system” — as if that somehow left open the possibility that the violent rioters, some of whom pleaded guilty, might still be innocent and deserving of presidential pardons.This was, as a Politico report noted, “the most explicit promise Trump has made about the range of defendants he might spring from prison if he takes office — a group that now appears to include some of the most notoriously violent actors that day.” Quite right. As regular readers might recall, it was in mid-March when the former president declared that pardoning “the January 6 Hostages,” whom he said were being “wrongfully imprisoned,” would be among his “first acts” upon returning to the White House. Less than a week later, Trump offered some additional clarity to his plan: Jan. 6 rioters could expect pardons on “the first day” of his second term. According to those on the former president’s team, Jan. 6 pardons would be considered on a case-by-case basis — the idea being that Trump would exercise at least some caution and wouldn’t simply pardon everyone convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol. But the presumptive GOP nominee himself apparently has a different perspective on this. When Trump sat down with Time magazine’s Eric Cortellessa in the spring, the reporter reminded him that more than 800 Jan. 6 participants have been sentenced through our judicial system and most of them pleaded guilty. Others were convicted by juries. “Will you consider pardoning every one of them?” Cortellessa asked. “I would consider that, yes,” Trump replied. Apparently surprised, the Time reporter added, “Really?” to which the Republican said, “Yes, absolutely.” (He went on to share some related and bizarre ideas about the police “ushering” rioters into the Capitol, and a nefarious “they” who “destroyed” evidence that would’ve made him look better.) As an NBC News report added soon after, Trump was referring to Jan. 6 defendants “caught on tape brandishing or using firearms, stun guns, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bike racks, batons, a metal whip, office furniture, pepper spray, bear spray, a tomahawk ax, a hatchet, a hockey stick, knuckle gloves, a baseball bat, a massive ‘Trump’ billboard, ‘Trump’ flags, a pitchfork, pieces of lumber, crutches and even an explosive device during the brutal attack that injured about 140 police officers.”It was two years ago when the Republican first broached this subject, telling a Tennessee audience that he would look “very, very seriously” at pardoning those who were arrested for Jan. 6 crimes. For emphasis, he added, “very, very seriously.” Twenty-five months later, his position on the rioters, whom he’s labeled “J-6 patriots,” is far more radical — to the point that Trump is now the first major-party presidential candidate in the history of American politics to run on a platform that effectively says, “Vote for me and I’ll deliberately release violent criminals back onto the streets.” As we’ve discussed, it’s also important to acknowledge the broader circumstances. In the weeks, months and years that followed the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, federal prosecutors got to work charging rioters, not just because they committed crimes, and not just to hold them accountable, but also to prevent future attacks. The message was intended to be clear: The United States prosecuted these insurrectionists, so those thinking about following in their footsteps should expect to face legal consequences, too. Trump intends to silence that message, undo what’s been done and make clear that criminals who ignore the law in his name need not worry about accountability. There is arguably no greater example of the Republican’s hostility toward the rule of law. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
175,"As JD Vance flounders, Trump does surprisingly little to help",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 06:46:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-flounders-donald-trump-surprisingly-little-help-election-2024-rcna164655,"The Wall Street Journal asked Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer this week about Donald Trump choosing Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. “Well, it’s too late to rethink it,” the North Dakotan responded. It’s been that kind of rollout for the GOP’s vice-presidential nominee. “I’ll bet President Trump is sitting there scratching his head and wondering, 'why did I pick this guy?'” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CBS News a few days ago. “The choice may be one of the best things he ever did for Democrats.” Just as importantly, quite a few Republicans have also struggled to pretend that they’re satisfied with the former president’s current running mate. The larger question remains, however, what Trump thinks of his choice. As it turns out, Vance was a topic of conversation during the Republican’s disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists’ conference. USA Today reported: The line of inquiry couldn’t have been more straightforward. “When you look at JD Vance, is he ready on Day One?” Faulkner asked. What Trump should have said was, “Of course he is. I wouldn’t have chosen him for my ticket if I wasn’t certain he could assume the presidency in the event of a crisis.” But instead of saying that, Trump instead argued that his running mate just isn’t that important. “Historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” the former president said. “I mean, virtually no impact. ... Virtually never has it mattered.” Remember, the question was whether his running mate would be ready to lead in January. Instead of answering directly, Trump effectively said that his running mate just isn’t that important. As part of the same appearance, he was also asked about Vance’s contempt for American couples without children, and Trump didn’t exactly have compelling answers on this, either. It’s been difficult to keep up with the recent reporting featuring the words “Vance” and “buyers’ remorse,” which helps explain why the Ohio senator begins his national effort with a negative favorability rating — a rarity for any modern running mate. Trump’s latest comments almost certainly won’t help. Trump “has a choice,” Schumer added this past weekend. “Does he keep Vance on the ticket, where he already has a whole lot of baggage ... or does he pick someone new?” Such talk is almost certainly premature, though I have a hunch the New York Democrat won’t be the last prominent political figure to ask such a question."
176,"At NABJ event, Trump lights his outreach to Black voters on fire",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nabj-event-trump-lights-outreach-black-voters-fire-rcna164640,"It probably seemed like a good idea at the time. The National Association of Black Journalists extended an invitation to Donald Trump to appear at their convention, creating an opportunity for the organization to raise its visibility, and offering NABJ professionals an opportunity to hear directly from a man who might soon become president. The Republican nominee, meanwhile, accepted the invitation, hoping to reach an audience beyond his far-right base. What could possibly go wrong? Before the former president even took the stage, problems emerged. As my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones explained, “The organization faced a deluge of denunciations from journalists and activists after it announced it would give a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the free press, spread racist propaganda and repeatedly insulted Black journalists. In fact, NABJ has issued several statements in recent years denouncing Trump’s illiberal behavior and attacks on its members.” But after the GOP nominee actually started speaking, Trump not only made matters far worse, he also validated the concerns of those who warned the NABJ that it was making a mistake by giving him a platform in the first place. NBC News reported: To be sure, Trump’s appearance at the convention was a train wreck for a variety of reasons. His rhetoric about “Black jobs,” for example, was a mess. He similarly went out of his way to be as insulting and condescending as possible to some of the Black women who asked him good and fair questions. As is usually the case, he also lied — a lot — about matters large and small. But it was Trump’s comments about Harris’ race and ethnicity that were jaw-dropping. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic vice president. “And she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” In case that wasn’t quite enough, the Republican added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and ... she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that, too.” Trump concluded, “Is she Indian or is she Black?” The unscripted comments were obviously racist. They were also sadly predictable given Trump’s lengthy record of overt racism. What's more, as a New York Times analysis added, “The audacity of Mr. Trump, a white man, questioning how much a Black woman truly belongs to Black America was particularly incendiary. ... [I]t evoked an ugly history in this country, in which white America has often declared the racial categories that define citizens, and sought to determine who gets to call themselves what.” The idea that Harris — who is both Indian American and Black — could have a multifaceted racial and ethnic background is apparently intolerable to the Republican candidate. Trump expects voters to believe that the vice president “happened to turn Black,” which is every bit as wrong and offensive as it seems. Team Trump developed a plan to go after the likely Democratic nominee. Having Trump question Harris’ identity, while insisting that she “obviously” doesn’t “respect” her Indian and Black heritage, was not part of that plan. Indeed, it didn’t come as too big of a surprise when the former president’s aides pulled the plug on the appearance and Trump left the stage before the end of his scheduled appearance — though he continued to go after Harris’ identity in the hours that followed the event. In a normal and healthy political environment, in a normal and healthy political party, this was the sort of appearance that might very well end a candidacy. The larger question isn’t whether Trump is relying on racism — again — to advance his quest for power, because the answer is obvious. Rather, the question is why in the world would he put on this racist display while appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention. Let’s not forget that for much of the year, the Republican and his team seemed determined to improve their showing with Black voters. What’s more, there was some polling evidence that suggested those efforts were paying off, and Trump was poised to fare better in communities of color in 2024 than any other modern GOP nominee. But if that was a priority for Team Trump when it was facing President Joe Biden, it’s no longer a priority now. What the public saw at Wednesday’s event was a candidate who had a plan for reaching out to Black voters, and then set that plan on fire. In fact, it’s easy to believe that those in attendance at the NABJ event were not the intended audience at all. As The Washington Post’s Colbert I. King summarized in his latest column, “As offensive as all that was to the Black men and women staring in his direction, Trump knew it was getting a belly laugh with his crowd, who can’t get enough of that stuff.” Common sense suggests Trump did not earn any support on Wednesday from communities of color, but by all appearances, they weren’t the intended audience for his offensive antics."
177,Trump gave another reason why he’s too old to run for president,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-01 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-too-old-president-age-harris-nabj-rcna164613,"In a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken after the presidential debate in June, 86% of Americans said President Joe Biden was too old to serve a second term. This survey and similar findings played an essential role in Biden’s decision to depart the presidential race, directly rebutting the president’s contention that only donors and media elites wanted him not to run. Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum since entering the race, while running on a platform almost identical to Biden’s, has only confirmed the depth of voters’ concerns about the president’s age. And yet since Biden dropped out, it has been largely forgotten that many voters are also rightly concerned about Donald Trump’s age. In the same Post/ABC poll, 60% of Americans, including 65% of independents, said Trump is too old for another term. But apart from a few initial articles and some jabs on social media, the question of Trump’s age has largely been forgotten. To be sure, Harris’ campaign is busy introducing her to voters. And in the wake of Trump’s naming JD Vance as his running mate, Democrats have delighted in pointing out that the MAGA movement’s leaders are somewhere between weird and straight-up creepy. But there’s still nearly 100 days left until Election Day — plenty of time to return to the issue. Even if some media outlets seem curiously incurious about age since Biden stepped aside, Trump’s age remains a serious issue. Should the 78-year-old Trump win in November, he would be older upon taking office than Biden was when he took office in 2021. Trump has a history of heart disease yet habitually releases medical records lacking any useful details. His personal physician when he first ran for president later admitted Trump outright dictated the memo declaring that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” In 2020, he and his team hid the seriousness of his Covid infection from the public. His assurances of his cognitive and physical health amount to “trust me.” Four years in the White House did not age Trump as much as other presidents — perhaps because he spent less scheduled time working than any other president. But time comes for everyone, and Trump is no exception. Even a cursory contrast between Trump’s first and third runs for the presidency shows him clearly diminished from his initial campaign. His tendency to ramble has only grown, and the confident bluster of 2016 has given way to exhaustion. He loses track of his thoughts mid-sentence or even mid-word. He asks his supporters to vote 24 hours after asking them not to vote. He mixes up names with increasing frequency, confusing Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley and Biden with Barack Obama. He even struggled to keep his eyes open at his Manhattan criminal trial this year. And Trump’s own staff knows his struggles. Just as Biden’s staff increasingly limited the president’s media and public appearances until June’s debate left it with no choice, so has Trump’s staff largely kept him confined to friendly venues. In his first two runs for the presidency, Trump frequently sat down with a wide range of media. This time around, he has stuck largely to Fox News and other such outlets. Trump’s disastrous appearance Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention showed exactly why his staff has built that bubble. Afterwards, at a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., Trump tried a new way to parse the issue. “81 is not old,” he insisted. “But [Biden] is a bad 81.” (In the same rally, he referred to Senate candidate Dave McCormick as Pennsylvania’s “future governor.”) The former president’s new excuse is further confirmation that voters’ concerns about Trump’s age should not be forgotten. Yes, if Democrats bring it up, they will be accused of being hypocrites after having long rejected calls for Biden to step aside. But in the end, they acceded to voters’ wishes — and reality. The concern about Trump’s age is no less legitimate. The presidency is an incredibly difficult job, requiring long hours, quick decisions and extraordinary focus. Those requirements have not changed since Biden dropped out."
178,Why Trump’s ‘incident’ at Arlington National Cemetery matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 06:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-incident-arlington-national-cemetery-matters-rcna168577,"In modern American politics, the vast majority of officials in both parties have taken care to treat the military, service members and veterans with respect. Donald Trump, for reasons that defy comprehension, has chosen a radically different path. Over the last decade or so, the Republican has reportedly denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as “suckers.” (He denies doing so.) Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, reportedly disparaged wounded veterans, blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, downplayed the importance of traumatic brain injuries suffered by soldiers, feuded with Gold Star families, downplayed the significance of the Medal of Honor, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, “I like people that weren’t captured, okay?” But a different aspect of his disrespect for those who wear the uniform was on display this week. Despite his record, the former president, seeing a possible campaign opportunity, appeared eager on Monday to exploit the third anniversary of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 150 Afghans. This included attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, quickly followed by a thumbs-up photo-op at a gravestone in Section 60 of the cemetery, where many service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. If we were to stop the story here, it would already be the basis for a legitimate controversy. Indeed, Esquire published a memorable headline alongside a Charles P. Pierce column this week: “How The Hell Was Trump Allowed To Use Arlington National Cemetery As A Campaign Prop?” But that was before the story managed to get even worse. NBC News reported: The details of what transpired are still coming together. NPR reported, for example, that a source familiar said two members of Trump’s campaign staff “had a verbal and physical altercation” with an official at Arlington National Cemetery, but that hasn't been independently confirmed by MSNBC or NBC News. Other relevant details, however, are clear. “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,” the statement added. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.” I’m mindful of the fact that multiple reports emphasized that Trump was at the cemetery at the invitation of some family members who lost loved ones in Afghanistan three years ago. That’s apparently true. But while those family members deserve respect and sympathy, politicians still aren’t supposed to exploit Arlington to advance their personal ambitions. For its part, Trump communications director Steven Cheung denied any wrongdoing and accused an Arlington National Cemetery official of “suffering from a mental health episode” during the incident. Cheung didn’t deny that the former president was accompanied by a photographer at Section 60, but he insisted the photographer was allowed to be there. Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita added that the cemetery official was “despicable.” I don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this story, but as it progresses, it’s hard not to wonder what the political world’s reaction might be if a Democratic candidate were caught up in a similar controversy. How many GOP officeholders would call for him or her to quit the race?"
179,"Trump claims he’s agreed to debate Harris, but there’s a catch",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 05:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-agreed-debate-kamala-harris-election-campaign-2024-rcna168568,"Following a mind-numbing process, featuring multiple reversals, Donald Trump issued an unexpected announcement by way of his social media platform: The on-again, off-again ABC News debate against Vice President Kamala Harris is back on again. “I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a Debate with Comrade Kamala Harris,” the Republican wrote in his predictably juvenile and whiny style. “It will be Broadcast Live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.” In the same online missive, the former president claimed that “the Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate” — I’ll never know why he capitalizes random words — suggesting the candidates’ microphones will be muted except when they’re answering questions, just as the Republican's team had hoped. So, all’s well that ends well? Not exactly. As is too often the case, when it comes to his own candidacy, Trump is an unreliable narrator. The New York Times reported: A Harris campaign official also confirmed with NBC News that negotiations are still underway over microphone rules. In other words, the GOP nominee told the public that the debate over the debates had been resolved, which came as something of a surprise to members of Team Harris, who knew better. For those who might benefit from a refresher, Trump initially agreed to a debate schedule three months ago, which included a Sept. 10 event on ABC News. That, of course, was when the former president assumed his opponent would be President Joe Biden. After the Democratic incumbent passed the torch to Harris, Trump abandoned his “anywhere, anyplace” chest-thumping and took a variety of clumsy steps to back out of his earlier debate commitments. In fact, three weeks ago, Team Trump made what appeared to be a categorical announcement: The GOP candidate would not participate in ABC News’ Sept. 10 presidential debate. Seven days after backing out of the debate, however, Trump reversed course and re-accepted the invitation. Around the same time, the former president held a Mar-a-Lago press conference in which he also announced the dates of other upcoming debates that hadn’t been negotiated and therefore might not occur. Two days later, on Aug. 11, Trump published a middle-of-the-night missive to his social media platform, further alerting the public to a made-up debate schedule, pointing to events that no one had agreed to. Earlier this week, the former president took all of this in an even weirder direction, signaling his newfound reluctance to participate in the Sept. 10 debate. As members of his campaign team worked behind the scenes to keep microphones muted during the event, the Republican candidate himself said he didn’t much care either way, necessarily undermining his own team in public. He added that he believed ABC News should be “shut out” of the process. Two days later, Trump agreed to the terms of the ABC News event — but he did so in a way that wasn’t altogether true. All of which is to say, the first Harris-Trump debate could be two weeks away, or it might not happen at all. The GOP nominee told the public that the underlying disputes had been resolved, but he apparently made that up, and negotiations over the relevant details are still ongoing. I’m reluctant to guess whether the event will actually happen, though one thing seems obvious: The former president was desperate to share a stage with Biden, and he appears genuinely afraid of Harris. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
180,Trump’s golf club honoring the villains of Jan. 6 is on brand — but no less disgusting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-28 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/j6-awards-gala-trump-golf-club-rcna168530,"Next week, the private golf club that former President Donald Trump owns in club in Bedminster, New Jersey, is scheduled to host a “J6 Awards Gala” to celebrate not the people who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but the people who attacked it. Trump isn’t expected to attend, according to reports, even though the Stand in the Gap Foundation, the organization that’s behind the event, boasts that it’s invited him to speak. But Trump doesn’t have to speak for us to link him to this event. It’s being held at a property he owns, and he has been very vocal in his support of the people who brutally attacked police officers in an assault on the Capitol. Last year, he spoke at a fundraiser held at the same golf course in support of the insurrectionists, and he’s hailed the attackers as “patriots” and vowed to pardon them, including those “who assaulted officers.” And even if he isn’t there Sept. 5,  the event’s website promises speaking appearances from Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and former adviser Peter Navarro, who served three months in jail for refusing to comply with the House Jan. 6 committee’s investigation. According to the event’s website, “the J6 Awards Gala … will honor and celebrate the twenty defendants who contributed to the powerful ‘Justice For All’ song” and celebrate “all J6 defendants who have shown incredible courage and sacrifice.” A presidential candidate letting his property be used to host an event where a mob attack on police officers will be celebrated as heroic is blood-boiling. As for the “Justice for All” song, which Trump has his supporters stand for at his rallies, we know the identities of many of the singers from a May 2023 Washington Post report: Texan Ryan Nichols, according to the Department of Justice, drove to the Capitol based on the “belief that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.” Nichols, who pleaded guilty to two felonies, including assaulting law enforcement officers, was wearing body armor as he “delivered two streams” of pepper spray “hitting multiple law enforcement officers.” Nichols also urged his fellow attackers to enter the Capitol with him, and yelled, “If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!” He was sentenced to five years in prison. Before he traveled from Texas to the Capitol, Shane Jenkins, another Texan, posted, “I have some sog tomahawks and tactical blades can I take those?” on social media. He was convicted at trial of eight felony charges and sentenced to seven years. Prosecutors say he pulled a “Sog” brand metal tomahawk axe out of his bag during the siege and used it to break windows. He then “riled up the crowd, telling other rioters, “Bro, we’re going in that f--- building one way or another” and “We paid for it; it’s our f--- building.” Prosecutors say he “hurled nine different objects at the officers” protecting Congress that day. Officer Brian Sicknick was one of the people pepper-sprayed by Julian Khater, another one of the singers of the “Justice for All” song. Khater pleaded guilty to “assaulting law enforcement officers with pepper spray, causing bodily injury to the officers.” Sicknick died the next day. Sarah McAbee, the organizer of this J6 awards gala, is married to Ronald Colton McAbee, a former Tennessee sheriff’s deputy who was sentenced to nearly six years in prison for assaulting police officers with “reinforced knuckle gloves.” Even more despicably, McAbee held down a police officer who’d been “knocked to the ground, kicked and stripped of his baton by other rioters,” enabling the crowd to viciously beat him. Not only are these the people Trump has promised to pardon and the people whose rendition of the national anthem he thinks deserves applause, they’re the people who’ll be celebrated and valorized at Trump National Golf Club. The Jan. 6 attack — as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves said when he testified before Congress in January — was “likely the largest single-day, mass assault of law enforcement officers in our nation’s history.” Graves made it clear that many more than the 140 officers originally reported suffered physical injuries that day — which, as he added, does not even include the scores more who suffered mental trauma. And we’ve horrifically seen several officers die of suicide in connection with what they endured on Jan 6. What Trump is doing and has done is not “treason,” at least not according to the letter of the law. But he has repeatedly provided “aid and comfort” to those who waged the first violent attack on our Capitol since the war of 1812, when the British set it on fire. Trump doesn’t belong back in the White House; he belongs in a prison cell just like the people who will be celebrated next week at the awful Jan 6 gala at his country club. "
181,Trump allies indicted in Arizona fake electors scheme get a 2026 trial date,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 13:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arizona-fake-electors-2020-election-trump-allies-rcna168466,"A judge in Arizona has set a Jan. 5, 2026, trial date for allies of Donald Trump who have been charged for their roles as fake electors in a scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. At a hearing Monday, Arizona Superior Court Judge Bruce Cohen scheduled the criminal trial to begin just one day shy of the fifth anniversary of the Capitol riots, though he called the 2026 date a “moving target.” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, in April announced the indictment of 18 Trump allies over their efforts to subvert the election results in the former president's favor. One of the defendants pleaded guilty this month, and another, lawyer Jenna Ellis, has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. The remaining 16 defendants who face criminal charges include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; Trump's former legal adviser John Eastman; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who is currently spearheading the Republican National Committee's ""election integrity"" efforts. All of them have pleaded not guilty. The Arizona case is so far the only state-level criminal prosecution related to efforts to steal the 2020 election that has set a trial date. Trump is identified as a co-conspirator in the Arizona case, but he has not been indicted. Defendants on Monday also tried to argue for dismissal of the charges by claiming that they infringed on their First Amendment rights, a defense that cites the state's anti-SLAPP law. Cohen has indicated that he is open to the defense, Politico reported. As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out, the GOP has consistently rewarded alleged fake electors in several states, elevating them to prominent positions within the party. Some have been renominated as Republican presidential electors in the November election, and others — including several Arizona defendants — were picked as delegates at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July."

183,Border-wall politics trips up Trump’s 2024 campaign (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 12:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-wall-politics-trips-trumps-2024-campaign-rcna168472,"A few months ago, Donald Trump boasted that during his term, he “built 571 miles” of border wall. The former president added that he was poised to add another 200 miles within a few weeks, concluding, “I built much more wall than I said I was going to build.” All of this was spectacularly untrue. In fact, every element of the Republican’s claims turned reality on its head, badly distorting the facts about an issue he appears to consider one of his top priorities. It was emblematic of the GOP’s broader problem with the debate over border policy: Reality keeps getting in the way of their campaign rhetoric. The Washington Post, for example, recently published an analysis of the party’s advertising, highlighting dozens of ads that criticize the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the border, “while showing chaotic scenes that were filmed in 2018 under the Trump administration.” One commercial in particular showed footage of Central American migrants in Tijuana rushing the southern border. The voice-over and text blamed Democrats for the unrest, which actually unfolded during Trump’s presidency. It was against this backdrop that the former president traveled to Arizona last week for a border-wall photo-op, though Team Trump apparently forgot to care about the details. The Post reported: There was a dramatic problem with the rhetoric: As the Post’s article explained, “This section of 20-foot steel slats was actually built during the administration of President Barack Obama.” In case this isn’t obvious, Democrats have never said border barriers are entirely unnecessary between the Pacific Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. There are high-traffic areas, party officials have long said, in which it makes sense to have structures to prevent illegal crossings. Throughout Obama’s term, it was not uncommon to build and repair barriers along these parts of the border. As of last week, Trump tried to take credit for some of the Obama administration’s work, either (a) hoping the public wouldn’t know the difference, or (b) cluelessly unaware of reality. Whatever the explanation, the Republican keeps trying to make a border wall the centerpiece of his bid for a second term, and he keeps tripping over it."
184,"Trump targets Harris, Walz with entirely made-up claims",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 11:19:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-targets-kamala-harris-tim-walz-claims-election-2024-rcna168458,"At a campaign event in Arizona late last week, Donald Trump spent a predictable amount of time targeting Vice President Kamala Harris, specifically telling his supporters, “Nobody lies like her. She is a liar. She makes up crap.” The Republican’s rhetoric was rather ironic. After all, the former president is not only the most prolific liar in recent memory, he makes stuff up on a daily basis. Indeed, minutes after insisting that the Democratic nominee “makes up crap,” Trump told the same audience that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “approved a bill to give tampons in every young man’s bathroom.” In reality, Walz did no such thing. In a speech in which the GOP candidate complained about campaign dishonesty, he peddled campaign dishonesty. Two days later, Team Trump released a campaign ad that insisted the Biden/Harris administration has “literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips.” As a Washington Post fact-check report explained, that didn’t happen. Note, this wasn’t an off-hand and unscripted comment at a rally; the Trump campaign carefully included this specific phrasing in a paid television ad. The Republican operation almost certainly knew the claim was baseless, but the former president and his 2024 team pushed it anyway. A day later, Trump spoke at the National Guard Association’s conference and took care to blame Harris for America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago, despite the fact that (a) it wasn’t Harris’ call, (b) Trump’s the one who negotiated the withdrawal agreement, and (c) his own White House national security adviser said Trump bears some responsibility for what transpired. All of which leaves the political world with an awkward question: If Harris and Walz are as awful as Republicans claim, shouldn’t Trump be able to make a compelling case against them without making stuff up? Shouldn’t it be easy for the GOP nominee and his allies to stick to reality-based critiques? Doesn't the fact that the former president has to rely so heavily on dishonesty reinforce the idea that maybe Harris and Walz aren’t so bad after all?"
185,Texas is the latest battleground in Trump's war against voters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-08-27 09:11:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-ken-paxton-lulac-doj-rcna168224,"For years, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has easily ranked among the most destructively partisan and self-servingly venal elected officials in the country. And last week, he turned his sights on suppressing the votes of Texan Latinos this fall in the name of “election integrity.” On Wednesday, Paxton’s office announced that it had carried out an undisclosed number of search warrants in several counties, including the one that houses San Antonio. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America’s oldest Latino civil rights groups, says the raids targeted several of its members. In doing so, Paxton has tipped his hand about his determination to undercut voting rights this fall — and potentially made an enemy of the very people the GOP needs to win. Republicans have twisted the phrase “election integrity” since well before President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Rather than a dedication to ensuring that every vote is counted, the GOP has coopted it as a justification for suppressing legal votes while claiming to prevent election fraud. We’ve seen efforts in other GOP-led states set up by election security offices that have brought few charges and failed to prove widespread fraud exists. Paxton’s latest stunt goes further, though, indicating a newfound focus on suppressing the work of an organization rather than disparate individuals. His office’s statement last week asserted that the searches were the result of a two-year investigation of supposed “allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting” in the 2022 election but did not specify the targets of the raids or why specific homes were raided. The GOP wound up winning all of the counties where the claim that was sent to Paxton originated, but they are also in south Texas, a region that showed mixed results overall in the midterms. The second of the two potential crimes that Paxton is investigating — “vote harvesting” — is a particularly glaring sign that there’s most likely very little substance to these allegations. In using the term, the GOP tries to evoke the incredibly rare act of someone fraudulently collecting other people’s absentee ballots and casting those votes without their awareness. But in practice, Republicans are usually referring to two entirely legal practices: establishing secure ballot drop boxes or organizations’ working to ensure that senior citizens who are unable to make it to polling places have access to mail-in ballots. The latter practice appears to be Paxton’s target, based on details reported Monday in The New York Times. Lidia Martinez, an 87-year-old living in San Antonio, who was one of the people whose homes were searched, has worked for decades helping older Latino voters register to vote. She told the Times that the officers who turned up at her house in the early morning last week were looking for voter cards that Latino residents had filled out. Finding none in their ransacking of her home, they took her laptop, her phone and other items, but not before questioning her about other LULAC members, including others whose homes had been searched. In a news conference outside Paxton’s office Monday, LULAC’s national president accused the attorney general of seeking to “harass and intimidate Latino nonprofit organizations, Latino leaders and LULAC members” with an aim to “suppress the Latino vote.” The Latino vote in Texas has become a major driving force in determining which way the seemingly deep red state swings. Most recently, growing and increasingly diverse populations in Texas’ major cities have cut into the GOP’s dominance in statewide elections, providing narrower margins of victory in those races. At the same time, Texas has underscored that Latinos as a group are nowhere near monolithic. Democrats’ share of Latino voters in South Texas counties near the border has dwindled in recent presidential elections, making their votes more highly sought-after. While that may seem to be contradictory with Trump’s racist policies and statements against immigrants from Central and South America, there’s no denying that his rhetoric about border security has resonated with voters there. That’s also increasingly the case in those same major cities that have been recently been seen as Democratic strongholds. Which leads us to Paxton’s motivations in drawing the ire of LULAC with these raids. The group had never formally backed a political candidate in its 95-year history — until this month, when it endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Paxton hasn’t exactly been a subtle operator in the past. If his office hadn’t blocked mail-in applications ahead of the 2020 election, Paxton claimed on former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s podcast in 2021, “we would’ve been one of those battleground states that they were counting votes in Harris County for three days and Donald Trump would’ve lost the election.” He also most likely feels emboldened to take bigger swings after the state Senate acquitted him of corruption charges in an impeachment trial last year. Paxton also has the comfort of knowing that he’s carrying out the will of the national GOP and its presidential nominee. Trump has instructed the Republican National Committee to devote more resources to election integrity than traditional fieldwork ahead of this election. Just last week, he insisted at a rally in North Carolina that the GOP’s “primary focus is not to get out the vote, it is to make sure [Democrats] don’t cheat.” But for the Republican plans to challenge election results in court to succeed, there needs to be a convincing case that there’s more than partisan politics at work. In targeting such a specific group and its members, Paxton may have undermined those efforts. Already, LULAC is asking the Justice Department to investigate Paxton’s efforts as a potential violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Even with years of conservatives’ narrowing the Voting Rights Act’s scope, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division can flex plenty of muscle if it believes a state has moved to suppress a minority group’s vote. Paxton may have thought that LULAC would be easy pickings or that the searches he authorized would subdue its efforts to get Latinos to the voting booth this fall. But given the response so far, I don’t think this is the fight that Paxton wanted — or one that he has much of a chance of winning."
