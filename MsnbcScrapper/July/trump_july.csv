0,Trump's NABJ appearance was the train wreck many expected,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 14:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/nabj-trump-interview-panel-chicago-rcna164300,"Just as expected, former President Donald Trump’s appearance Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention came with a bevy of bigotry and lies.  His appearance — which took the form of a panel discussion with three NABJ members moderating — had cast a pall over the convention itself before Trump even showed up, to be honest. The organization faced a deluge of denunciations from journalists and activists after it announced it would give a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the free press, spread racist propaganda and repeatedly insulted Black journalists. In fact, NABJ has issued several statements in recent years denouncing Trump’s illiberal behavior and attacks on its members. NABJ announced ahead of the panel that no one in the audience full of journalists would be permitted to ask questions. And the composition of the panel — particularly, its inclusion of Fox News host Harris Faulkner, who has given Trump chummy interviews on a network that has helped spread Trump’s lies and paid a historic legal settlement for doing so — fueled suspicion that NABJ was giving the GOP nominee a relatively friendly platform to lie and peddle propaganda.  Before the event even started, Trump claimed on Truth Social that Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, “refused” to speak at the convention as he did. In reality, as news outlets and NABJ leadership confirmed, a scheduling conflict prevented Harris from attending in person. And it was NABJ leadership who refused to allow her to hold a virtual conversation with journalists at the convention. (NABJ said Wednesday that it is ""in talks"" to hold a Q&A ""virtually or in person in September."") When it came to the event itself, what many people predicted would be a train wreck lived up to those expectations. Though NABJ leadership assured critics that Trump would be fact-checked live on social media, the PolitiFact feed tasked with doing so didn’t catch all of his lies, and the panelists didn’t catch all of them in real time, either.  Trump began his appearance with a petulant attack on a moderator, ABC senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, who asked about his history of racist rhetoric.  “I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,"" Trump responded. ""You don’t even say, 'Hello, how are you?' Are you with ABC, because I think they’re a fake news network — a terrible network. And I think it’s disgraceful."" He went on to claim he has “done so much” for Black people. Predictably, he had glowing things to say about Faulkner, whom he described as a “fantastic person.”  Then came the litany of lies. Trump lied and said Harris “happened to turn Black” a number of years ago after decades of identifying only with her Indian heritage. Harris, of course, is an HBCU-educated Black woman who has known she was Black since she was a child, but Trump’s claims align with right-wing disinformation claiming Harris isn’t truly Black — despite her father’s being a Black Jamaican. He lied — as he did during the presidential debate last month and several times since — about an “invasion” of immigrants from jails and mental institutions taking “Black jobs.” (NABJ honors journalists from outside the U.S., too. One wonders how some of them felt about that claim.) He lied about Democrats’ stance on abortion, falsely claiming the party is in favor of being able to ""execute"" babies. He lied about the criminal cases against him, claiming they exist only because he's a ""political opponent of two people that have weaponized our justice system.” He lied and claimed those convicted for their actions at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, show there are “two systems of justice.” And when he wasn’t outright lying, he was doubling down on disturbing policies. For example, he was asked about his support for immunizing police from prosecution, in response to the recent police killing of Sonya Massey. Trump said the incident ""didn't look good to me"" yet still didn’t back off of his previous calls to protect police from legal accountability for abuse.  He said during the NABJ panel: This car crash of an event was forecast by NABJ members. It sowed distrust and animus among members toward NABJ leadership. It sparked a protest outside the event, an NABJ convention co-chair’s stepping down from her role and multiple speakers’ backing out of their planned discussions.  It also highlighted some of the broader internal debates that have raged within the organization. As the Columbia Journalism Review wrote in 2018, NABJ has faced divisions over shifting paradigms in journalism, pitting some older members and other traditionalists against younger journalists “attuned to the fast pace of new media.” That rift was at play ahead of this event, with some supporters of the panel arguing NABJ's tradition of inviting presidential candidates justified inviting Trump this year and critics of the panel arguing Trump’s tendency to lie with abandon — and the fact most of his illiberal views have been broadcast for nearly a decade now — warranted a departure from the norm.  I’m with the latter group. It’s fair for NABJ leadership to have suggested there are lingering questions about what a second Trump term might look like, but the group never adequately explained why Trump — a serial liar who has targeted its members — was best suited to answer them, let alone given the opportunity to do so without better guardrails in place."
1,Trump judge in Texas border case goes too far for far-right court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 13:50:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/texas-border-rio-grande-james-ho-rcna164543,"As surprising as it sounds, the Supreme Court isn’t the most right-wing court in the country. That label better applies to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has gone too far in some cases that have led to Supreme Court smackdowns. So it doubly stands out when a 5th Circuit judge goes further than his colleagues.  That just happened in a dispute between Texas and the United States over the state’s installation of a floating barrier in the Rio Grande. By way of background, the federal government sued Texas over the move, arguing that the state had violated the law by obstructing the “navigable” capacity of the Rio Grande without congressional authorization and building the barrier without approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Ahead of a trial on the matter, the full Circuit Court sided with the state on Tuesday, reversing a trial court injunction that said the state had to move it. So the barrier remains for now. In an opinion by Donald Trump appointee Don Willett, the circuit majority decided that the trial court “clearly erred in finding that the United States will likely prove that the barrier is in a navigable stretch of the Rio Grande.”  Though the circuit sided with Texas, Willett’s ruling didn’t need to address the state’s far-reaching claim that it is permitted to erect the barrier in defense of a border “invasion.” The Constitution says that “No State shall, without the Consent of Congress . . .  engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.” And here’s where we get to the circuit judge who went further than his colleagues: James Ho, also a Trump appointee. The former Clarence Thomas clerk deemed it necessary to address the invasion question and he agreed with Texas, writing that the case “presents a strategic military decision directed toward a foreign enemy within the State’s authority” and that because the state’s claim presents a “political question” that courts can’t review, the case should be dismissed.   Ho’s opinion has been criticized from the right and the left. One of his Trump-appointed colleagues, Judge Andrew Oldham (who clerked for Justice Samuel Alito), wrote separately to explain why the court didn’t need to reach the invasion issue. Oldham noted that it’s “well settled that we should not reach constitutional questions if we can instead decide the case on a non-constitutional ground.” A dissenting opinion from Biden-appointed Judge Dana Douglas further pointed out that Texas’ position “would enable Governor Abbott to engage in acts of war in perpetuity.”  Ho is known for taking outlandish positions, so his opinion isn’t entirely surprising, however extreme its implications. But it’s worth considering because he has been floated as a possible Supreme Court nominee should Trump return to office in November — a scenario that could make the high court more like the 5th Circuit.

2,Kamala Harris practically dares Trump to debate her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 12:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-debate-september-rcna164521,"Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, once again challenged Donald Trump to debate her, telling a roaring crowd in Atlanta on Tuesday night that he was feeling the pressure of running against her in November. ""So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it — you may have noticed,"" the vice president said at a campaign rally, as she pointed to Trump's refusal to commit to a debate in September. “He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.” “Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” Harris said. “Because as the saying goes, 'if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.'” Harris' remarks seem designed to taunt Trump into debating her. The vice president has been engaged in a back-and-forth with the Trump campaign as it dithers the GOP nominee's participation in a previously agreed-upon Sept. 10 debate, which it arranged with Joe Biden's re-election campaign before he withdrew from the race. On Thursday, Harris accused the Trump campaign of “backpedaling” on the scheduled debate, saying, “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.” Trump's campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, later said it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.” The calculations for the Trump campaign have shifted dramatically since Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. Trump had previously challenged Biden to debate “anytime, anywhere, any place,” and the fallout of Biden’s disastrous showing at the June 27 debate also overshadowed his own blathering performance. Now, as his campaign tries to reorient its strategy for Harris, Trump, whose debate style is rich on insults and poor on substance, now faces the daunting prospect of taking on a former prosecutor known for her debate punches on live television. In an interview with Fox News this week, Trump himself waffled on the subject. He suggested there was no point debating Harris because “everybody knows who I am, and now people know who she is.” He then said he would “probably” debate Harris, but added that he “can also make a case for not doing it.”"
3,Why it matters that Mark Kelly is slamming Trump for killing a border deal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 09:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mark-kelly-slamming-trump-killing-border-deal-election-2024-republican-rcna164519,"The current Congress has been dreadful for a great many reasons, but arguably the lowest of the low points was the fight over a bipartisan agreement on border policies. Months later, it’s something Democrats are eager to discuss anew. In case anyone needs a refresher, it was last fall when congressional Republicans said they were so desperate to deal with U.S./Mexico border policies that they took a radical step: GOP officials said that unless Democrats agreed to a series of conservative reforms, Republicans were prepared to cut off military aid to Ukraine and let Russia take part of Eastern Europe by force. Democrats, left with little choice, agreed to pay the GOP’s ransom and endorsed a conservative, bipartisan compromise. At that point, Republicans killed the compromise plan they’d demanded — largely because Donald Trump told them to. Making matters worse, the calculus was electoral, not substantive: The former president didn’t want Congress to hand President Joe Biden an election-year victory on one of the party’s top priorities. Republicans followed Trump’s lead and concluded that they’d rather have a campaign issue than a solution. As NBC News reported, some leading Democrats believe it’s time to refresh voters’ memories about what happened and why. “This was not meeting the Republicans on the 50-yard line, this was meeting them on the 10-yard line,” the Arizona Democrat said during an appearance on MSNBC. “On their side of the field, we realized, we’ve got to get operational control over the border. I realized this, Kamala Harris realizes this, and this legislation was going to do that,” he added. “And our goal here was to get this legislation passed and then start working on comprehensive immigration reform. But this was stopped dead in its tracks by Donald Trump because he wanted to have this as an election issue. Like a lot of other Republicans, they don’t actually want to solve this problem.” To be sure, it’s not a secret that Kelly is being considered for his party’s vice presidential nomination, and his comments Wednesday morning served as a timely reminder about his focus on a key issue in the national campaign. But whether Kelly makes Harris’ 2024 ticket or not, the point he emphasized this morning deserves to be at the center of the public conversation: Every time Trump and Republicans refer to conditions at the border, they should be reminded of the fact that they, at the former president’s behest, rejected a conservative border reform package — twice — that they co-authored and requested. What’s more, it’s not just Democrats who’ve accused the GOP of killing the bill at Trump’s insistence. The Harris campaign just released a new video via social media highlighting a variety of instances in which Republicans have conceded that the Democratic claim is true. The video didn’t include Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but the Kentucky Republican said largely the same thing in April. Kelly helped put all of this in the spotlight Wednesday morning, and no one should be surprised when other Democrats do the same thing every time Trump brings up the border between now and Election Day 2024."
4,"Trump pushes his luck with new attack on Harris, China and Russia",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 07:49:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pushes-luck-new-attack-harris-china-russia-election-2024-rcna164482,"In her first week as an unexpected presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris confronted plenty of racist and sexist lines of attack, but as a Washington Post report makes clear, Donald Trump added to this record in an especially ugly way in his latest Fox News interview. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham started to ask the GOP candidate how international leaders would consider a Harris presidency, but before she could even finish asking, Trump interjected. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy. They look at her and they say, ‘We can’t believe we got so lucky.’” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Post the Republican nominee wasn’t referring to race or gender, and if you believe that, I have a lovely Trump University seminar I’d love to sell you. The obvious problem with the former president’s comments was that they were overtly offensive in ways even he should be able to understand. But there are plenty of less obvious problems, too. For one thing, Harris has spent the last four years in national office, meeting with international officials and leaving no doubt that she’s a force to be reckoned with. For another, if Trump is so convinced that international leaders will walk all over the Democrat, perhaps he could explain why he’s so afraid to share a debate stage with her. But perhaps most important is the degree to which Trump keeps failing tests of self-awareness. Indeed, if he’s looking for an American leader who wasn’t taken seriously abroad, Trump probably ought to find a mirror. In 2018, for example, he addressed the United Nations general assembly, where foreign diplomats literally laughed at him. China’s state-run media routinely characterized Trump — during his presidency — as a bumbling fool who had a habit of slapping himself in the face. Even U.S. allies quietly conceded that they perceived the then-president as an intemperate child with a short attention span. Let's also not forget about a 2019 international gathering in which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the U.K.'s Boris Johnson were overheard mocking Trump, treating him like a punch-line to a joke they found rather exasperating. Russia’s Vladimir Putin was more reluctant to ridicule Trump in public, but that’s only because he enjoyed walking all over the Republican and didn’t feel the need to put that advantage at risk. All of which is to say, Trump’s latest line of attack isn’t just ugly, and it isn’t just wrong. It’s also the latest example of the former president engaging in projection."
5,"The problem(s) with Trump’s ugly rhetoric about Harris, antisemitism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-ugly-rhetoric-harris-antisemitism-jewish-election-2024-rcna164448,"Donald Trump seems determined to convince voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is antisemitic. She’s not, and the former president’s attacks are as ugly as they are false, but the Republican appears preoccupied with pushing this line anyway. During a speech last week, for example, the GOP nominee falsely said his likely Democratic rival is “totally against the Jewish people” — a curious claim about someone who’s married to a Jewish person — and as the Associated Press reported, Trump went even further yesterday. The former president seemed quite worked up on the issue, ranting that Harris dislikes both Israel and Jews — it’s something “everybody knows,” Trump said, reality notwithstanding — while adding that Jewish voters are “fools” to vote Democratic. The radio host, Sid Rosenberg, proceeded to say that Harris’ Jewish husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is “a crappy Jew” and “a horrible Jew.” And while Trump didn’t use those words himself, as an audio clip makes clear, he seemed to agree with the condemnations. A Politico report described the comments as ""bizarre."" A press statement from the Harris campaign, not surprisingly, went much further, describing the on-air exchange as “disgusting” and adding, “America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump.” At this point, we could spend a few paragraphs talking about how wrong the Republican’s attack is. We could also highlight the fact that Trump hasn’t even tried to substantiate his absurdities with evidence. But as important as those points are, I’m struck by a larger point: Trump apparently believes he has credibility when it comes to antisemitism, but he really doesn’t. As regular readers might recall, it was just four months ago, for example, when the GOP nominee invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel. To put it mildly, Jewish Democrats in Congress were not impressed. An Axios report quoted Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, for example, saying, “Trump demonstrates daily his lack of fitness for the presidency by spreading dangerous stereotypes and embracing antisemites.” Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina added that the former president’s rhetoric is “particularly disgraceful and dangerous at a time when Jews are facing dangerous levels of antisemitism nationwide.” Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland issued an especially pointed response, noting, “Luckily I don’t know any Jews who look to Donald Trump for advice on how to be Jewish. After all, this is the guy who saw ‘very fine people on both sides’ of an antisemitic riot and entertained the neo-Nazi Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes over at his house at Mar-a-Lago for dinner.” That larger pattern was of particular interest. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, “You’re not gonna support me because I don’t want your money. You want to control your politicians.” He added, “I’m a negotiator — like you folks.” Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met “in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.” While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their “loyalties.” Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council’s national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign. There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters “don’t love Israel enough,” dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago and arguing that Jews need to “get their act together” and “appreciate” Israel “before it is too late.” In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders “should be ashamed of themselves” over their “lack of loyalty.” Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker. In his earlier campaigns, Trump has struggled badly with Jewish voters. If he thinks lying about Harris will change that, the Republican probably ought to lower his expectations. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
6,Why Trump targeted Christians with his darkest promise yet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/christian-nationalist-trump-speech-voting-rcna164091,"In a speech at the Turning Point USA Believers’ Summit on Friday, Donald Trump implored audience members to vote in the 2024 election, assuring them that, if he gets a second term, “it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” In four years, he reiterated, “you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham recognized the anti-democratic promise that his supporters “won’t have to vote anymore” had created problems for Trump. In an interview with the former president on Monday, she encouraged him to clarify his statement, yet he continued to repeat it multiple times. Taken together with the rest of Trump’s speech, in which he cast himself as a divinely protected savior of his supporters’ vision for America, and falsely portrayed Kamala Harris as a ruthless persecutor of patriotic believers, his doubling down on his promise to “fix” it sends an unambiguous message. It is the most definitive statement to date of his intention to implement the Christian nationalist autocracy sought by his most ardent believers. Trump made false claims that the Biden-Harris administration “weaponized” the government against Christians, and picked up on an attack circulating in right-wing media that Kamala Harris is anti-Catholic. That smear dates back to Harris’ time as senator and her 2018 questioning of Trump judicial nominee Brian Buescher. Harris had questioned whether Buescher’s membership in the Knights of Columbus, a fraternal Catholic organization that vociferously opposes reproductive and LGBTQ rights, would impede his impartiality as a judge. At the time, the pro-choice group Catholics for Choice defended Harris, arguing that the Knights of Columbus was no apolitical charity as conservatives claimed, but “brazenly used” its status “to pour money, effort and influence into political contests and policy debates.” When Harris ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primary, conservatives resurrected the questioning to charge that she had engaged in anti-Catholic bigotry. Since Harris announced her bid for the presidency last week, right-wing media has resuscitated this attack, even though Harris has served under Joe Biden, a committed Catholic. “She is without question one of the most aggressively anti-Catholic career politicians in American history,” wrote an editor for the conservative nonprofit CatholicVote. A staff writer for the Federalist claimed that “she has a long history of anti-Catholic bigotry that not only hurts pro-lifers but also faithful papists.” In his speech, Trump claimed Harris had “viciously attacked” judicial nominees because they were Catholic, and claimed she is “really militantly hostile toward Americans of faith.” He also claimed that Harris “wants to forcibly compel doctors and nurses against their will to give chemical castration, drugs to young children” and wants to force “every public school in America to let men into women’s and girls’ locker rooms.” In short, “the Harris agenda is an agenda for national destruction,” he said. “The Trump agenda is an agenda for national renewal and greatness.” These comments are particularly incendiary to an audience steeped in rhetoric that the Christian America that God intended is under siege from secular leftists. The Believers’ Summit was billed as “a testament to our commitment to see the body of Christ rise to its calling in this pivotal moment in history. We are dedicated to seeing believers not just defend their faith, but to put it into action, ultimately turning our nation towards the Lord.” Speakers included Christian nationalist author and revisionist historian David Barton, Christian right author and podcast host Eric Metaxas (also a prominent promoter of Trump’s stolen election lie) and Doug Wilson, the extremist pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Wilson explicitly promotes theocracy, or what he has called “a network of nations bound together by a formal acknowledgement of the lordship of Jesus Christ,” rejecting civil government as “demonic” and “satanic.” In the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump earlier this month, TPUSA’s founder, Charlie Kirk, promoted the claim — echoed in rightwing media and at the Republican National Convention — that Trump had been spared because he wore the “armor of God.” Kirk had picked up on a tweet from Jack Posobiec, who has called for the overthrow of democracy and declared anyone on the left “un-human,” claiming that God had protected Trump as an anointed figure in a cosmic battle between good and evil. On Friday, Trump thanked supporters for their prayers: “I stand before you tonight thanks to the power of prayer and the grace of almighty God.” To assure the audience that he would defend them from supposed persecution of Christians by the left, Trump reprised his promise to create “a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias and its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America.” This is another way of telling his followers that they will be able to impose their ideology — against abortion, against LGBTQ freedom, against anything they consider part of the “woke” or “globalist” agenda — on the grounds that freedom for others, whether in the bedroom, examination room or classroom, is “anti-Christian.” The question of just how literally to take Trump’s assurance that Christians “won’t have to vote anymore” is almost besides the point. Long before 2028, Trump is promising his supporters in the religious right that he will bring about the Christian nationalist government that they seek. And democracy is not a priority for those who would be “turning our nation to the Lord.” The triumphant rollout of Harris’s presidential campaign has left Trump and his allies running scared. But he’s also playing a dangerous game with a base that has been hearing a great deal of very hot rhetoric about godly versus demonic forces, and about their political adversaries being “un-human.” Trump is trying to capitalize on all this hate, casting it as a religious war, and hoping to ride it to authoritarian rule."
7,The ghost of Antonin Scalia might like a word with Trump on flag-burning,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 14:29:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-antonin-scalia-stupid-rcna163688,"Donald Trump told Fox News that “stupid people” would argue that punishing people for desecrating the American flag is unconstitutional. One notable figure who’d fail Trump’s constitutional test is Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice revered by conservatives whose seat Trump filled with his first high-court appointee, Neil Gorsuch. The subject came up in the context of people burning flags at protests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. Trump said on “Fox & Friends”: “I think you should get a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American flag. Now, people will say, ‘Oh, it’s unconstitutional.’ Those are stupid people.” (Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s poised to run against Trump in November’s presidential election, issued a statement condemning flag-burning, Hamas and antisemitism but didn’t call for jailing flag burners.) The Supreme Court addressed the issue in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. Liberal Justice William Brennan wrote the 5-4 majority opinion, joined by Scalia, that said: “After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest, Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in violation of Texas law. This case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent with the First Amendment. We hold that it is not.” And while Scalia would have disagreed with Trump’s legal judgment, the justice was a proto-Trumpian type who likely would have agreed with the former president’s instinct. Indeed, Scalia later said in public remarks that “If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag. But I am not king.” That was before the Supreme Court’s recent immunity ruling for Trump that did make presidents more like kings. But that doesn’t change the constitutionality of flag-burning — at least until the Supreme Court says so.

8,Biden's remarks showed he's a man of character. The same can't be said for Trump.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 14:24:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-speech-oval-office-address-nation-rcna163623,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 25 episode of ""Morning Joe."" ""Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from the modest beginnings of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States. But here I am."" Those were the words of Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday — the president of the United States.  There was no bitterness, no resentment, no self-pity in his voice, or in his presentation. His family sat to the left of the Resolute Desk, his wife and his children, as he gave that address – as he walked into history. History these days doesn’t move like a clock, it moves like a stopwatch, it’s so fast. The speed of history is frightening sometimes, and he is now part of history. Always will be.  He spoke with his family right there but part of it seemed to me that he was speaking to the American family, as well. During the speech, he asked the question: ""Does character in public life still matter?” Well, I would submit that it does. And I would submit that on Wednesday, you saw a portrait of character in the president of the United States.  Going forward, I think his place in history is well-sealed by his presidency, by the accomplishments of his presidency, and by his withdrawal from the presidency. You can only imagine how difficult it is for anyone to give up such power. We can’t really imagine it because we’ve never held power in our hands the way the president of the United States does.  We’ve seen what happens when a president misuses power. We’ve seen what happens when a sitting president refuses to cede power. And now, America has been given an object lesson in character and history by a man proclaiming: Here I am, Joe Biden, behind the Resolute Desk, ceding power."
9,A political violence scholar explains what's at stake after the Trump shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 13:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-shooter-rcna162412,"Pennsylvania man Thomas Crooks’ attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump on July 13 rattled the nation. The attempt on Trump’s life, and the shocking spectacle it generated, has raised fears about the increasing hostility in our political atmosphere, with violent rhetoric seeping into the mainstream. There are also questions of whether the act could inspire future copycats or aggressive counterprotests. In this particular instance, some of the long-term fallout of the shooting may hinge on the motive of the shooter, which investigators and authorities are still having enormous trouble identifying. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress on Wednesday that the bureau’s investigation has not “yielded significant clues.” Another factor in whether this fades or sticks as a momentous event is how different political movements and parties react to it. While President Joe Biden and Democrats uniformly condemned violence as unacceptable, a number of Republicans attributed Crooks’ act to Democratic rhetoric, despite not knowing what motivated Crooks and the fact that Democrats have not called for political violence. What remains to be seen is how people interpret it in the long term. To get a better understanding of what happened and how to think about it, I called up Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, whom I've interviewed before about America's growing problem with political violence. We discussed the possible motives behind the shooter’s actions, what makes political violence lead toward more large-scale conflict — like civil war — and how we as a society can turn the temperature down to prevent a spiral into chaos. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Zeeshan Aleem: It seems that investigators and reporters have had trouble so far identifying the ideology of the shooter. How should we think about how to interpret the event? Lilliana Mason: We don’t know what this guy was thinking. He could’ve been a school shooter type that’s sad and looking for attention. But it was political violence to the extent that it was violence at a political event targeting the leader of one of our two political parties. And so whether or not he meant it to be political violence, it’s going to be taken by people as political. One thing that I worried about immediately was whether it would be taken up — as JD Vance did — as “they did this to us.” I have a lot of research with my co-author Nathan Kalmoe showing that if you ask partisans — people who identify with one party or usually vote for it — whether political violence is OK, 10% to 20% say that it could be. But then if you ask them, “What if the other party is violent first, then would it be OK to use violence?” And then the numbers really skyrocket. In earlier data that we had from 2020, we saw them go up to around 40% of people saying it would be OK if the other side did it first. I was looking at data from June that we just got in, and actually on that one it was even more disturbing: It went up to basically 60% of people saying, “If they started it, then political violence would be OK.”  Could you expand on what a school shooter type means and how that might be significant? Mason: A “school shooter” can do violence anywhere. It’s horrible that we even have a word for this, right? It’s only in America that we have this word. This guy was very young. He was not even old enough to drink, and in the last election he was 16; this would have been his first election voting for president. It sounds like he was relatively isolated and troubled, and his politics were confusing. He was a registered Republican. [He also donated $15 to a Democratic organization via Act Blue.] We just don’t know. If there was an ideological reason, then it really fits firmly in the category of political violence that he wanted Trump to die because Trump was dangerous or because he didn’t like his platform. But if it’s more on the school shooter end of the spectrum, he may have targeted Trump because, for example, he wanted be famous, and was maybe already suicidal and this was his chosen way to go. The Reagan shooter was not ideological. It wasn’t because he hated Reagan necessarily. It was because he wanted Jodie Foster to pay attention to him. Some right-wingers claim that Trump’s shooting was an outcome of describing Trump as an existential threat to democracy. What’s your response? Mason: It’s possible that framing this as an existential election encourages violence in the sense that violence tends to emerge when we don’t believe that we have remedies within the system, right? That’s when we do protests; we engage in an anti-system way. But if we believe that we have remedies within the system, like voting, then we don’t need to engage in violence.  But what that ignores is that the Republican Party also thinks this is an existential election and that, if Biden wins, we will descend into socialism and communism and whatever else they think. It’s not being framed as an existential election just from the Democratic side. And the other thing is that Trump being the victim of this really overshadows the extent to which Trump himself has encouraged violence since the beginning of his 2016 campaign. He encourages it at his rallies — when people are violent on his behalf, he doesn’t condemn it. He didn’t ask the Jan. 6 people to stop until hours after they had already done all the damage they could do. He made fun of the violent attack on [former House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi’s husband. What does history and social science tell us about the possible repercussions of a presidential assassination attempt? In the 1960s there were a lot of assassinations and also assassination attempts. I think the 60s is a really good analogy to today in the sense of social upheaval, a lot of social progress, previously marginalized groups claiming their power back, and that was very disruptive for the traditional social hierarchy. The difference between the 60s and today is that the political parties didn’t take sides on that divide in the 60s. There were both more progressive and more conservative people in both the Democratic and the Republican parties, and so it didn’t pit the parties against each other on this really volatile topic. Now that we have Republicans as the party of “Let’s go back to the traditional hierarchy” and the Democrats as the party of “We still need to make more progress toward equality,” we’re going into the voting booth thinking about this. That means that the elections themselves and transitions of power feel more existential because they’re related to who belongs in America. It’s related to questions of like “which racial group is best” and “which religion is best” —  these are not things we’re supposed to bring into the voting booth. We’re supposed to find the people that represent our families, and bring us material well-being, and that our pocketbook likes, but instead, our politics are now arranged around who gets to live with the full dignity of being an American. We know that there’s political science that’s shown that in other countries, when politics is divided along racial or ethnic or religious lines, the chance of civil war increases 12 times, because those types of divides are uncompromisable. What’s the best way to turn down the temperature right now in terms of preventing escalatory spirals and worst-case scenarios? Mason: It requires all of the leaders on both sides to reject violence. One thing that my co-author Nathan and I found for our book was that it’s pretty easy to get people to back off of approving of political violence. You just have them read a quote from either Trump or Biden saying that’s not acceptable, that “we don’t do that in a democracy, and if you are going to engage in violence, I don’t want you on my team.” Reading two sentences from a leader in our survey experiment made people back off. It’s really important to note that leaders have a really powerful role to play. And we’ve heard that from Biden and from some Republicans, but we haven’t heard it from Trump or Vance. And so the problem is the people who need to be turning down the temperature are unwilling to turn down the temperature. They have the power to, but they’re not using it. I have seen some people sort of worrying about the possibility of mass violence or civil war. As a researcher on violence, how do you strike the balance between telling people to be concerned about things, but also not catastrophizing, since political violence is a reality across human history and doesn’t necessarily always slide into something like civil war?  Thank you for asking that. I think it’s really important to pay attention to political violence, but it’s also important to remember that it is still exceedingly rare. We have a lot of threats, but not as many actions. And the number of acts of political violence are very, very few. As long as that’s the case, it’s really important for Americans to do their part as citizens and not turn their back on democracy because they’re afraid. This shouldn’t be meant to scare people out of voting or going to their voting places, or even volunteering at their polling places, right? The people that run our elections are mainly volunteers. They are dedicated to democracy. They’re absolutely heroic and brave and they are committed. If people get afraid that everything is violent, then they might withdraw from participating and having their voices heard. And we don’t want that to happen. "
10,The one Democratic criticism that seems to bother Trump the most,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 11:37:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-democratic-criticism-seems-bother-trump-rcna163685,"In the aftermath of the assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, many leading Republicans not only blamed Democrats, but GOP officials also pointed specifically to one Democratic talking point: Describing the former president as a threat to democracy, Republicans said, was simply beyond the pale. The GOP nominee is apparently thinking along the same lines. Politico reported: It might seem like a simple, albeit cheap, line at a campaign rally, but the closer one looks at the rhetoric, the more important it becomes. Right off the bat, Trump’s interest in “unity” has obviously been thrown out the window. Earlier this week, the former president said he was shot because “the Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me,” and as of Wednesday night, he tried to draw a direct connect between a Democratic talking point and the attempt on his life. It’s wildly irresponsible to talk this way — investigators still say they don’t know what motivated the shooter — but Trump clearly doesn’t care. What’s more, it’s tough to take the former president’s complaints about the rhetoric seriously, given his own record. In fact, the week before the shooting in Pennsylvania, Trump described the Biden administration as a “fascist government,” as his campaign operation issued a fundraising appeal asserting as fact that President Joe Biden is “a threat to democracy.” Two weeks earlier, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND EXISTENCE OF OUR COUNTRY ITSELF!!!” The hysterical missive dovetailed with months of rhetoric in which Trump has told voters that the United States would likely cease to exist if he loses. If he thinks it’s dangerous for Democrats to push such criticism, perhaps Trump can explain why he has pushed the same criticism. Complicating matters, the Republican candidate might not like the Democratic line, but it’s rooted in fact. As we’ve discussed, this is a White House hopeful who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. If Trump doesn’t want to be accused of threatening democracy, then he might want to try curtailing his threats to democracy. Finally, it’s hard not to wonder what Republicans’ internal polling has to say on this. The scope of the pushback against this specific talking point suggests it might be potent."
11,Melania Trump will tell her story in an upcoming memoir this fall,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 11:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-memoir-rcna163651,"Melania Trump, the inscrutable former first lady who has largely avoided the public eye after her husband's time in office, will tell her own story in a memoir set to be released in the fall. Titled “Melania,” the book will chart “a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence,” her office said in a statement Thursday. The book is currently available for preorder on her website for $40. Signed copies go for $75. A full-color collector’s edition with ""bonus photographs"" is priced at $150 and will come with an optional digital collectible. Trump’s office did not announce a release date. “Melania” is published by Skyhorse Publishing, which has released books from other MAGA world figures, including former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec. Melania Trump promoted her memoir on social media on Thursday, writing, ""May your experience reading my book be as enjoyable as the writing process was for me."" It will be the first memoir from the former first lady, who is intensely private. Her time as first lady was marked by a contentious relationship with the press and a discomfort with the confines of the role. She quickly receded from public life after leaving the White House in January 2021, and she has rarely been seen in public since. Her absence on the campaign trail as her husband vies for another term in office has sparked some speculation, and she forwent a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention earlier this month, bucking longstanding tradition. Coincidentally, Donald Trump also announced on Thursday that he is releasing a photo book — his third since leaving office — titled ""Save America,"" on Sept. 3. The book will feature ""iconic moments"" from his first term and lay out his vision for a second term, according to its publisher, Winning Team Publishing. The book is available for pre-order at $99, though signed copies are priced at an eye-popping $499."
12,"Eager for attention, Trump returns to a favorite topic: his legal cases",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 09:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-legal-cases-harris-rcna163607,"Up until Sunday afternoon, Donald Trump was about as buoyant as we’ve seen him over the last several years. After the Supreme Court and Florida federal judge Aileen Cannon handed him significant legal wins in rapid succession, he also survived an assassination attempt so brazen (and preventable) that scores of allies declared Trump had been touched by the divine — and then went on to bask in the adulation of the MAGA-faithful at the Republican National Convention last week.  But the more relaxed, subdued Trump disappeared almost as quickly as he came, as NBC News’s Vaughn Hillyard observed after watching Trump’s first, post-convention rally. And judging by his social media posts, one topic that has him especially exercised? His legal proceedings, three of which he mischaracterized in a series of Truth Social posts on Wednesday. First, Trump touted his “big win” in a “high Florida court” against ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos, which Trump claimed is a “powerful case” that will force the news media “to start telling the truth.” But Trump’s description of that development is misleading at best.  The ruling Trump was referencing came down Wednesday from a federal trial court — or, in other words, the lowest level of the federal court system — and merely determined that Trump’s defamation case against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, which stemmed from the latter’s March interview with GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, cannot be dismissed now, at the outset of the litigation. In his lawsuit, Trump claims that Stephanopoulos’ repeated statement that a judge and two juries held Trump liable for raping author E. Jean Carroll was both false and malicious. But in its effort to have the case thrown out, ABC argued that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over Carroll’s two trials, had already determined, in a written opinion, that the first jury “implicitly” found that Trump had “‘raped’ [Carroll], albeit digitally rather than with his penis,” and therefore, that Trump could not dispute that conclusion. In a July 2023 ruling, Kaplan determined that “[t]he finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’ Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.” ABC also argued that even if Kaplan had never made that ruling, his underlying reasoning was sound and should apply because Stephanopoulos’ descriptions of the jury’s verdict were “substantially true”— and therefore could not constitute defamation. (In delivering their verdict, the jury in the first Carroll case did not find Trump liable for rape, as that term is defined under New York law, and instead held him liable for sexual abuse.) Trump is right that Judge Cecilia Altonaga rejected both of those arguments, allowing the case to continue. But she also made plain that Trump’s purported “big win” was hardly the final word, explaining that she was “not reaching the merits of [Trump’s] claims. [ABC and Stephanopoulos] may very well convince a reasonable factfinder” — meaning a jury — “to follow Judge Kaplan’s reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos’s statements were not defamatory.” That, however, “is not the issue before the Court now,” Altonaga clarified. Within hours, Trump was crowing about yet another legal victory, albeit just as inaccurately. “I got out of my Documents case,” he posted, invoking the recently dismissed Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, “by WINNING against the FULL FORCE AND POWER of the U.S. Department of Justice.” Yet Cannon’s dismissal of that case rested solely on her determination that special counsel Jack Smith, who has not been subject to day-to-day supervision by the Justice Department, was appointed and funded in violation of certain provisions of the Constitution. Put another way, as MSNBC Legal Analyst Andrew Weissmann has noted, she dismissed the case because Smith — who was not confirmed by the Senate, as is required for “principal officers” of the executive branch — was functioning too independently of the attorney general and the DOJ. She didn't dismiss the case because Smith was backed by “the FULL FORCE AND POWER” of the DOJ, as Trump claimed, much less acting in concert with the department's leadership. But Trump’s third distortion of a judicial decision was Wednesday’s charm. For the first time, Trump — who complained constantly about the gag order in his New York criminal case during that trial — asserted that the order is now “interfering” with his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris and was engineered by Manhattan criminal court judge Juan Merchan “to benefit my Democrat Opponent.” (Harris, of course, wasn't yet running for president during the trial in April and May.) Trump failed to mention, however, that the gag order has never encompassed any statements about President Joe Biden, Harris or anyone in their administration. Instead, by its plain terms, it was entered to protect discrete and small groups of people key to the trial: known and foreseeable trial witnesses, jurors, lawyers and court personnel directly involved in the case, their family members, and finally, after a raft of threats, the families of both the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (but not the judge or Bragg themselves). Moreover, since late June, Trump has been relieved from the gag order’s provisions about trial jurors, whose names and addresses still may not be revealed, and witnesses, who can be discussed in any and all respects. It’s hard to see, therefore, how what remains of the gag order — namely, prohibitions on statements about the lawyers, courthouse staff, their families, and the families of the judge and DA — could impede Trump’s presidential campaign, much less constrain any core political speech. These distinctions, important as they are, will be lost on those who hang on Trump’s every word on Truth Social. But where it comes to legal proceedings, Trump has never played nice — and even a brush with death is unlikely to change that."
13,Why Trump wants his handpicked FBI director to ‘resign immediately’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 08:16:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-wants-fbi-director-resign-immediately-chris-wray-rcna163641,"Seven years ago next week, Christopher Wray, Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was sworn into office. After the 2020 elections, President Joe Biden had an opportunity to replace Wray with his own FBI director, but the Democrat said he was comfortable leaving Wray in place. But while FBI directors generally serve 10-year terms, Wray probably realizes by now that his future will be decided by the 2024 presidential race. The FBI chief testified yesterday before the House Judiciary Committee and offered new insights into the investigation of the recent assassination attempt targeting Trump. But as part of the hearing, Republicans pressed Wray on whether he’d seen a decline in Biden’s health. He said he had not. As NBC News reported, the comments were not well received by the former president who appointed him. In an online statement published to his social media platform, the Republican candidate specifically called on Wray to “resign immediately,” adding, “Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!” There is literally no evidence of Wray lying to Congress. But I’m also curious about whether the testimony related to Biden was the only thing that troubled the former president. During the same hearing, for example, Wray said there’s some uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Trump’s injury from the shooting in Pennsylvania. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” Wray told lawmakers, adding, “There’s a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.” This, coupled with the fact that the former president and his team have been reluctant to share even basic details about his medical care after the shooting, is generating new questions on Capitol Hill. For example, Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York — a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor — wrote online this morning, “We must see Donald Trump’s official medical records.” We probably haven’t heard the last of this."
14,It just got harder for Trump to distance himself from Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 07:40:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/just-got-harder-trump-distance-project-2025-election-2024-vance-rcna163631,"For months, Democrats have tried to let the public know about Project 2025, a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by the Heritage Foundation with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. Earlier this month, however, Democrats received some unexpected help — from the former president himself. A few weeks ago, the Republican nominee published an odd item to his social media platform claiming to “know nothing” about Project 2025. He went on to claim he has “no idea who is behind it,” he disagrees with some of its provisions, and he has “nothing to do with” the initiative. Democrats were delighted: Trump’s denial helped bring attention to the Project 2025 plan, which is exactly what the party was hoping for. The former president nevertheless issued a similar statement a week later, which again helped to push the radical blueprint into the national spotlight. At a rally in Michigan this past weekend, the GOP candidate not only tried to distance himself from Project 2025, he also described its authors as part of the “severe right,” adding that some of the agenda’s provisions are “seriously extreme.” Trump reiterated his position online again yesterday. All of this has the effect of alerting the public to the right-wing agenda’s existence — which again is what Democrats are hoping for — while simultaneously reminding voters that the Project 2025 is so extreme that even Trump doesn’t want to be associated with it. But there’s a related problem: The more Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025, the more we’re confronted with evidence pointing in the opposite direction. A Media Matters report explained: Well, that certainly won’t help. Complicating matters, a recent CNN report explained that “at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025 ... including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to ‘Mandate for Leadership,’ the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch.” What’s more, NBC News tracked down a 2022 speech in which Trump spoke at a Heritage Foundation event and said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” In case that weren’t quite enough, Media Matters also discovered that Paul Dans, a former Trump administration official and the director of Project 2025, told a right-wing podcast last year that his group has a “great” relationship with the former president and that “Trump’s very bought in with this.” I can appreciate why Trump doesn’t want to be associated with Project 2025 — most voters would find the agenda to be almost cartoonishly extreme — but his denials keep running up against reality. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
15,"Trump says Harris shouldn’t be ‘allowed to run,’ recycling weird claim",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-harris-shouldnt-allowed-run-recycling-weird-claim-rcna163593,"In his first rally since President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race, Donald Trump did exactly what everyone expected him to do: The Republican spent much of the event going after Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president’s case against his new rival, however, has tended to rely heavily on vague name-calling: Trump called the likely Democratic nominee a “lunatic,” for example. But during his pitch in North Carolina, one the GOP nominee’s lines of attack stood out: The Republican’s followers, naturally, cheered the rhetoric. There is a degree of irony to the comments: A jury recently found Trump guilty of nearly three dozen felonies. If Harris “shouldn’t even be allowed to run for president” because “she’s committing crimes,” then I supposed we should look forward to the former president delivering a withdrawal speech of his own. What’s more, insisting that the Democratic vice president is “committing crimes” would be less ridiculous if Trump had any evidence of Harris, you know, actually committing crimes. But of particular interest was the GOP candidate’s suggestion that his likely Democratic rival “shouldn’t even be allowed to run” for the White House. If the comment rang a bell, there’s a good reason for that: Part of the problem here is that the Republican nominee is getting lazy, recycling stale insults, nicknames and attacks. But just as notable is the fact that Trump has long taken a keen interest in who should and shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him, and in a remarkable coincidence, he consistently argues that those who stand in his way are — or should be — ineligible for American ballots. Trump already earned a reputation as someone who was hostile toward democracy. This won’t help. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
16,Trump voters fear 'excitement' of Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/wisconsin-voters-swing-state-trump-harris-2024-rcna163528,"On Tuesday, Elise Jordan, an MSNBC political analyst and former George W. Bush administration staffer, sat down with voters in the battleground state of Wisconsin. The Badger State has played a pivotal role in deciding the last two presidential elections. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, defeating Hillary Clinton by almost 23,000 votes. In 2020, Joe Biden turned the state back to blue, beating Trump by a similar margin. Ahead of the 2024 election, Jordan spoke with two voting blocs that could help move the margin in either candidate's direction: female Trump supporters and right-leaning swing voters. Jordan, who was just in Wisconsin last month conducting similar focus groups, said she was shocked at the burst of energy Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy had injected into the race — among both Trump supporters and swing voters. The group of Trump supporters told Jordan they feared the Democratic ticket shake-up could lower Trump’s chances of retaking the White House, since they believe Harris could motivate young, minority and female voters to head to the polls. “Everyone is excited about her, and that scares me,"" one voter shared. Asked how they view Harris’ competence and experience compared to Biden, voters said they saw the vice president as worse. One woman called out Harris for her role in the administration's immigration policy: ""She doesn't even know what's going on at the border, and that's what she was supposed to be in charge of? I mean, as a schoolteacher, if I didn't do what I was supposed to be doing, you better believe my job would be in jeopardy."" Another voter took aim at Harris' intelligence, calling her an ""idiot"" and ""not real smart."" The voters also expressed doubt over the possible election outcome. Asked whether a Harris victory in November would be an ""honest result,"" the entire group shook their heads at Jordan. As for right-leaning swing voters, the group said they had concerns about both Harris and Trump. One voter told Jordan she was open to voting for Harris but felt ""uneasy"" over how much the vice president may have known about Biden's mental and physical fitness. She said if Harris was ""willing to hide that type of information"" about Biden, ""what she’s willing to hide for herself?” As for their views of the former president, a voter told Jordan she couldn't ignore Trump's criminal convictions. She also had issues with his integrity and moral character, suggesting Trump could use the office to ""retaliate"" against his enemies. Another voter voiced shared concern over Trump’s “making too aggressive of choices” and acting out of impulse. However, she also worried Harris could be too cautious in responding to threats and make the U.S. appear ""weak."" One swing voter had a message for both candidates: “It would just be nice if they concentrate more on the issues instead of the mudslinging and personal attacks. ... Let’s try to find that common ground where we can agree on things. Let’s start with that.”"
17,The Secret Service failed Trump. They can’t fail Harris too.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 14:57:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/secret-service-president-assassination-trump-harris-rcna163421,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 23 episode of ""The Last Word."" With just over 100 days until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris spent her first day as the presumptive nominee for president of the Democratic Party on the campaign trail in the crucial electoral college state of Wisconsin. Harris’ Secret Service detail, which was already very strong, should now be strengthened  — not just because she has moved up from vice presidential nominee to presidential nominee, but because we have seen recent proof of Secret Service protection not being strong enough. The director of the Secret Service resigned Tuesday after being sharply questioned by both Democrats and Republicans in a congressional hearing about how a lone gunman was allowed to get on a roof within range of a presidential candidate and fire shots that could have killed the candidate and did kill one of the spectators and wounded two others. That is the first time in history that a Secret Service director has resigned after shots were fired, even though every single time shots have been fired at a president since the creation of the Secret Service, after Abraham Lincoln’s presidency, it has always been the Secret Service’s fault. Every time.  In every single shooting, the Secret Service made the mistake of giving the shooters a clear shot. In 1901, the Secret Service allowed an assassin to walk right up to President William McKinley to shake his hand and instead revealed a handgun shooting the president to death. Congress had no hard questions for Secret Service Director John Wilkie after that, and the Secret Service director served another 10 years in that job after failing to protect the life of President McKinley. In 1933, two weeks before his inauguration, an assassin approached President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s car in Florida and fired shots that missed him but killed a mayor who was standing on the running board of the president-elect’s car. Once again, the Secret Service let an assassin with a gun get too close to the president-elect. Roosevelt was riding in an open car. It was an easy shot because it was an open car. The world was lucky that the assassin missed. Congress did not grill Secret Service Director William Moran who allowed that assassin to get so close to the president. Congress did not ask why Moran allowed the president-elect to ride in an open car. Moran served three more years as Secret Service director and continued to allow Roosevelt to ride fully exposed in an open car, which Roosevelt did throughout his presidency. Thirty years after those shots were fired at Roosevelt, shots fired at President John Fitzgerald Kennedy riding in the back of an open car took the life of the youngest president in history. As pieces of the president’s skull and brain tissue fell onto the surface of the open car behind President Kennedy’s head, his wife tried to reach back to grab those pieces while the fully incompetent Secret Service began climbing onto the back of the limousine and urging the first lady to stay in the car.       It was only after Kennedy was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, that afternoon that Secret Service Director James Rowley decided the president should never again ride in an open car. And no president ever has, since that day. If Rowley had made that decision one day before, American history would be so much less tragic. Rowley served 10 more years as Secret Service director after losing Kennedy on his watch because of his incompetence. Kennedy’s younger brother Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 while running for president.  The Secret Service provided protection to presidential candidates starting the day after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Bobby Kennedy’s assassin was able to walk up to him and shoot him point blank.  In 1975, the Secret Service allowed President Gerald Ford to be shot at twice within two weeks. Stuart Knight was the director of the Secret Service then. He allowed people with no firearms training to simply get too close to the president.  He’s the only Secret Service director in history who allowed the same president to be shot at twice. But he wasn’t finished. He became the only Secret Service director in history to allow two different presidents to be shot at.  He was in charge when the Secret Service allowed another completely untrained pedestrian with a handgun to walk up and get close enough to President Ronald Reagan to fire shots as the president was entering the Washington Hilton. In that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed the president’s press secretary to be shot. And in that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed a Secret Service agent to be shot. All because the Secret Service and Secret Service directors had not yet figured out how to prevent pedestrians from randomly walking up to presidents and firing handguns at them.  There was no condemnation of Knight after the Gerald Ford shootings — two in one month — or the Ronald Reagan shooting. He left the Secret Service after eight years as director.  The Secret Service got marginally better after some of these shootings. No more open cars. No more people allowed to get close to a president moving on foot in or out of a building.  And now the Secret Service thinks it has figured out how to protect Donald Trump at his rallies. The Washington Post reports that the Secret Service urged the Trump campaign to “stop scheduling large outdoor rallies and other outdoor events with big crowds.”  But at the outdoor rally in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to do the elementary thing of securing every possible elevated firing position. The roof it decided not to secure was the roof the murderer used to fire at the candidate and his supporters. It was, as usual, the Secret Service’s fault.

18,Trump's defamation case against ABC after Carroll verdict can proceed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 14:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-defamation-abc-e-jean-carroll-verdict-rcna163499,"After Donald Trump was found liable last year for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, the federal judge overseeing that New York case explained that the jury had essentially found that Trump had raped her, as that term is commonly understood. Nonetheless, a federal judge in Florida has allowed Trump’s defamation claim against ABC and George Stephanopoulos to proceed, based on the anchor’s use of the term “rape” to describe the jury’s verdict. Here’s why. As a refresher, the Carroll jury found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed her, but it didn’t find that Trump had raped her. The New York federal judge who presided over that case, Lewis Kaplan, downplayed the distinction when he rejected Trump’s challenge to the jury’s multimillion dollar award as excessive, reasoning that just because the jury declined to find that Carroll had been raped under New York law, that didn’t mean she failed to prove Trump raped her “as many people commonly understand the word.” Kaplan likewise rejected Trump’s defamation claim against Carroll for her saying that he had raped her. This new decision stems from Stephanopoulos’ March interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in which he questioned her support for Trump despite him being “found liable for rape.” Stephanopoulos repeated that phrase several times during the interview. ABC and Stephanopoulos argued that the former president’s defamation claim is foreclosed by the New York court’s findings. But on Wednesday, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the Southern District of Florida rejected the defense motion to dismiss Trump’s case. (If Altonaga’s name sounds familiar, that may be because the George W. Bush appointee reportedly urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to step aside from Trump’s classified documents case.) In Trump’s defamation suit, Altonaga distinguished Carroll’s claim that Trump had raped her from Stephanopoulos’ characterization of the jury verdict as having found that Trump had raped her. The judge determined that a reasonable jury could interpret the anchor’s statements as defamatory. Yet, she made clear that she wasn’t necessarily agreeing that Trump had been defamed; rather, the judge’s legal determination was that the defense didn’t present a strong enough argument to dismiss Trump’s case at this stage of litigation. “Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan’s reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos’s statements were not defamatory,” Altonaga wrote, adding that a jury that views the segment may find sufficient context to conclude Trump wasn’t defamed.  In some respects, the ruling is like another recent Trump defamation win in Florida. In that state court case, he beat a motion to dismiss his claim against Pulitzer Prize Board members and staff, related to a statement about his 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia. As with the Carroll-related claim, the rejection of that motion to dismiss doesn’t mean that Trump will ultimately prevail — only that his case can proceed.

19,Trump camp denies nephew's allegation that Donald Trump used racial slur,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 13:59:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-racial-slur-fred-trump-iii-nephew-book-rcna163500,"A new book by Donald Trump’s nephew Fred Trump III, a real estate executive, recounts an incident in which the presidential candidate allegedly used a racial slur after his car was damaged. The allegation appears in Fred Trump’s book, ""All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way,"" and is cited to offer insight into the ways in which Donald Trump has allegedly engaged in overt racism.  As The Guardian reported, based on an advance copy of the book the outlet obtained ahead of its release next week:  In response to the report, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told NBC News, “This is completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order.” Trump has faced previous allegations by his family that he’s used racial slurs. Mary Trump, Fred Trump III’s sister, published a book in 2020 that alleged Trump was known to use racist and antisemitic slurs. She told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow at the time that the N-word was among the slurs her uncle used. A spokesperson for Trump’s White House called Mary Trump's book at the time ""a book of falsehoods, plain and simple” and said Trump “doesn’t use those words.” Trump’s team has also had to bat away similar claims made by nonfamily members. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former Trump business associate and White House aide, claimed in 2018 that she’d personally heard a tape of Trump using the N-word during filming of NBC’s “The Apprentice”; Manigault Newman repeated the claim in her book published that year. As with the allegations made by Trump’s niece and nephew, this allegation of racism was disputed — at the time by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who dismissed the former aide as “a disgruntled former White House employee"" who was “trying to profit off these false attacks.” And a former ""Apprentice"" producer, Bill Pruitt, published an essay in Slate this year in which he said he was present to hear the former president use the N-word during the show's first season (Cheung disputed Pruitt's account in a statement to Slate, saying, “This is a completely fabricated and bull---- story that was already peddled in 2016”). Much of Trump's racist behavior and racist rhetoric has been public and well documented over the years. This latest allegation from his nephew — taken together with previous allegations — suggests his private persona might be a bit more bigoted than his public one."
20,CREW’s call for Alito to step down highlights his recusal failures in Trump cases,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 10:32:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/crew-resign-justice-samuel-alito-supreme-court-trump-rcna163415,"Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has called on Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to resign, citing his failure to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, including the Donald Trump immunity ruling. The watchdog group’s letter won’t sway the justice, but it highlights the problem of Alito’s having participated in these crucial disputes. The letter, dated Tuesday, notes that Alito declined to recuse after it emerged that flags carried at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, also flew outside of his homes: CREW cited three cases: • Trump v. United States, the immunity ruling. • Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. • Trump v. Anderson, the ruling that kept Trump on the ballot despite the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban. Alito was in the majority for all three — as was Justice Clarence Thomas, who, unlike Alito, never attempted to explain his nonrecusals, despite his wife’s connection to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. We can safely assume that Alito won’t be resigning — at least not because of this letter. The GOP-appointed justice is in his mid-70s and would probably want to retire under a Republican administration so Republicans could confirm his successor. So when Alito (and Thomas, also in his mid-70s) voluntarily leaves the court may depend partly on whether the litigant he’s been helping returns to the White House in November.

21,Elon Musk now denies he's donating $45 million a month to help Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 10:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-trump-donation-45-million-pac-rcna163404,"Elon Musk has denied that he is contributing $45 million a month to a pro-Donald Trump political action committee, saying he is instead donating ""at a much lower level” than was initially reported. “What’s been reported in the media is simply not true. I’m not donating $45 million a month to Trump,” Musk said in an interview with Jordan Peterson, a conservative Canadian pop psychologist and YouTube personality, posted Monday on X, the social media site that Musk owns. Musk said he created the America PAC not as a “hyper-partisan” group but to “promote the principles that make America great in the first place.” Those principles, he said, include meritocracy and freedom, which he defined as “the least amount of government intervention possible,” a condition without which “everything becomes illegal.” The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Musk was planning to donate around $45 million a month to America PAC. In response to the reporting, Musk appeared at the time to give mixed signals. He responded to the WSJ article on X with a picture of gnus with human legs and the caption, “FAKE GNUS.” But he also replied to a post claiming he is “pledging $180 million” to re-elect Trump — the equivalent of $45 million a month from July until November — writing, “Yeah.” Later on Tuesday, Musk posted on X that he is “making some donations to America PAC, but at a much lower level.” The acerbic Silicon Valley billionaire had publicly thrown his support behind Trump after the attempt on the former president’s life at a campaign rally July 13. The Journal's report about Musk's monthly contributions to the super PAC underscored the financial heft behind the efforts by Silicon Valley's increasingly right-leaning factions to shore up their candidate of choice. At a rally in Michigan this week, Trump himself vowed “to make life good” for people like Musk. (Read more from my colleague Ja’han Jones about Trump’s overtures to Musk.) He also boasted about the tech billionaire’s donations to him. “Elon endorsed me the other day, and I read — I didn’t even know this, he didn’t even tell me about it,” Trump said, “but he gives me $45 million a month.”"
22,"Eyeing new polls, Team Trump pushes flawed ‘Harris Honeymoon’ memo",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 06:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-polls-2024-trump-election-kamala-harris-honeymoon-memo-rcna163401,"It’ll probably be a few days before many of the leading polling outlets release new data on the 2024 presidential race, but in the wake of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal announcement — which was just three days ago — there are some preliminary survey numbers to kick around from polls conducted after Sunday’s news. The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll, for example, found Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by 4 points, 42% to 38%, with third-party candidates in the mix, and by 2 points, 44% to 42%, in a head-to-head match-up with the former Republican president. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) The latest national NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, meanwhile, showed the Democratic VP tied with Trump in a multicandidate field, and in a head-to-head match-up, the GOP nominee was ahead by the narrowest of margins, 46% to 45%.(Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) It was against this backdrop that one of the former president’s pollsters thought it’d be a good idea to issue a memo on where things currently stand. HuffPost reported: “The coverage will be largely positive and will certainly energize Democrats and some other parts of their coalition at least in the short term,” Fabrizio wrote in his memo. “That means we will start to see public polling — particularly national public polls — where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump.” The document added that Harris is seeing a “bump” in the polls now, and this is likely to “last a while until the race settles back down.” At face value, there’s nothing especially wrong with Fabrizio’s analysis. There’s also no great mystery about the pollster’s motivation: With Biden out of the race and Trump’s advantage in national surveys slipping away, it stands to reason that the Republican’s top polling expert would issue a document that, for all intents and purposes, tells his party — and his client — “Don’t panic. This is temporary.” There is, however, a relevant detail that the memo downplayed: where Team Trump expected to be at this point. Ahead of the recent presidential debate, the GOP nominee was already well positioned in the 2024 race. After the debate, his advantage grew. Then Trump was shot, the former president named his running mate and the Republican National Convention soon followed. Right about now, in other words, most political observers — in both parties — would expect to see Trump’s lead reaching new heights. But it’s not, thanks in part to Biden’s willingness to put the country’s needs first, and in part to Democrats rallying behind Harris with great enthusiasm. The fact that the vice president is getting a “bump” isn’t a huge problem for the Republican ticket and its allies; the fact that Team Trump expected to be riding high as July came to an end, however, is far more significant."
23,"Team Harris stresses prosecutorial record, calls Trump a criminal",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 11:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-harris-prosecutorial-record-calls-trump-criminal-election-2024-rcna164333,"At an event late last week, Donald Trump declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” he said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” In context, Trump appeared to be referring to migrants hoping to enter the United States, but there was a degree of irony hanging overhead. In a little more than a year, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case, a different jury held him liable for sexual abuse, and a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. A little self-awareness goes a long way, and by any reasonable measure, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal” is a phrase the GOP nominee probably ought to avoid. It was against this backdrop that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign made its first big ad buy of the cycle, investing $50 million in support of a spot called “Fearless.” The minute-long commercial is worth watching in its entirety, but of particular interest was the opening message in the spot. “As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,” the narrator tells viewers. “As California’s attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners.” The ad goes on from there, but from the outset, the message was unambiguous: Team Harris wants voters to know about her background in law enforcement, and her role in locking up criminals. A day earlier, the incumbent vice president’s political operation sent a news release to reporters on crime, noting not only the significant improvement in crime rates during the Democratic administration, but also saying plainly: “Our opponent Donald Trump is a criminal.” A campaign spokesperson added, “On crime and the border: Donald Trump’s lies are not facts and Donald Trump’s angry rants are not results. Under Trump, America saw unprecedented violence, ineptitude, and division. Right now, America is stronger and safer because of the work of the Biden-Harris administration: Violent crime is at record lows, the border is more secure, and unlike Donald Trump, the vice president is committed to enforcing the law, not breaking it.” The former president talks about crime as if it’s a campaign issue on which he has an advantage, despite his felonious past. It appears his assumptions are being tested. At a campaign rally last week, Trump told an audience that the Democratic campaign was telling the electorate, “‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’” He added, “I don’t think people are going to buy it.” The trouble, of course, is that the message has the benefit of being true. As for whether voters will buy it or not, we’ll find out in about 98 days."
24,Project 2025’s plot for a Trump DOJ takeover,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 11:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-doj-fbi-trump-power-rcna164165,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 28 episode of “Velshi.” Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department begins with a bit of a tell: ""Not reforming the Department of Justice will also guarantee the failure of that conservative Administration’s agenda in countless other ways.” A common misconception held by Donald Trump while he was president was that the Justice Department worked for him, not for the American people. Chapter 17 seeks to make that misconception true. Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation and architect of Project 2025, is already on board with Trump’s perspective. In January, he told The New York Times, “[W]e just disagree wholly that the Department of Justice is independent of the president or the executive branch.” Now, Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for a second Trump term isn't an easy read. The words and sentences are deliberately confusing. But make no mistake, Project 2025 calls for a Justice Department working in lockstep with a potential Trump administration. That means if Trump is re-elected, the branch tasked with independently and impartially upholding the rule of law will be in the hands of a man convicted of 34 felony counts, who has promised revenge and retribution against his personal enemies. What could possibly go wrong? Let’s start with Project 2025's plans for the FBI, which is a branch within the Justice Department. While president, Trump was supremely frustrated by his inability to control the FBI. He wanted desperately for the agency to drop its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. So it follows that Project 2025 would encourage the next conservative administration to place the FBI under more “politically accountable” leadership — code words for “loyal to the president.” It also wants the FBI to stop investigating online misinformation, a new initiative that feels more important than ever. The agency wouldn't investigate police misconduct, either. Another hidden detail in Chapter 17 is the call to “Promptly and properly eliminate ... all existing consent decrees.” The Justice Department typically hands down consent decrees to local jurisdictions after investigations into police wrongdoing — think of them like court-ordered improvement plans. These decrees usually compel jails to improve their conditions or police departments to consider their tactics and report back to the Justice Department. Project 2025 argues the Justice Department should “disclaim” its ability to hand down consent decrees. Another target of this chapter is local and state attorneys who use their own discretion to pursue or not pursue prosecution. Project 2025 calls for the Justice Department to “initiate legal action against local officials—including District Attorneys—who deny American citizens the ‘equal protection of the laws’ by refusing to prosecute criminal offenses in their jurisdictions.” This would be a radical departure from the norm, and it goes against the very purpose of local district attorneys. As the Marshall Project's Jamiles Lartey explains, “Choosing which cases to pursue and which to drop is a core responsibility of prosecution, and one of the arguments for the local election of district attorneys is that communities may have different priorities on how these choices get made.” But no such quarter would be given in a second Trump term. If you’d prefer a Justice Department that will defend and uphold voting rights, I have bad news for you: Project 2025 would reorient the federal government’s role from upholding voting rights to suppressing them. It takes specific aim at so-called mail-in ballot fraud and other types of voting and registration that became targets of The Big Lie: “With respect to the 2020 presidential election, there were no DOJ investigations of the appropriateness or lawfulness of state election guidance. ... The Pennsylvania Secretary of State should have been (and still should be) investigated and prosecuted for potential violations.” That paragraph explicitly targets a specific official whom Trump blames for his 2020 election loss. Again, what could go wrong? If implemented, Project 2025’s new-era Justice Department would cement long-standing grudges Trump holds against the various legal guardrails he crashed into during his four years in office and in the years since, and it would mutate the Justice Department into nothing more than a crude beating stick for Trump and his allies to use against their perceived enemies."
25,Trump’s ‘won’t have to vote anymore’ remarks sounded just like his authoritarian idols,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 10:25:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-wont-vote-remarks-reflect-authoritarian-idols-rcna164167,"Legal scholar Dahlia Lithwick’s sobering comments after the Supreme Court gave Donald Trump broad immunity from prosecution have stuck with me ever since. “As an official representative of the legal commentariat I want to suggest that tonight’s a good news cycle to talk to the fascism and authoritarianism experts,” she tweeted July 1, the day of the ruling. “This is their inning now...” Those words came to my mind over the weekend as Trump was going viral for telling supporters that they “won’t have to vote anymore” in four years because “it’ll be fixed” — remarks that sure sounded like a clear signal that Trump is planning to end democracy if he’s elected president again. I think sometimes people can foolishly minimize such statements from Trump as if they simply reflect a thirst for power. But I doubt we’ve ever had a presidential hopeful as eager as Trump is to fawn over authoritarians. In fact, Trump was given multiple opportunities to explain his concerning comment on Monday night but failed to do so. So I think we should heed Lithwick’s advice and take a look at these strongman idols. Trump has praised the likes of China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. But his party is currently enamored with some lesser-known authoritarians, too, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele. And I question, sometimes, whether people know what kind of governance the MAGA movement is motioning toward with this. Orbán has railed against “mixed-race” countries and touted his vision of an “illiberal state.” His government has consolidated control of media outlets, and his Fidesz party has used gerrymandering to seemingly draw itself into power indefinitely. The party once sought to give parents more voting power than people without children — a plan that Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, pushed in 2021.  Bukele — El Salvador’s self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world” — is another favorite among American conservatives. He once ordered armed soldiers into parliament to pressure lawmakers. He has waged a violent crackdown on gangs, alarming human rights observers, and used that crusade to justify censoring the press. He also stacked El Salvador’s top court, which struck down a seeming constitutional ban on consecutive presidential terms. When you consider such actions against the backdrop of Trump’s repeated antidemocratic statements, it’s more than appropriate for us to consider how he just might try — if he wins in November — to achieve the kind of power his idols have."
26,Trump defends JD Vance's 'childless cat ladies' comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 09:44:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-rcna164236,"Donald Trump is trying to do some damage control as the fallout from his running mate’s comments about “childless cat ladies” continues. In an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham that aired Monday night, Trump defended Sen. JD Vance, saying his vice presidential pick's past attacks on women without children were simply due to his love for family. “He made a statement having to do with families,” Trump said. “That doesn’t mean people that aren’t a member of a big and beautiful family with 400 children around and everything else — it doesn’t mean that a person doesn’t have — he’s not against anything, but he loves family. It’s very important to him.” The GOP presidential nominee pointed to Vance’s “interesting family situation,” which the Ohio senator documented in his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” “He feels family is good. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong in saying that,” Trump said, accusing Democrats of “spinning things differently.” Vance's questionable views on family and women have come under scrutiny in recent weeks. Trump’s attempt to portray his running mate’s past comments as innocuous is not exactly convincing, given the disdain with which the Ohio senator himself spoke about women without children. Vance lamented to Fox News in 2021 that the country was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Vance’s comments have provoked intense backlash from Democrats and risk jeopardizing the Republican presidential ticket’s support among undecided voters, including women. Last week, Vance himself went on the defensive, saying in an interview that his “childless cat ladies” barb was part of his argument that Democrats are “anti-family and anti-child.” “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment,” he said. “I’ve got nothing against cats.”"
27,What the Trump immunity ruling says about the Roberts Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 09:25:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-roberts-court-rcna164239,"Throughout the Donald Trump immunity litigation leading up to the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this month, questions abounded over whether the court would step in to decide the issue, when it would do so, and how — including whether the court might achieve a unanimous opinion on presidential power as it had historically. When we finally saw the decision on July 1, we learned that the court was far from unanimous in Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion granting Trump (and other former presidents) broad criminal immunity. A new report sheds light on the court’s deliberations and Roberts’ further rightward shift, suggesting that a partisan divide on presidential immunity was seemingly inevitable under the chief justice’s leadership. The report by CNN chief Supreme Court analyst and Roberts biographer Joan Biskupic, which hasn’t been confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC, recounted that sources familiar with the court’s deliberations said “there was an immediate and clear 6-3 split” in the case. Biskupic reported that Roberts “made no serious effort to entice the three liberal justices for even a modicum of the cross-ideological agreement that distinguished such presidential-powers cases in the past. He believed he could persuade people to look beyond Trump.” Roberts reportedly declined to respond to CNN’s questions about the recent term and this case.  To recap, the court could’ve taken up the immunity issue in December, when special counsel Jack Smith asked the justices to do so at an earlier stage of litigation in the federal election interference case. The court declined. After the federal appeals court ruled against Trump, the high court granted review of his appeal in February but didn’t schedule a hearing until the last argument day of the term in late April — in fact, the court scheduled a new last day for the immunity case. The July 1 ruling came on the final decision day of the term, months out from the presidential election whose outcome could lead to Trump crushing his federal cases if he wins.  It was a 6-3 ruling, with Republican appointees in the majority, though Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett disagreed with part of Roberts’ opinion that curbed the use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of private conduct. That part of the ruling has called into question Trump’s New York state guilty verdicts, which weren’t at issue in his federal election interference appeal. President Joe Biden just called for a constitutional amendment — the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment” — to counteract the ruling. So, what does Roberts’ handling of the immunity appeal tell us about him and his court? Biskupic wrote that the chief justice “appears to have abandoned his usual institutional concerns.” That’s one way to look at it.  Another is that his institutionalist reputation has long been overblown, at least when it comes to his rulings — which, to be sure, haven’t always represented the furthest right flank of the court, such as his concurring opinion in Dobbs, which wouldn’t have overturned Roe v. Wade; the other five Republican-appointed justices accomplished that without him. But that may say more about the fact that this far-right court doesn’t need Roberts’ vote to achieve its ends. The immunity episode, then, suggests that the chief justice is not only eager to be in on the court’s rightward march but wants to lead the way.

28,Trump pressed for answers after saying supporters ‘won’t have to vote’ again,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 08:27:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pressed-answers-saying-supporters-wont-vote-rcna164264,"Given Donald Trump’s apparent discomfort with being described as a threat to American democracy, it’s tempting to think the former president would be cautious when talking about voting and elections. And yet the Republican is doing largely the opposite. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly said that he and his political operation “don’t need” votes — a curious comment from a candidate for public office — which has dovetailed with his latest comments that his Christian supporters “won’t have to vote anymore“ if he wins a second term. It was against this backdrop that the GOP nominee sat down yesterday with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, who offered Trump multiple opportunities to clarify matters and explain what he meant. It didn’t go especially well. The host began by saying Trump’s critics are “attacking” him for “ridiculous reasons,” adding, “They’re saying that you said to a crowd of Christians that they won’t have to vote in the future.” Of course, “they” are saying that because Trump really did tell a Christian audience that that they won’t have to vote in the future. Nevertheless, the Republican initially responded by talking about his popularity with Christian voters, before shifting his attention to Jewish voters. Eventually, he doubled down on his controversial comments, explaining that Christians “won’t have to vote anymore” after he’s done “straightening out the country.” It appeared as if the Fox anchor simply wanted Trump to say that he supports democracy and future elections, but the former president apparently didn’t get the hint. On the contrary, he largely echoed the same point all over again, saying that his “simple” message to Christian voters is, “You have to vote on November 5th. After that, you don’t have to worry about voting anymore.” At that point, Trump added, “We won’t even need your vote anymore.” It would’ve been very easy for him to say, “Of course we’ll have elections in the future, and of course Americans will be encouraged to participate in their own democratic system.” But that’s not what he said — despite having opportunities to do so. Following up on our coverage from yesterday, one possible interpretation of Trump’s rhetoric is that he wants the public to believe that by the end of his prospective second term, his far-right vision will be so entrenched in the American system that it will be effectively election-proof. MAGA world will endure for the indefinite future, the argument goes, so whether the Republican’s followers vote or not in 2028 will be irrelevant — because there will be nothing Democrats can do to reverse what’s been done. The less charitable interpretation is that Trump envisions a future without elections. For his part, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas insisted on Sunday that the former president was “obviously making a joke“ with his controversial comments. At no point during Trump’s interview with Fox’s Ingraham did he say he was kidding."

The first came several weeks ago when the Louisiana congressman had to choose two new members of the House Intelligence Committee — and as members of both parties came to agree, Johnson did not choose wisely. His second personnel challenge came this week, and by some measures, the House speaker’s newest failure was even more dramatic than his first. The Washington Post reported: To be sure, there is no controversy surrounding the existence of this new congressional task force. There’s broad support for investigating the attempt on Trump’s life, and the official inquiry will move forward with bipartisan backing. But as the process advances, it’s worth pausing to consider who Johnson appointed to the panel. Indeed, it’s difficult to pick which of the task force’s GOP members is the most controversial. Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, for example, is an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and who’s also faced some unfortunate ethics questions. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee is also an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and his right-wing background was so controversial in 2017 that the Senate wouldn’t confirm him when Trump nominated him to serve as secretary of the Army. The panel will be chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who, in addition to being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, is also up to his ears in the fake elector scandal; has accused Barack Obama of running a secret “shadow government”; and initially responded to the recent assassination attempt targeting Trump by describing it without evidence as an “attack from the left.” But perhaps most notable of all is Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana — an election denier who’s also taken a leading role in concocting deeply weird conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, including bizarre allegations related to the FBI and “ghost buses.” As a recent New York Times report summarized, “Even by a conspiracy theorist’s standards, the wild claims made by Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, stand out.” Some might see this and question the relevance. Perhaps, the argument goes, these House Republicans pushed ridiculous conspiracy theories related to the 2020 elections and the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, but this investigation is about the shooting that nearly killed Trump. It is, some might argue, an entirely unrelated matter. Perhaps, but judgment matters. The shooting in Pennsylvania was deadly serious and deserves to be scrutinized by credible and responsible members of Congress who care about evidence and reality. The goal is to produce findings that the American public will be able to believe. For Johnson to choose fringe figures such as Higgins for this task force was an avoidable mistake."
30,Mark Meadows cites Trump immunity ruling in his own Supreme Court appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 06:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/meadows-cites-trump-immunity-ruling-supreme-court-rcna164160,"The full effect of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling on Donald Trump’s criminal cases isn’t yet known, saying nothing of its implications for the future of the presidency and the country. But while the application of Trump v. United States is slowly playing out in the GOP presidential nominee’s cases, another beneficiary of the ruling may be his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Meadows cites the July 1 ruling several times in his new Supreme Court petition, seeking the justices’ help in moving his Georgia state 2020 election interference case to federal court. Both the federal trial and appeals courts rejected Meadows’ claim, with the latter deciding that federal officer removal isn’t even available to former officers like Meadows and that, even if it was, his Georgia charges don’t relate to his official duties so he needs to stay in state court. Represented by top conservative lawyer Paul Clement at the Supreme Court, Meadows calls the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling “egregiously wrong, wholly unprecedented, and exceptionally dangerous,” arguing that “what matters is a federal officer’s status at the time of the conduct at issue, not her status at the time the prosecutor or plaintiff gets around to filing suit.” Even before the high court majority bestowed broad immunity on his former boss, there was reason to think that the justices might take interest in Meadows’ case. The 11th Circuit admittedly broke new ground in its ruling, with the three-judge appeals court panel acknowledging that “in the 190-year history of the federal-officer removal statute, no court has ruled that former officers are excluded from removal.” Notably, that appellate ruling was authored by a jurist well-respected in conservative circles, the circuit’s chief judge, William Pryor. Also notable is that the two Democratic-appointed judges on the panel agreed with the legal outcome but wrote separately to lament the “nightmare scenario” of not extending removal to former officers, arguing that “not extending the federal-officer removal statute to former officers for prosecutions based on their official actions during their tenure is bad policy, and it represents a potential threat to our republic’s stability.” To be sure, they noted that Meadows’ case still shouldn’t go to federal court even if former officers could get removal, because he “has not established that the State has charged him for or relating to an act under color of his office as White House chief of staff.” Nonetheless, to address their broader concerns, they called on Congress to amend the law to expressly include former officers. “The far better course is for this Court to intervene,” Meadows urged the justices in the petition, citing the Trump immunity ruling for, among other things, the proposition that “federal protections cannot prevent the distortion of federal decisionmaking by current officeholders if they expire as soon as they leave office, as this Court reiterated just this past Term.” The Georgia state prosecution brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis against Trump, Meadows (they’ve both pleaded not guilty) and others is currently on hold pending a separate pretrial appeal over the defense attempt to disqualify Willis. Meadows’ petition adds yet another wrinkle if the justices’ agree to review his appeal. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

31,‘Duckin’ Don’: Team Harris ridicules Trump over new debate dodge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/duckin-don-team-harris-ridicules-trump-new-debate-dodge-2024-election-rcna164227,"It was nearly three months ago when Donald Trump and his campaign team agreed to participate in some presidential debates, including an event on Sept. 10, shortly before early voting begins in some states. At the time, of course, the Republican and his political operation assumed he’d share a stage with President Joe Biden. They now know better — and their willingness to honor the original schedule is, at a minimum, in flux. Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed-upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’d been a candidate for less than a week. The likely Democratic nominee went a little further yesterday, explaining that she will, in fact, be on the stage for the event, whether her GOP rival agrees to participate or not. “We’ll see if Trump shows,” Harris’ spokesperson added. As things stand, the odds of Trump agreeing to another general election debate aren’t great. The Associated Press reported on the former president’s latest comments on the subject, aired last night on Fox News. Fox’s Laura Ingraham pressed him on this point several times, and the Republican nominee kept hedging. Trump said he “likes” debating and “wants” to debate Harris, before adding, “But I also can say this: Everybody knows who I am.” When the host asked, “Why not debate her?” Trump didn’t contest the premise of the question. He instead replied, “Because [voters] already know everything.” The former president added that if he agreed to the Sept. 10 debate, it would “reward fake news,” and he’s against making ABC News “rich.” These were not the words of someone who seems eager to share a debate stage with Harris. With this in mind, let’s recap recent events. July 21: Within hours of Biden ending his 2024 candidacy, Trump started hedging on a possible debate and complaining about ABC News, despite the fact that his campaign team had already agreed to have ABC News host the next event. July 23: Trump doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later in the day, he told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate Harris, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything.” July 25: Aides to Trump said they wouldn’t commit to another debate. July 29: Trump appeared on Fox News and hedged some more, arguing that he “can also make a case for not doing it.” After the interview aired, the Harris campaign issued a press release with a headline that referred to the former president as “Duckin’ Don.” The statement from the vice president’s spokesperson added, “Why won’t Donald Trump give a straight answer on debating Vice President Harris? It’s clear from tonight’s question-dodging: He’s scared he’ll have to defend his running mate’s weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president. Vice President Harris will be on the debate stage September 10th. Donald Trump can show up, or not.” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
32,Trump and Vance’s terrible week was brought to you by TPUSA,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 12:05:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/turning-point-usa-trump-vance-tpusa-rcna164113,"For all the talk over the past few years about Donald Trump making the Republican Party in his image, it seems increasingly clear to me that he is merely the useful figurehead of a right-wing movement led by activists like Charlie Kirk and others in his well-heeled organization, Turning Point USA. I’ve written a lot about the GOP’s deference to Kirk and his extremist-friendly organization, which has maintained its conservative clout despite repeatedly backing failed candidates. The past week has underscored TPUSA’s power over Republicans as well as the organization’s inseparable bond with Trump and his inner circle, as two controversies surrounding Trump’s campaign had connections to TPUSA. In a speech Friday, Trump claimed that if he’s elected, Christian voters won’t need to vote in 2028 because everything will be “fixed.” These illiberal remarks give the clear impression that Trump is forecasting the end of democracy. And notably, he made these comments at a TPUSA-sponsored event for Christians known as “The Believers’ Summit.” And this came mere days after it was revealed that Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, had written a glowing review for a book written by far-right commentator Jack Posobiec — a Turning Point contributor who is known for his promotion of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory. Posobiec’s book portrays liberals as “unhumans.” As HuffPost reported: These connections between Turning Point USA and the GOP ticket speak to the extremism undergirding the MAGA movement — and TPUSA’s stranglehold on the Republican Party."
33,"Brazenly flip-flopping, Trump adds crypto to his MAGA agenda",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 10:02:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/brazenly-flip-flopping-trump-adds-crypto-maga-agenda-rcna164108,"Donald Trump tends to use vague language when talking about things he doesn’t understand, but when talking about cryptocurrencies, the Republican was willing to be specific. As regular readers know, the former president has called them a “disaster waiting to happen,” adding that as far as he was concerned, Bitcoin seemed “like a scam.” When it came to crypto, Trump said he was “not a fan,” adding, “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” While in office, he insisted that Bitcoin is “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” And then the evolution started. Ahead of an appearance at the Libertarian Party’s national convention, the GOP nominee declared online in May that he was suddenly “VERY POSITIVE AND OPEN MINDED” on the issue. Around the same time, the former president’s 2024 campaign announced that it would accept donations in cryptocurrency. Last month, one day after Trump met with leaders of several Bitcoin mining companies at Mar-a-Lago, he published a pro-Bitcoin message to his social media platform that he almost certainly didn’t write. In case the flip-flop weren’t quite obvious enough, the Republican removed all doubt over the weekend. The New York Times reported: At times, the audience heard a disjointed message. As he wrapped up his remarks at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, for example, Trump said, “Have a good time with your Bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you’re playing with.” The words of a man who’s given the subject considerable thought, to be sure. Earlier in his remarks, the candidate also asked event attendees to thank him for stopping the Biden administration from doing terrible things to the crypto industry. How, exactly, is Trump standing in the Biden administration’s way? I have no idea, and Trump didn’t say. Perhaps most notably from a policy perspective, the GOP nominee also vowed to create a “national bitcoin stockpile“ for reasons unknown. But with the election in mind, Trump also told his audience that Vice President Kamala Harris intends to wage an “anti-crypto crusade,” as part of an attack against the industry from “left-wing fascists.” What he neglected to say was, “Can you believe Harris is critical of crypto the same way I was before some wealthy donors encouraged me to change my mind?” Indeed, Politico recently published a report with a memorable headline: “Trump keeps flip-flopping his policy positions after meeting with rich people.” Unfortunately, it’s happened quite a bit. For example, Trump supported banning TikTok, only to reverse course after chatting with Jeff Yass, a billionaire hedge fund manager — and prospective campaign donor — who has a multibillion-dollar stake in ByteDance, TikTok’s parent corporation. Something similar appears to have happened with the cryptocurrency industry. Trump also started hedging on some of his immigration policies around the time he met with wealthy corporate executives at a Business Roundtable meeting. A few months earlier, Trump publicly suggested that conservatives should give up on their opposition to Anheuser-Busch shortly before he attended a fundraiser hosted by an Anheuser-Busch lobbyist. It’s tempting to see this as corruption, but it’s worth being more specific about what’s happened. Trump isn’t saying, “I’ll change my position in exchange for money,” he’s instead effectively saying, “Since I don’t care about governing or public policy anyway, I’ll just align my beliefs with my wealthy donors’ preferences.” If recent history is any guide, it’s only a matter of time before this list grows. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
34,"Despite his recent track record, Trump pushes bizarre predictions",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 08:29:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/recent-track-record-donald-trump-bizarre-predictions-election-2024-rcna164080,"Ahead of Election Day 2020, Donald Trump told supporters that a Joe Biden presidency would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” We now know, of course, that the predictions were spectacularly wrong; the United States under Biden has seen a dramatic economic recovery, and Americans are now benefiting from the strongest economy on the planet. In theory, this would be around the time that the former president offered some kind of explanation for being wrong. In practice, Trump is simply recycling the same false predictions. At an event over the weekend, for example, the GOP presidential nominee, pointing to a claim no credible observers have actually made, argued that some believe “if Trump isn’t elected, this country is going to go into a depression the likes of which you had in 1929.” This is, of course, effectively identical to what the Republican predicted four years ago. He was wrong then, and there’s obviously no reason to believe the absurd claim has improved with age. But it’s not just the economy. Trump said crime rates would get worse under Biden, and instead they’ve improved dramatically. On energy policy, in late October 2020, the then-incumbent president declared at a rally that a Biden presidency would mean “no heating in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer, no electricity during peak hours.” Around the same time, Trump told voters: “Under Biden, there will no be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmases, and no Fourth of July.” How’d that one turn out? In August 2020, he also predicted that if Biden were to win, “we will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell.” Four years later, capitalism remains intact, there’s nothing boring about the United States, and I’m pleased to report that the country isn’t going to hell. I don’t doubt that Trump will continue to make ridiculous predictions in the coming months, but sensible observers should take note: This guy’s crystal ball clearly doesn’t work."
35,"Rejecting ‘unity,’ Trump says ‘maybe I’ve gotten worse’ after shooting",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 07:55:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rejecting-unity-trump-says-maybe-ve-gotten-worse-shooting-rcna164064,"Two weeks ago today, Axios reported that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Donald Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added: “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America.” Four days later, Politico published a related report, noting that in the aftermath of the shooting, “Republicans who have observed and spoken with former President Donald Trump say they have detected a new softness to the man whose brand has been anything but.” The article added, “GOP allies, in roughly a dozen interviews, used words like ‘emotional’ and ‘serene’ — even ‘spiritual’ — to describe Trump in the days since the attempt on his life.” Democrats were skeptical. The GOP nominee effectively told a Minnesota audience on Saturday night that his partisan foes were right to question the reporting. The New York Times reported: “I want to be nice,” Mr. Trump said. “They all say, ‘I think he’s changed. I think he’s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him.’” But to a cheering crowd of thousands, Mr. Trump quickly conceded the point. “No, I haven’t changed,” he said. “Maybe I’ve gotten worse.” Let’s not forget that the morning after the attempt on his life, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United.” Hours later, the Republican was even more succinct, adding, “UNITE AMERICA!” This attitude has obviously been thrown out the window, as Trump effectively conceded over the weekend with his “maybe I’ve gotten worse” acknowledgement. On ABC News’ “This Week,” Martha Raddatz asked New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu yesterday about whether Trump is missing an opportunity by abandoning a “unity” focus. “He’s missing it now,” the Republican governor replied, “but hopefully they can get back on track.” What Sununu neglected to mention is that Trump, by all appearances, has absolutely no interest in getting a “unity” focus “back on track.” Consider what happened just two weeks before the 2018 midterm elections. Ten Democratic officials and/or veterans of the Obama administration were targeted with packages containing explosive devices, and soon after, Trump complained that media coverage of “bomb stuff” was interfering with the Republican Party’s election season strategies. Asked whether the mail bombs might lead to a shift in his political tone, the then-president replied: “Tone down? No. Could tone up.” Common sense might’ve suggested a more responsible course. Democrats were targeted with explosives, at which point Trump could’ve at least pretended to care about vitriolic rhetoric. He instead told reporters in the wake of the attempted violence that he was prepared to possibly make the toxic political atmosphere worse — on purpose. Nearly six years later, it seems very little has changed."
36,Why Trump’s dual endorsement in a key Republican primary matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 06:35:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-dual-endorsement-key-republican-primary-matters-rcna164038,"Once in a great while, Donald Trump will look at a primary, size up the Republican candidates, struggle to settle on a favorite, and end up endorsing more than one contender. Two years ago this week, for example, the former president endorsed two leading contenders in a Senate primary in Missouri. As NBC News reported, the GOP’s presidential nominee has done the same thing in a closely watched congressional primary in Arizona, though the circumstances in this race are worth a closer look. “We have a very important Republican Primary Election on Tuesday for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, with two spectacular America First Candidates,” Trump wrote in a message published to his social media platform. “Both Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh have my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Congressman of Arizona’s 8th Congressional District.” At first blush, this might look like a replay of the Missouri race: Trump liked both candidates, so he endorsed both candidates. But in this specific primary, it’s not that simple. This Arizona district, just north of Phoenix, is a Republican stronghold, and it’s generally understood that the winner of the GOP primary is all but certain to win the House seat. It was against this backdrop that Trump publicly endorsed Hamadeh eight months ago, choosing him over Masters, despite the fact that the former president endorsed Masters’ ill-fated Senate candidacy two years ago. Nevertheless, as the local congressional primary has unfolded, Masters has repeatedly suggested that he enjoyed Trump’s support, pointing to the former president’s 2022 backing. In one campaign ad, for example, viewers were told “TRUMP ENDORSED MASTERS” in bold letters — while a smaller font added, “IN SENATE CAMPAIGN.” It reached the point at which Susie Wiles, Trump’s campaign manager, reportedly called Masters directly about this. Politico reported earlier this month that Wiles urged the Arizonan “to pull or change ads” that falsely implied that he had Trump’s support in his congressional campaign. Three weeks later, Trump extended his support to Masters’ congressional campaign. For Hamadeh, the news was likely a punch to the gut. Hamadeh, who narrowly lost a state attorney general race in the Grand Canyon State in 2022, has based much of his candidacy on the fact that he was the Trump-backed candidate in the primary. And while that’s still the case, as the race approaches the finish line, the former president has apparently decided that Hamadeh is no longer the only Trump-backed candidate in the primary. It’s difficult to speculate as to why, exactly, the Republican made this surprise announcement, but The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump’s relationship with Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel is starting to “thaw,” and Masters is a close Thiel ally. I have a hunch that won’t make Hamadeh feel any better about having to share the former president’s support. Primary Day in Arizona is just 24 hours away."
37,Trump tells supporters they ‘won’t have to vote’ again if he wins,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 05:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tells-supporters-wont-vote-wins-rcna164019,"Democratic arguments that Donald Trump represents a threat to American democracy appears to be the one criticism that the former president considers intolerable. In fact, the Republican has claimed without evidence that this Democratic talking point — which is rooted in fact — might very well have contributed to the recent assassination attempt. But if the GOP candidate doesn’t want to be seen as a threat to American democracy, he probably ought to stop taking public stances that make it seem as he’s a threat to American democracy. The New York Times reported: This might sound hyperbolic. It’s not. “Christians, get out and vote — just this time,” the Republican said at the Turning Point USA Believers Summit. “You won’t have to do it anymore! Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” For good measure, he went on say, “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” To be sure, the former president has made similar comments in the very recent past. Just last week, for example, Trump told a far-right audience, “In four years you don’t have to vote, ok? In four years don’t vote, I don’t care.” But his remarks from late Friday were even less subtle — and even more unsettling. If we’re being charitable, there is a potentially benign interpretation of the candidate’s comments, though even this is far from reassuring. Perhaps Trump meant that, at the end of his prospective second term, his far-right vision will be so entrenched in the American system that it will be effectively election-proof. MAGA world will endure for the indefinite future, the argument goes, so whether the Republican’s followers vote or not in 2028 will be irrelevant — because there will be nothing Democrats can do to reverse what’s been done. The less charitable interpretation is that Trump envisions a future without elections. Or as Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman put it, “The only way ‘you won’t have to vote anymore’ is if Donald Trump becomes a dictator.” The New York congressman’s choice of words was especially notable given that Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating what he’s pitched as a temporary American “dictatorship.” The former president has also talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, rejecting election results he doesn’t like, creating militarized camps, issuing pardons for politically aligned criminals, strengthening his friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, pursuing mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions, and arguing that his rivals shouldn't be ""allowed"" to run against him. On ABC News’ “This Week,” Martha Raddatz asked Gov. Chris Sununu — a former critic of the former president who’s now a cheerleader for his party’s ticket — about the former president’s “won’t have to vote anymore” comments. The New Hampshire Republican chuckled before responding, “I think that was a classic Trumpism.” Perhaps. But isn’t that precisely the problem?"
38,Why Trump’s attacks on Kamala Harris will be much nastier than usual,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-28 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-attacks-racism-sexism-rcna163313,"We’re 100 days out from the general election, and if you think Kamala Harris’ candidacy as the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee is unprecedented, wait until you see the unprecedentedly vicious and ugly attacks against her. Of course, former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are always nasty work; that’s to be expected from a loud-mouthed, racist, sexist, petty, congenital liar of a candidate. But Trump has always singled out Black women for his most denigrating abuse. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of misogynoir, which describes the coupled misogyny and racism thrown at Black women, please familiarize yourself, stat, because this election season will be lousy with it. Now that the felonious ex-president must face off against Harris — a biracial Black woman and erstwhile prosecutor nearly 20 years his junior — we’re already seeing disgusting assaults on the vice president’s character that aren’t remotely based in fact. Remember those vile T-shirts, popular with Trump’s supporters earlier in the campaign, that read, “Joe and the Ho Gotta Go”? Expect even more hypersexualization toward Harris by Trump, his surrogates and his MAGA followers. They’re alleging Harris “slept her way to the top” — as Megyn Kelly claimed — referencing her relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who had been separated from his wife for over a decade when he and Harris dated 30 years ago. Those falsehoods are also being paired with claims that Harris is a “DEI hire,” a repurposing of “diversity, equity and inclusion” favored by conservatives who are too media-savvy to use overt slurs. Before becoming multiple firsts as vice president and in Congress, Harris was elected the first woman, first African American and first South Asian attorney general in California history, and served as San Francisco’s first woman and nonwhite district attorney. Her track record easily beats the allegations, but when she proves her rhetorical and intellectual competence against Trump, which will be fun to watch, they’ll try to portray her as a “typical angry Black lady.” These bad-faith allegations will be lodged by people who believe Blackness and womanness, regardless of resume, are inherent markers of unfitness. The terms “militant,” “radical,” “California socialist” and “Marxist” will be in heavy rotation, and Trump’s team will claim Harris, as president, will defund every police department and encourage mass migration to let undocumented immigrants vote in elections for Democrats. Just this week, in fact, Trump advisers boasted to The Bulwark of their strategic plan to “Willie Horton” Harris, a reference to racist campaign ads during the 1988 presidential campaign appealing to white panic over perceptions of Black criminality, which portrayed then-Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as lenient on violent offenders. That messaging will go hand in hand with fearmongering about immigration, with the GOP repeatedly claiming Harris failed as the Biden administration’s “border czar” — a title she never held, which the GOP made up and a complicit media helped proliferate. Numerous Republicans have filed impeachment articles against Harris since she became the presumptive nominee, and they’ll continue in this vein because their base loves a good show, however performative. Their own party thwarted a border security bill early this year because Trump wanted to run on immigration chaos. In any case, border crossings have fallen hugely in recent months, and currently stand near where they were in the final months under Trump’s watch. The Republican Party’s boundless hypocrisy means they’ll contradict themselves at every turn. The same partisans who wanted you to believe Harris slept her way to the top of a major-party ticket will also portray her as a childless, careerist feminazi whose hatred for America’s family model is surpassed only by her passion for funding post-birth abortions. Regardless of how she handles the Israel-Hamas war, some of the same Republicans known to dabble in antisemitism will claim Harris — the first Biden administration official to call for a cease-fire, but also a consistent defender of Israel’s “right to defend itself” — is stridently anti-Jewish. While using a super-racist nickname like, say, “Kamala X,” they’ll insist her Jamaican and Indian immigrant parentage makes her neither Black nor American — a reconfiguring of the racist “birtherism” directed at President Barack Obama. (Misogynoir being what it is, they may also falsely suggest, as they do with former first lady Michelle Obama, that she isn’t really a woman.) She’ll be cast as lax on crime, but also labeled “Kamala the cop,” and since they think Black people are gullible, criminal morons, Trump will trot out rappers while surrogates celebrate his felonies as proof he’s Blacker than Harris. Vivek Ramaswamy and every Black Republican will obligingly repeat these lines to defang any racism accusations. But the most insidious claim of all will be that Harris cannot win. Not only will this messaging come from Trump and Co., but also from lots of other sources. Paid disinformation agents in Russia, which targeted Black voters most intensely in 2016. Red-pilled American trolls clad in digital blackface. And it’ll come from mainstream reporters concern-trolling about her campaign’s divisiveness, or a New York Times article where rural diner patrons are polled on the “scariest” things about Kamala Harris. The result will be a lot of people saying they want to vote for Harris, but they worry that no one else will. But the stats are currently on Harris’ side. In the 48 hours after Harris became the Dems’ presidential nominee, ActBlue raised $81 million, one of its highest one-day tallies in history. Politico reported that during the first 48 hours of her candidacy, Vote.org saw a 700% spike in voter registrations, which outpaces the increase that resulted from a Taylor Swift social media post. Calls organized for Black women, South Asian women, white women, Latinas, Black men and Black LGBTQ men have raised funds and helped galvanize those communities. Harris’ support among Black and Hispanic voters has bested that of Biden’s, by 8% and 6%, respectively. Polls can be fickle things, but the first Reuters/Ipsos poll since Harris became the candidate has her leading Trump, 44% to 42%. The point is, she can absolutely win. Over the next 100 days, we’re going to see horrifying levels of racism and sexism — misogynoir, that is — and it will be terrifyingly mainstream. But don’t give up hope. Vice President Harris has what it takes to beat back those representing the worst instincts of America. She just needs our votes to make it happen."
39,Why Americans shouldn’t buy Trump and Vance’s free speech warrior acts,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-27 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-vance-free-speech-phonies-first-amendment-rcna163102,"Republicans, conservatives and MAGA fellow travelers love to beat their chests about their commitment to free speech. But when it comes to the current leadership of the party, it’s an absurd claim.  Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, got into the free speech act during his July 17 speech at the Republican National Convention when he accepted former President Donald Trump’s nomination to be his 2024 running mate. “Shouldn’t we be governed by a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution? That’s the Republican Party of the next four years, united in our love for this country and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas,” the senator intoned in Milwaukee. Those words would sound great to my civil libertarian ears if I hadn’t already heard them all before.  For all the MAGA posturing about free speech, few political figures are more hostile to free expression than Trump, who every day continues to pad his lengthy resume of trying to silence his critics. And Vance supports some disturbing carveouts to the First Amendment. To cite just a few examples of Vance’s free speech tourism: He told Tucker Carlson that the government ought to seize the assets of nonprofit groups that advocate for political initiatives he doesn’t like; he called for raising taxes to punish corporations that engage in political activities he doesn’t like; as a senator he sent a menacing letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding a federal investigation of a Washington Post writer who penned an op-ed he didn’t like; he expressed the hope that the U.S. would emulate Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s move to take government control of universities and purge them of teachers and ideas he doesn’t like. In 2021, Vance told a reporter for a Catholic magazine that he supports a ban on pornography, a proposal that’s also included in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 policy document. (Incidentally, Project 2025’s lead writer, Kevin Roberts, has a book coming out in September with a foreword written by Vance, making the Trump campaign’s feigned ignorance of Project 2025 even less plausible.) That’s about as “free speech for me, not thee” as it gets. When it comes to the GOP’s boss, Trump, free speech hypocrisy is one of the only consistent political principles he’s ever held. Just this week, he reiterated his long-held support for criminalizing flag burning. And he’s called for using the government to strip TV stations of their licenses for running content of which he disapproves; banning vaguely defined “woke ideologies” from classrooms; and has used his wealth to file an endless stream of bogus lawsuits against media outlets and journalists as a means of making their lives “miserable.” He’s also repeatedly called for lowering the bar for journalists to be sued for libel and defamation. While a president can’t do such a thing, a MAGA-dominated Supreme Court could by overturning the landmark Sullivan v. New York Times decision — something that Justice Clarence Thomas indicated he’s open to doing. Thomas called the 1964 decision and subsequent judicial affirmations of it “policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law” and having “no relation to the text, history or structure of the Constitution.” Now, to be sure, Democrats have not cloaked themselves in glory and honor when it comes to protecting Americans’ rights to free expression. Support for rigid, punitive and selectively enforced campus speech codes, poorly thought-out policy proposals to clamp down on free expression in the name of fighting disinformation and the government’s “jawboning” of private companies to intimidate them into policing certain speech … all that stuff’s really bad for freedom of speech. But it’s been a long time since Democrats writ large have made vocal and robust support for free speech a major part of their branding. It’s Republicans like Trump, Vance and allies like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who talk a big game about standing tall for free speech in the face of the tyranny of the “woke mind virus” — while also deciding that they should be the arbiters of acceptable speech, for the good of society. Don’t let them get away with calling themselves free speech warriors. They’d absolutely curb Americans’ rights if given the power. We know this because they’re saying it — right to our faces."
40,Trump wants to criminalize flag-burning. Here’s why that’s un-American.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 11:31:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-flag-burning-ban-palestine-protesters-rcna163736,"Images of protesters burning American flags are always divisive. But the scenes emerging from demonstrations in Washington during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress were especially so, given some protesters’ open support of Hamas. Equally predictable? The immediate calls to ban and punish flag burning that arose as criticism of the protests snowballed.  It is a question Americans continue to spar over, even though it is one the Supreme Court settled 35 years ago in Texas v. Johnson. In that case, the court affirmed that the government cannot punish offensive expression in service of protecting national symbols. Put simply, our anthem and our flag are not weighted more heavily than our rights.  But supporters of a ban got a boost from former President Donald Trump this week when, appearing on “Fox & Friends,” he advocated for congressional action and “a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American flag.” “Now, people will say, ‘Oh, it’s unconstitutional,’” the Republican presidential nominee added. “Those are stupid people that say that.”  Vice President Kamala Harris — the likely Democratic nominee — released a statement, as well. Unlike Trump, she did not call for a ban on flag burning, instead stating that the flag should “never be desecrated.” Let’s get a few things out of the way: Yes, you have the right to burn the American flag, but with some caveats.  You do not, of course, have the right to steal and vandalize a flag you do not own, and you may not be able to burn a flag in protest in any and all public spaces because of safety regulations. Police reportedly made arrests connected to protesters’ alleged theft and destruction of flags in the park outside Union Station, as well as other acts of vandalism. The conversations spurred by Trump and other advocates of a flag burning ban, however, extend far beyond criminal acts and well into purely expressive conduct. At its core, what’s at stake here is the right of people across the political spectrum to express deeply unpopular political views and be free of retaliation from the government they are criticizing.  Flag burners are rarely sympathetic free speech test cases for many Americans, but distaste for the incendiary way they express their opposition to the government should not lull us into accepting censorship rules that would be more at home in China or Russia than in a free country. Similar issues were recently raised in a court thousands of miles away that should illustrate to Americans the peril of allowing the government to erode the right to criticize or mock national symbols. In Hong Kong, the center of an ongoing crackdown on dissent, a man was found guilty last week of insulting China’s anthem after covering his ears while it played at a volleyball game.  That conviction should serve as a warning bell for Americans, not a playbook to follow.  Flag burning may be a deeply unpopular form of political expression, but it is nevertheless protected. That’s actually a sign of the wisdom of our First Amendment, not its stupidity. It suggests a confidence that critics of the U.S. and its symbols can be moved to change their minds through persuasion, a hallmark of a free and healthy society, rather than force.  Confining people to jail cells for burning the flag is far more likely to validate that they were right to oppose and mistrust the U.S. than to prove to them the sanctity of its symbols. “The way to preserve the flag’s special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters,” Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority of the Court in Texas v. Johnson. “It is to persuade them that they are wrong.”  His words are as true today as they were decades ago. Our speech rights may not be as tangible as a flag, but they are in far greater need of protection than our symbols. New flags can and will be sewn and raised, but a desecrated First Amendment would be much more difficult to repair."
41,"After the immunity ruling, Trump’s hush money case could come down to this",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 10:38:00,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-ruling-hush-money-case-new-york-rcna163781,"What effect does the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling have on Donald Trump’s New York criminal case? According to a new court filing from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, it has “no bearing on this prosecution.” That may turn out to be so. But let’s consider how the Roberts Court’s ruling, which came after the New York trial, could work mischief on the already secured guilty verdicts in the so-called hush money case. Recall that the high court’s Republican-appointed majority laid out a new, vague test for distinguishing between official acts that are (or can be) immune from prosecution, as opposed to unofficial acts that can be charged. That’s not the issue in this New York state case, where Trump wasn’t charged with official conduct. Rather, the issue stems from a strange part of the immunity ruling that curbs the government’s use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of private conduct. That raises the question of whether any such official evidence was improperly used to secure the Manhattan verdict — and what to do about it if so. First, what supposed official evidence from the trial are we talking about here? Prosecutors noted that Trump claimed six types: Prosecutors contend that the evidence didn’t run afoul of the immunity ruling and that “even if some of this evidence were improperly admitted, any error was harmless in light of other overwhelming evidence” of Trump’s guilt and shouldn’t lead to overturning the guilty verdict. Legal errors at criminal trials don’t automatically lead to reversal when there’s otherwise overwhelming evidence of guilt, and prosecutors say that’s the case here (while maintaining that there was no legal problem to begin with). Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyers argue that they should prevail in any harmless-error analysis but that such analysis can’t even apply here because, they say, presidential immunity errors are never harmless. In a normal case, the prosecution would be on solid footing. And it may yet prevail in defending the Trump verdict despite the immunity ruling. But we’re in a new world after that decision, one in which the Supreme Court majority’s guiding light can seemingly be boiled down to suspicion of prosecutions against former presidents — at least this former president. In their motion, which was made public Thursday, prosecutors wrote that none of the evidence that Trump objects to “said anything whatsoever about defendant’s presidential policies or political positions.” They further noted that the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, “not only allowed extensive individualized questioning during voir dire to ensure that the jurors were not politically biased, but also carefully instructed the jury not to let their personal or political opinions of defendant affect their consideration of the evidence.” That’s true. But in the immunity ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts was dismissive of the safeguards that are apparently sufficient to protect any other criminal defendant, writing that tools like evidentiary rulings and jury instructions “are unlikely to protect adequately the President’s constitutional prerogatives.” Again, perhaps the ruling has “no bearing” on this case, which has already gone to trial and wasn’t premised on Trump’s official conduct. It’s laughable to contemplate that the president’s constitutional prerogatives are at stake in the context of covering up a personal hush money scheme. But if it’s decided in retrospect that any official-type evidence improperly seeped into Trump’s trial, then prosecutors may be forced to try him all over again. Merchan is expected to rule Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects the defendant’s immunity motion. The judge already had a heavy task in weighing how to sentence the Republican presidential nominee. Now the immunity ruling has added another vague hurdle to get to that point.

42,Team Trump pushes back against FBI’s Wray on assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 10:07:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ronny-jackson-pushes-back-fbi-chris-wray-assassination-shooting-rcna163840,"FBI Director Chris Wray probably didn’t intend to spark a controversy during his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee this week, but the Trump-appointed official managed to make some unintended news anyway. The trouble began when Wray testified that there’s some uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Donald Trump’s injury from the recent assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” the FBI director told lawmakers. That might’ve reflected Wray’s genuine beliefs at this stage in the investigation, but the comments were not well received. Congressional Republicans spent much of yesterday expressing outrage about the testimony. Last night, the former president — who’d already called for Wray’s “immediate” resignation — published a furious, 144-word condemnation of the man he chose to lead the bureau. This morning, Team Trump went a little further, issuing another written statement from Rep. Ronny Jackson, addressed to “concerned citizens of the United States.” The right-wing Texas Republican, after reminding everyone that he’s Trump’s former White House physician, wrote: Jackson went on criticize Wray, saying that Congress should “correct the record” in the wake of his sworn testimony. Referencing the recent attempt on Trump’s life, the letter added, “There is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet.” The congressman’s statement has been promoted via social media by both the former president and his campaign team. For the record, I find it very easy to believe that Trump’s ear was, in fact, hit by a bullet. What’s more, I’m not altogether sure whether it matters: A gunman tried to kill an American presidential candidate. Whether the projectile that hit the Republican was a bullet or some kind of shrapnel, his life was clearly in great danger, and the incident deserves to be carefully scrutinized with the utmost seriousness. I also think it’s fair to say Team Trump hasn’t handled questions about what happened particularly well. As we’ve discussed, for the first several days after the shooting, the former president and his political operation had surprisingly little to say about the medical care he’d received. What’s more, it wasn’t at all clear why they were being so tight-lipped about this. An Associated Press report noted last week that the public was “still in the dark over the extent of his injuries, what treatment the Republican presidential nominee received in the hospital, and whether there may be any long-term effects on his health. Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family.” Eventually, Team Trump issued a statement from Jackson — a scandal-plagued former White House physician with serious credibility problems — instead of from one of the physicians who actually treated the former president after the incident. Now, they’re promoting another statement from Jackson, as part of an apparent effort to push back against Trump's handpicked FBI director. Again, something hit Trump’s ear. Based on everything we now know, I’m very much inclined to believe that it was a bullet. But what’s baffling is why the Republican and his operation are so resistant to transparency. Jackson’s latest statement said he’s reviewed the relevant medical records from Butler Memorial Hospital. Terrific. Why not show those same records to the public and put an end to the speculation? What’s more, why not make doctors who treated Trump available to journalists, instead of relying on a controversial member of Congress? This post updates our related earlier coverage."
43,A second Trump term would actively make climate change worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 09:09:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-climate-change-project-2025-proposals-rcna163426,"The videos first started appearing a dozen years ago. Pickup truck drivers, mostly young men, would modify their diesel engines and then record themselves deliberately spreading air pollution. It was called ""rolling coal,"" and the idea was to spew dark clouds of exhaust at bicyclists, Prius and Tesla drivers and other cars as a protest of environmentalism. The trend appears to have peaked in 2014, thanks to new state laws and crackdowns on people selling vehicle modification kits and, presumably, finding better things to do with their time. But the impulse behind it lives on, even as the risks of climate change become ever more serious. The most recent example? Project 2025, a set of conservative proposals from the Heritage Foundation that outlines step-by-step plans to remake the federal government in a second Donald Trump administration, including dismantling nearly everything the federal government is doing to fight climate change, making it dramatically harder to conduct basic scientific research on it and actively promoting more oil and gas use. Trump has tried to distance himself from the proposals, despite the fact that some of his top former advisers spearheaded it. But it's in line with his thinking. As The Washington Post reported, he told a gathering of top oil executives this year that he would reverse dozens of environmental regulations and stop new ones if they raised $1 billion to help him return to the White House. His campaign, meantime, targeted environmental regulations such as electric vehicle mandates in its Agenda 47, a scattershot series of videos outlining its plans for a second term. And at rallies, Trump frequently criticizes electric cars, claiming in one bizarre aside that buying one made his friend gain weight because he would eat at restaurants while it charged. Trump has also gone off on weird tangents about the risks of electric batteries on boats. In his first ""rolling coal"" term, Trump rolled back or loosened nearly 100 rules and regulations on pollution, many of which set the U.S. further behind in the effort to stop the worst effects of climate change, according to a tally by The New York Times. But that record would be dwarfed by the damage that the Project 2025 proposals could do if he followed through on them, even as Monday was the hottest day ever measured by humans, according to a European Union science agency. The 922-page document drips with disdain for what it calls ""climate alarmism"" that it argues is being used as propaganda for ""ineffective, liberty-crushing regulations."" But its most damaging proposal looks like it would launch what amounts to a propaganda effort against climate science. The first step is something called Schedule F, which would reclassify thousands of government workers, making it easier for the president to hire and fire them. Even if Trump were to fire only some of those workers, the shift toward politicization of lower-level government jobs would mean an exodus of experienced scientists. Those who remained might become more cautious about their research decisions to avoid trouble. The second step is to create a job that appears to basically be an anti-climate change czar. Project 2025 proposes creating a position of ""science adviser"" and six senior political appointees who would be charged with ""overseeing and reforming"" research at the Environmental Protection Agency, emphasizing that these political overseers should be hired for their ""management, oversight and execution skills,"" rather than scientific expertise. Imagine something like the final scene of an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" only with Trump hauling climate scientists into the boardroom to dramatically fire them. That may be exciting for the oil and gas industry and some of Trump's supporters but not for the two-thirds of Americans in a recent Pew Research Center survey who said they support the country's taking steps to become carbon neutral by 2050. (If you want to understand the depth of disdain here, the section on the EPA was written by Mandy Gunasekara. The Drilled newsletter points out she's in the famous 2015 photo of her then-boss, the late Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., holding up a snowball in the Senate as an attempt to disprove climate change.) The report goes further, proposing dramatically downsizing the National Weather Service and leaving weather forecasting to private companies. That could hamper its ability to issue public warnings about floods, hurricanes and other dangers, just as we are seeing more intense and frequent extreme-weather events due to the human-caused increase in greenhouse gases. That's not all. Other sections of Project 2025 propose ending subsidies for wind and solar power; cutting research into wind, solar and battery technology needed to help transition away from fossil fuels; ending federal mandates and subsidies for electric vehicles; and expanding drilling for oil and natural gas on federal lands. As Trump said in his convention speech, ""we will drill, baby, drill."" The efforts would not be limited to the U.S., either. A section on foreign aid proposes rolling back efforts to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuels, arguing that they are ""unachievable."" But then it goes further, arguing that the U.S. should spend taxpayer dollars persuading these countries to burn more oil and gas. The U.S. Agency for International Development, the proposal says, ""should cease its war on fossil fuels in the developing world and support the responsible management of oil and gas reserves as the quickest way to end wrenching poverty."" Taken together, these proposals would not just make it harder to fight climate change but actively make it worse. A second Trump administration would be rolling coal on the entire planet."
44,"Why in the world does Trump keep saying, ‘We don’t need the votes’?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 07:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-keep-saying-dont-need-votes-election-2024-rcna163808,"You don’t need to be an expert in electoral politics to understand Rule One of any campaign: Candidates should pursue as many votes as possible. In a democracy, it’s common sense: The more votes a campaign has, the greater the chance of success. With this in mind, Donald Trump appears to have a counterintuitive rhetorical habit. The New Republic noted: As a clip from the show makes clear, the former president didn’t appear to be kidding. If the phrasing sounded at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. The day after last month’s presidential debate, for example, Trump held a rally in Virginia and told attendees, “We don’t need votes.” A week earlier, the Republican spoke at a far-right conference and said roughly the same thing. “I tell my people, I don’t need any votes,” said Trump, who added: “We don’t need the votes.” That came on heels of the GOP candidate pushing the same line during an appearance in Detroit. “Listen, we don’t need votes,” Trump said. He added: “We don’t need votes. We have to stop — focus, don’t worry about votes.” In fact, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the former president has been pushing this line since last fall, during his party’s primary process. “You don’t have to vote,” Trump told a New Hampshire audience in October. “Don’t worry about voting. The voting — we got plenty of votes.” At face value, all of this probably seems bizarre. In fact, I’ve never heard a candidate for elected office — in any race, in either party, in any cycle — literally tell the public, “Don’t worry about voting.” But making matters worse is the message behind the message. Despite the odd phrasing, Trump isn’t literally telling Americans not to cast ballots, he’s instead arguing that he’s so wildly popular, receiving support from voters will be effortless as Election Day nears. The real challenge, the former president invariably adds, is dealing with cheating and electoral fraud that definitely exist in his weird imagination, despite Trump’s inability to substantiate his conspiracy theories with evidence. In other words, every time the Republican downplays the need for votes, he’s necessarily emphasizing the need for unnecessary voter intimidation tactics."
45,Harris mocks Trump after he hedges (again) on presidential debate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 05:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-mocks-donald-trump-election-presidential-debate-2024-rcna163777,"The first sign of trouble came on Sunday. Just a few hours after President Joe Biden announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term, Donald Trump quickly turned his attention to one thing: an upcoming presidential debate, which he suddenly seemed reluctant to attend. The Republican published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC in early September, and though Trump and his campaign operation had already agreed to participate in the event, the former president declared on Sunday that he instead wanted a debate on Fox News, instead of a network he described as “fake.” The second sign of trouble came two days later, when the GOP nominee doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later Tuesday, Trump told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate the likely Democratic nominee, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden.” The latest sign of trouble came last night. The New York Times reported: The written statement from Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign’s communications director, was weird, even by 2024 standards. It said there’s “chaos” in Democratic politics (there’s not). It said Biden is corrupt (he isn’t). It suggested Barack Obama opposes Harris (he doesn’t). It suggested it was necessary to use Obama’s middle name (it’s not). It said the opposing party is called the ""Democrat Party"" (it's not). It also said “many” Democrats want to nominate someone other than Harris (they don’t). But after combing through the nonsense, the bottom line was simple: Team Trump concluded that it would be “inappropriate” to “finalize” the existing debate schedule until after the Democratic National Convention. It led the Democratic vice president to respond with a simple and derisive message via social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” It came hours after Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’s only been a candidate for less than a week, and she didn't know why her rival was ""back-pedaling."" Harris’ mockery was rooted in fact. Trump spent the better part of a year begging for debates against Biden, and expressed total indifference to the details. The former president summarized his position in three words: “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” When Biden proposed a pre-convention debate, Trump was only too pleased to agree. The Republican’s position is obviously vastly different now. When we last kicked this around, it seemed as if there were a couple of possible explanations for the antics. One was that Trump was engaged in a mind-numbing “work the refs” exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff. The other possibility is that Trump and his team are simply afraid of how he’d perform against the incumbent vice president. All things considered, the latter explanation appears to be the accurate one. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
