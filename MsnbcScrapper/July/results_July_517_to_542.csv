"Texas’ Lloyd Doggett breaks new ground, urges Biden to withdraw",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-lloyd-doggett-breaks-new-ground-urges-biden-withdraw-rcna160002,"In the days following last week’s debate, President Joe Biden heard from a great many media figures calling him to abandon his re-election plans, but those weren’t the voices the Democratic incumbent was concerned about. There are also prominent party donors looking for alternatives, but they're not Biden's principal concern, either. Of far greater interest were the party’s elected officials. The Washington Post reported this week that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries “told his worried members to hold their fire for a few days to see how things shake out,” and for a while, they did exactly that. In fact, in the four days following the debate, the grand total of Democratic officials — in the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and gubernatorial offices nationwide — who publicly called on Biden to pass the torch was zero. Now, that number is one: Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, a veteran lawmaker first elected 30 years ago, issued a written statement today asking the president to stand down. The Texas Tribune reported on the congressman's unexpected written statement: “I represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson. Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw. President Biden should do the same,” Doggett continued. The statement went on to argue, ""President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024."" A spokesperson for the president's re-election campaign responded to the news by saying that Biden is ""staying in,"" and noting the supportive comments he's received from other congressional Democrats. And while that's true, those who watch Capitol Hill closely know that members are often reluctant to be the first to take a provocative position. What we don't yet know is whether Doggett will be an isolated voice, or whether he just opened a door others will soon walk through. Complicating matters, while Doggett is the first to take this bold step, it's probably fair to say that the party over the last 48 hours hasn't exactly shown the White House an unyielding and unbreakable wall of solid support. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, for example, appeared on MSNBC earlier today and said, “I think it’s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?"" Also today, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime Biden ally and former member of the House leadership, said during an MSNBC interview that Democrats should support Vice President Kamala Harris, ""whether she’s in second place or at the top of the ticket.” Yesterday, Andy Beshear, Kentucky's governor and a Democrat who's rumored to have national ambitions, also hedged on Biden's future, while Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said he was surprised and “pretty horrified” by the president's appearance at last week's debate. A day earlier, Rep. Jamie Raskin also appeared open to a change on his party's ticket. “We’re having a serious conversation about what to do,” the Maryland Democrat told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi. Raskin, an influential voice in Democratic politics, added, “One thing I can tell you is that regardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified. ... Whether he’s the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention. He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward and beat the forces of authoritarianism and reaction in the country.” The on-air comments, at a minimum, suggested that Raskin sees Biden's future as unresolved. Doggett's statement serves as a reminder that others in the party have arrived at the same conclusion."

Rudy Giuliani officially disbarred in New York,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 9:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-new-york-election-2020-rcna159984,"Rudy Giuliani, the former prosecutor, New York mayor and lawyer for Donald Trump, has been disbarred from practicing law in New York over bigoted lies claiming that election fraud denied Trump a rightful victory in 2020.  The decision was made by the New York appeals court in Manhattan. According to the filing, the court determined Giuliani knowingly lied about the election, including claims about illegal voters being bused from out of state to vote in Pennsylvania’s election, and that a vote was cast by deceased boxer Joe Frazier. The filing also determined that Giuliani pushed a raft of other baseless claims — like his allegation that thousands of noncitizens cast ballots in Arizona — that lacked reputable evidence.  The court said Giuliani must “comply with the rules governing the conduct of disbarred or suspended attorneys.” It certainly marks a fall from grace for a man who was once billed as ""America's mayor."" Giuliani’s troubles don’t end there. He's also been recommended for disbarment in Washington, D.C.; he’s still facing a RICO indictment in Georgia and another election-related indictment in Arizona; and he’s filed for bankruptcy to liquidate his assets in order to pay nearly $150 million defamation judgments to creditors for false claims he made about Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, among others."

Gretchen Whitmer called a senior official with President Biden’s campaign on Friday night, and conveyed a clear message: The Democratic governor “hated the way her name was being floated as a replacement for Biden and she wasn’t behind the chatter.” * Speaking of Whitmer, there were reports that the governor told Team Biden that the incumbent president probably won’t win Michigan in the fall, but she pushed back against such talk yesterday. “I am proud to support Joe Biden as our nominee and I am behind him 100 percent in the fight to defeat Donald Trump,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Not only do I believe Joe can win Michigan, I know he can because he’s got the receipts: he’s lowered health care costs, brought back manufacturing jobs, and is committed to restoring the reproductive freedom women lost under Donald Trump.” * And speaking of Michigan, the latest EPIC-MRA poll found Donald Trump leading Biden by four points in the Wolverine State — three points with third-party candidates in the mix — in a survey that was conducted before last week’s presidential debate. * It was of interest to see reports that Biden has used teleprompters during some recent fundraising events. That’s not common among presidents and/or presidential candidates. * The incumbent president’s political operation announced that it raised $264 million in the second quarter of 2024 — including $127 million in June, which proved to be the Democratic campaign’s best month of the cycle. * A group of prominent conservative Trump critics agreed to meet with senior Biden campaign officials yesterday. Participants in the event — which was scheduled before last week’s debate — have been tight-lipped about how the discussion went. * And in Georgia, which Biden narrowly carried in 2020, the latest Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll showed Trump ahead, 43% to 38%.

Biden calls Supreme Court's Trump immunity ruling 'a terrible disservice' to the nation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 8:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-trump-immunity-supreme-court-rcna159933,"President Joe Biden on Monday sharply rebuked the Supreme Court's ruling on Donald Trump's presidential immunity claim, in remarks that departed from his relative silence on his election rival’s ongoing criminal cases. In a brief speech delivered from the White House, Biden said the court has done “a terrible disservice to the people of this nation” with its ruling that grants Trump some immunity from prosecution in his federal election interference case. “No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,” Biden said. “With today’s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed. For all — for all practical purposes, today’s decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what the president can do.” He called the Monday ruling a continuation of the Supreme Court’s assault “on a wide range of long-established legal principles in our nation,” including on voting rights and abortion rights. Biden framed the decision as one that increases the high stakes of this election. “The American people must decide if they want to entrust the president — once again, the presidency — to Donald Trump now, knowing he’ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants to do it,” he said. Biden’s brief remarks come as he faces intense pressure from some Democratic donors, strategists and lawmakers to step down after last week’s disastrous debate performance. The president has largely steered clear of commenting on Trump’s criminal indictments — though he has called Trump a “convicted felon” after the presumptive GOP nominee’s conviction in New York in May. Still, Trump attacked his Democratic rival in a series of Truth Social posts on Monday night, claiming that Biden's speech was an attempt to “deflect from his horrible campaign performance.”"
Why John Kelly remains one of Trump’s favorite political targets,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 8:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/john-kelly-remains-one-trumps-favorite-political-targets-rcna159962,"It was late last year when The Washington Post reported that Donald Trump had created an enemies list of sorts, with the hope that the Justice Department would investigate his targets if voters give him a second term. The list wasn’t exactly short, though one name stood out: former White House chief of staff John Kelly. In other words, the former president, eying a return to the Oval Office, wants to use the levers of federal power to go after his own former right-hand man — who also happens to be Trump’s former handpicked Homeland Security secretary and a retired four-star Marine general. But it appears the Republican isn’t prepared to wait until 2025 to go after Kelly rhetorically. Late last week, at his first post-debate rally, Trump told his followers: The crowd responded with predictable booing. This wasn’t the first time. Last October, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” But why is the presumptive GOP nominee still bringing up the retired general, unprompted? It might have something to do with the fact that Trump appears preoccupied with allegations that he denigrated American servicemembers as “suckers and losers” — a contentious point during last week’s debate — and Kelly is the one who’s confirmed that Trump really did use the ugly language. In fact, Trump’s longest-serving White House chief of staff confirmed the story with on-the-record comments to CNN last year. “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly said in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of, among other things, “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues,” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. Trump continues to push back, though the fact that he’s publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign."
Trump-appointed judge undermines Biden’s climate agenda (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 7:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-judge-undermines-bidens-climate-agenda-rcna159944,"After the Biden administration took steps to raise the cost estimate of carbon emissions, Republican attorneys general filed suit and took their case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. There, they found Judge James Cain, tapped for the federal bench by Donald Trump, who predictably ruled in 2022 against the Democratic White House and its climate agenda. A year later, the same Louisiana judge sided with oil companies in a closely watched case related offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, Cain is again making headlines — and for similar reasons. The Washington Post reported that the conservative jurist blocked President Joe Biden’s pause on approving new facilities that export liquefied natural gas, “dealing another legal blow to the president’s ambitious climate agenda.” I’ll leave it to others to determine whether the conservative judge meant “epiphany” or “epitome.” Similarly, it’s not altogether clear in context whether Cain intended to use the word “ideocracy” — given its meaning, this seemed like a curious choice of words — or if he was trying to reference “Idiocracy.” Either way, there’s a larger pattern that’s worth appreciating: Biden has had some important and impressive successes on combatting the climate crisis, but Republican-appointed judges haven’t exactly made his job easier. On the contrary, Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices in 2022 curbed the Environmental Protection Agency’s options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, and as the Post’s report added, those same far-right jurists issued a pair of decisions last week “that sharply curtailed the power of federal agencies to address climate change, air pollution and other pressing environmental problems.” Earlier this year, meanwhile, U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of Texas, another Trump appointee, struck down a Biden administration climate policy that required states “to measure and set declining targets for greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles using the national highway system.” The New York Times reported two years ago on “a coordinated, multiyear strategy by Republican attorneys general, conservative legal activists and their funders, several with ties to the oil and coal industries, to use the judicial system to rewrite environmental law, weakening the executive branch’s ability to tackle global warming.” The article added, “Coming up through the federal courts are more climate cases, some featuring novel legal arguments, each carefully selected for its potential to block the government’s ability to regulate industries and businesses that produce greenhouse gases.” Those plans appear to be advancing apace, which is great news for the oil and coal industries, and bad news for life on Earth."
"Post-debate polls offer a mixed bag for Biden, Trump in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 6:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/post-debate-polls-offer-mixed-bag-biden-trump-2024-race-rcna159925,"Over the last half-century, first-term presidents seeking re-election nearly always flub their first debate. Ronald Reagan looked and sounded awful against Walter Mondale in 1984; George W. Bush was easily defeated by John Kerry in 2004; and Barack Obama struggled badly against Mitt Romney in 2012. When Democrats respond to last week’s developments by pointing to this recent history, they have a point. The difference is, Reagan, Bush and Obama were ahead at the time. When debate viewers tuned in and saw them stumble, the incumbents enjoyed a buffer of support that helped prevent panic among their respective parties and supporters. With President Joe Biden, it’s a bit more complicated. Ahead of last week’s debate, the Democratic incumbent was already trailing in most national and battleground state polling. What’s more, pre-debate surveys found that nearly seven in 10 Americans saw Biden as too old to effectively lead. The buffer the president’s modern predecessors enjoyed didn’t exist ahead of last week’s showdown. Indeed, it’s one of the reasons Biden and his team scheduled the debate in the first place: They thought it might help push the 2024 race in a new direction. Obviously, the Democrat’s performance in Atlanta didn’t go as planned, and as a result, there’s been intense interest in what the next round of polling would say. It’s against this backdrop that USA Today reported: Note, this national survey was conducted entirely after last week’s Biden/Trump debate. The poll’s results are not enough to send shockwaves through Democratic politics — if the same data showed the presumptive GOP nominee ahead by double digits, today would be a very different kind of day — though they are enough to keep the fire of anxiety alive among Biden’s backers. Similarly for Trump, the former president will be pleased to see himself ahead, but if he thought the debate would put him in a dominant position, the poll suggests that hasn't happened, at least not yet. Though the next big round of data hasn’t yet arrived, the USA Today/Suffolk poll wasn’t the only survey of note. In New Hampshire, for example, a St. Anselm College poll conducted a post-debate poll and found Trump leading Biden in the Granite State by a couple of points — which wouldn’t be that bad for Democrats except Biden won New Hampshire by seven points in the last election, and late last year, a St. Anselm College poll found Biden up by 10 points in the state. I continue to believe the polls will have an enormous impact on whether Democratic officials try to shake up their 2024 ticket. For now, the fact that the data isn’t showing an epic collapse for the incumbent should probably be seen as a good sign at Biden HQ, though the longer the polls show him trailing his felonious rival, the more the chatter will endure about the president passing the torch."
"AOC, fellow Dems explore recourses following Supreme Court ruling",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/aoc-fellow-dems-explore-recourses-supreme-court-ruling-rcna159919,"For as long as there have been Supreme Court rulings, there have been members of Congress dissatisfied with the justices’ opinions. Historically, this tends to lead to complaints and concerns, but little in the way of actual legislative actions. That said, for determined lawmakers, it would be an overstatement to argue that members have literally no options when sitting justices on the high court go too far. For example, as part of the Madisonian model of checks and balances, members of Congress have impeachment authority — and as The New Republic noted, one high-profile Democrat is eager to exercise that authority. The New York Democrat didn’t specify which justices she intends to target with articles of impeachment, though the congresswoman — who’s sometimes known by her “AOC” initials — did say in an online statement, “The Supreme Court has become consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control. Today’s ruling represents an assault on American democracy. It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture.” Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t alone in seeking legislative remedies. Rep. Joe Morelle, another New York Democrat, responded to the Trump v. U.S. ruling by vowing to introduce a constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Court’s “harmful immunity decision and ensure that no president is above the law.” Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, meanwhile, issued a written statement that read in part, “We must take all available measures to reign in the increasingly unfettered power of this radical court, including a binding code of ethics and expanding the number of justices. Six people who were never elected cannot be allowed to continue destroying our democracy.” There are a couple of ways to assess efforts like these. The first is on the merits, and on that front, it’s easy to be sympathetic to the Democratic proposals. The Supreme Court’s radicalized Republican majority has taken indefensible steps in recent years, but to elevate the presidency above the law is a uniquely pernicious act. The second, however, is more pragmatic. No sitting justice has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process, and the last time such a case even went to the Senate was 220 years ago. Relatedly, the Constitution has never been amended to reverse a misguided Supreme Court decision; and while Congress has expanded the Supreme Court before, it’s been 155 years, and the odds of such an effort clearing Capitol Hill anytime soon are extraordinarily remote. Or put another way, the Democratic responses to Trump v. U.S. might make sense, but those hoping to see such measures advance should lower their expectations. But if Congress can’t fix what Republican justices have broken, what is the remedy? There is “very little we can do except elect a Democrat [as president] who will appoint vacancies if Democrats hold [the] Senate,” Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee told Axios. In other words, those looking for a recourse shouldn’t look to Congress, they should look to voters, who now have an added reason to choose wisely."
Trump amplifies radical retaliatory message targeting Liz Cheney,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-amplifies-radical-retaliatory-message-targeting-liz-cheney-rcna159915,"The question of whether Donald Trump would try to prosecute his perceived political enemies in a second term has already been answered. As we’ve discussed, the former president has not only publicly acknowledged his intentions in multiple interviews, he’s also trailed by a record of already having made such attempts. What this realization leads to is related questions about which foes he’ll target, and how he intends to go after them. It’s against this backdrop that The New York Times reported: Of particular interest was a message that the former president amplified, which asserted that former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney is “guilty of treason.” The message — which someone else created, but which Trump promoted — encouraged other users of Trump’s social media platform to help get the word out “if you want televised military tribunals.” As the Times’ report added, military tribunals are a type of military court “reserved for enemy combatants and war criminals.” The presumptive GOP nominee’s political operation had an opportunity to clarify matters, and perhaps even walk the messages back. Instead, a Trump campaign spokesperson told the Times, “Liz Cheney and the sham January 6th committee banned key witnesses, shielded important evidence, and destroyed documents.” Or put another way, asked why the former president amplified a message that accused the former House GOP Conference chair of “treason,” Team Trump doubled down on its condemnation of the former congresswoman. There’s no shortage of problems here. First, in reality, the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee wasn’t a “sham”; it didn’t ban witnesses; it didn’t block evidence; and it didn’t destroy evidence. Second, the idea that Trump might prefer “military tribunals” for his political critics is every bit as unsettling as it seems. And third, it’s never been altogether clear whether Trump knows what “treason” means, though there’s little doubt that he loves to casually throw the word around — far more than he should. The former president has accused Barack Obama of treason. And Nancy Pelosi. And James Comey. He’s also eyed treason investigations into Adam Schiff, The New York Times, Google, and federal law enforcement officials. At one point, after one of his State of the Union addresses, Trump even suggested that congressional Democrats might have committed “treason” because they failed to applaud to his satisfaction. As the Republican eyes a second term, his “treason” list continues to grow. This can, and likely will, get ugly in a hurry. Axios reported overnight that Trump, if rewarded with a second term, “plans to immediately test the boundaries of presidential and governing power.” The article went on to note that the Republican “promises an unabashedly imperial presidency — one that would turn the Justice Department against critics.” What's more, all of this comes against a backdrop of a Supreme Court ruling that told Trump that the American presidency is effectively above the law. To not be concerned is to close one’s eyes."
The Supreme Court wrote an immunity test Trump can't help but pass,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-test-rcna159784,"It’s hard to see how the Supreme Court’s ruling on whether former President Donald Trump enjoys immunity from prosecution could be much worse. It’s true that the opinion in Trump v. United States doesn’t grant him the absolute immunity that he’d claimed. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts authored a majority opinion as close as possible to finding that absolute immunity without making a complete mockery of the findings of the lower courts. In the end, the chief justice and his GOP-appointed colleagues determined that presidents are immune for “official acts” but may still be prosecuted for “unofficial acts” once they’ve left office. With this decision, the six conservative justices left up in the air exactly what parts of the federal indictment against Trump are still constitutional. The opinion accordingly pats itself on the back for not making the determination straight away, leaving that to the lower courts to determine based on a test of the Supreme Court’s devising. But the caveats and examples that the court provides in its opinion makes it obvious that anything determined to be outside the shield it has erected around Trump will be at best a temporary setback for the former president. In this brave new world, a president’s actions can be divided into three categories. The first are those official acts that are “conclusive and preclusive” — authorized through a power granted solely to the president under the Constitution. Such acts are now totally protected from prosecution. All other official acts, including presidential communications, are granted “presumptive immunity.” In those cases, prosecutors can still argue that executive privilege doesn’t apply but it’s up to a judge to make that call. Finally, “unofficial acts,” or those taken beyond the scope of office, don’t fall under the aegis of this newfound immunity — but exactly what counts is left undefined. In setting this new precedent, Roberts draws heavily on the 1982 decision in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, which determined that the president enjoys immunity from civil cases even for acts that extend to the “outer perimeter” of their role. The same presumed immunity for those acts now applies to criminal cases, “so long as they are ‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.’” With that very unhelpful guidance, Roberts has ordered the lower courts to do the work now of figuring out what exactly that entails, including whether the Trump-led pressure campaign against former Vice President Mike Pence fits the bill. Accordingly, this ruling has wiped away entirely the assertion in special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment that Trump leaned on the Justice Department to pursue false election fraud cases to bolster his efforts to overturn the election. More damaging, Smith is now blocked from even using those supposedly “official acts” as evidence to prove criminality for unofficial acts, whichever those wind up being. The overall effect is to tie prosecutors’ hands, cutting them off from one of the key factors in determining whether to bring charges against a person. Importantly, Roberts also writes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” This new dictum applies even in instances of clear motive to act in their own personal interest, rather the national interest, putting such motivations beyond the reach of prosecutors. This determination also all but bars lower court judges from applying common sense to charges involving a president, as Monday’s ruling also blocks judges from deeming a president’s action unofficial “merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.” To top it all off, Roberts sanctimoniously forgoes driving the dagger into the heart of this case. After determining that criminal immunity exists for official presidential actions, he then writes that “the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute” for each of those given actions. No, those issues must be left for the future because, he writes, a single case “in more than ‘two centuries does not afford enough experience’ to definitively and comprehensively determine the President’s scope of immunity from criminal prosecution.” U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the federal case in question, is now tasked with adjudicating which of Trump’s actions are still subject to prosecution. What is left only implicit in the opinion, though, is that those decisions are subject to appeal by Trump or the prosecutors (though much more likely the former). So, too, are the decisions that the appeals court eventually makes, putting the final call right back where it started: in the hands of Roberts and his fellow conservatives. In sum, this decision is a Roberts special, projecting neutral impartiality while thoroughly skewed toward a predetermined outcome. The supposed tests that are meant to give the veneer of wide applicability beyond Trump should instead be seen in the same light as the decision to allow him onto the ballot despite the 14th Amendment’s language preventing it: a fig leaf over a standard that applies to only one man. It frankly would have been better if Roberts had adopted Justice Samuel Alito’s disdain for subtlety. It would be more honest for Roberts to not bother pretending that the court’s conservative wing won't eventually consider Trump’s attempts to steal the 2020 election entirely within the bounds of this newly created immunity. Instead, we are forced to watch as Trump, newly armed with the confidence that nothing can stop him, continues throwing rocks into the gears of justice, grinding proceedings against him to a halt once more."
The Immunity Decision,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-immunity-decision-rcna159868,"The consequential question before the Supreme Court on the limit and scope of presidential immunity has been decided, in three essential buckets. Veteran prosecutors Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord decipher the ramifications for the former president, for the January 6th case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, and for the broad constitutional authority of the presidency itself. And they are joined by Trevor Morrison, NYU law professor and Dean Emeritus, to discern the finer points of the decision and the warnings cast in dissents by both Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hello and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Monday, July 1st, the last day of the Supreme Court term, and I’m Andrew Weissman. I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Hey, Andrew. I was about to say good morning, but it’s not morning anymore. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, it’s 1:05. The two of us have been speed reading this morning because, as anyone who is listening to this knows, the Supreme Court has issued its decision in the presidential immunity case, and that is something we’re going to spend a whole episode talking about, going through the decision, the majority, the dissents. We also have a guest, somebody who people may remember. He is an expert on presidential immunity, Trevor Morrison. But first, Mary and I are going to talk about that decision. So, Mary, I’m going to turn it to you because this is one doozy of a decision. How do you want to start us off? Mary McCord: Yeah, I mean, you know, we could go through, you know, what the majority held, or we could have some observations, which is what I’m going to do, about sort of a open question, I think, in my mind about how narrow or how broad this ruling is, because the chief justice who wrote for the majority wants to try to tamp down any fear-mongering that this is really the end of democracy because it’s elevating presidents above the law.   And the dissent, to the contrast, are saying, oh, no, no, no, this is exceedingly broad. And it basically gives, I mean, Justice Sotomayor and also Justice Jackson, in a separate dissent, both go back to the examples that Florence Pan, a judge on the D.C. Circuit, raised with Mr. Trump’s attorney during oral argument on this case in the D.C. Circuit. Could a president order SEAL Team Six to assassinate his political opponent? And their fear is the answer, given the majority’s opinion, is yes. Andrew Weissmann: So why don’t we start with how do you read the holding here, the actual holding, and then we can talk a little bit more about where it might go. And then also, one way to think about this is big picture, what is it saying about the presidency? And the smaller picture is what does it say about this case? Like, where does it leave this case, the January 6 case? But why don’t we start with the bigger picture? Because in many ways, you know, that’s the thing that’s maybe more important to our country. And then we can sort of take it in like an onion and peel back the layers. Mary McCord: Yeah, well, that’s interesting, right? Because after we talked about the argument, one of the things I think you and I sort of criticized some of the justices for is making this a case for the ages, right? Where some of the justices indicated that they needed, you know, this lay down the law for the future. And certainly, Jack Smith and the government had argued, and I think you and I generally agreed with this point, but correct me if I’m wrong, that, you know, you actually don’t have to decide every possible permutation of when a president might be immune because the allegations in this case are what are in front of you and this doesn’t have to be a case for the ages. It’s never come up before. There’s no real reason it would come up again. But as you said, the majority’s approach was very much this is establishing sort of a rule for the ages. And just in terms of the basics, which listeners have probably heard by the time this podcast airs, you know, the three buckets of things the Supreme Court majority discussed were absolute immunity for acts that are within the president’s core constitutionally committed duties and responsibilities. Thing one, we’ll come back to that. Thing two, for other things that are within the outer perimeter of a president’s official acts, there would be at least presumptive immunity.   But that could be rebutted by the government upon a showing that prosecution, even for those things within the outer perimeter of official acts, would not impair or impede the executive functions, the power of the executive to do what he has a responsibility to do. We’ll come back to what that means. And then finally, unofficial acts, no immunity. So how this all works together, I think, is where the rubber meets the road in terms of applying it to this case and in any future case. Andrew Weissmann: Can I give a slightly different read that I definitely have the three-bucket view, but -- Mary McCord: But how you apply it involves far more questions than three. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And I think my concern about the middle bucket is that I think what the court is saying is that if it is ultimately determined that the conduct at issue is official conduct, it is immune. And so if you’ve got official conduct, it’s immune. If you’ve got unofficial conduct, it’s not immune. So, you know, personal conduct. So that’s really borrowing from the civil standard of presidential immunity. The reason I think they can focus on this issue of absolute immunity is they say, look, if its core functioning of like something that’s been exclusively delegated to the presidency, you don’t even have to sort of get into it. There’s not a lot of fact finding. So they actually give an example of that, which is the president’s communications with the attorney general, they say, is core and absolutely immune.   And that means all the allegations about Donald Trump’s communications with the Department of Justice, even though, by the way, they’re not with the attorney general himself.  They were actually with other people who were wanting to be the attorney general, but they basically seem to be kicking that out as part of saying absolutely immune and then they say -- Mary McCord: Hang on. I wouldn’t say basically or an example. I think they rule that is off limits. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You’re right. You’re right. Oh, yes. Mary McCord: That’s an official act. That’s off limits. No prosecution for that. Andrew Weissmann: Sorry. I shouldn’t have said basically. You’re absolutely right. And we can come back to that because that has such incredible, dire consequences when you’re dealing with Donald Trump talking about weaponizing the Department of Justice. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And you now have the Supreme Court saying, oh, yeah -- Mary McCord: They are new. Andrew Weissmann: -- there are certain core functions. Those are absolutely immune. I mean, that to me is just beyond shocking in terms of what they’re doing. You don’t need to worry about, oh, hypotheticals. And Chief Justice Roberts denigrates the hypotheticals that Justices Sotomayor and Jackson give. But these aren’t hypotheticals. You’ve got a former president and a person running for office saying this is what he wants to do and he’s -- Mary McCord: But before we move to the next bucket, if that’s what you were going to do -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- I do want to also mention that in this idea, this idea of what’s core constitutionally committed to the president, core constitutional functions, that wouldn’t include, I don’t think, in any typical reading of the Constitution, talking to your attorney general. Because what I think most of us think of when we think about constitutionally committed presidential functions, it’s things that are explicit in the Constitution. Things, for example, that Jack Smith argued were core constitutional functions, the pardon power, the power to appoint ambassadors, the power to recognize foreign governments. Those are the kind of things. Instead, the majority expands core to, well, the president has the power under the Take Care Clause to see that the laws be faithfully executed. Within that means, as part of the executive branch, he has discretion over what the Department of Justice investigates and what it does, and that’s part of his Take Care Clause functions. Therefore, that’s core. That is a very expansive reading of core. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. This is why it’s great doing this with you, because that was going to be my second point, plus you said it so much better than I would have, which is that we all thought, and I know Trevor had talked about this core piece being something that would be absolutely immune, but we didn’t think core was going to be expanded to be like Take Care Clause. If it’s Take Care Clause, I mean, that is so malleable. But anyway, so then you’ve got this second bucket, and the second bucket is where I do see what I’ll say is a slight silver lining in connection with -- Mary McCord: Same. Andrew Weissmann: -- this case -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- but a terrible precedent big picture. Mary McCord:  Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And the reason it’s a terrible precedent big picture is that the court goes out of its way to say there’s this presumption that what the president does is in his official capacity, and that it says, you know, even if you’re talking to state officials, that could be within your official capacity. Even if you’re tweeting, it just gives tons and tons of examples of why you would be able to view something as part of your official functions, and super expansive. And the only example they really give of something that might be unofficial is when they say, essentially, it says, perhaps as a candidate. Mary McCord: Right.  Andrew Weissmann: And so that very much goes back to something that Judge Pryor on the 11th Circuit focused on when he was dealing with Mark Meadows. And Mark Meadows said, I was doing all of my outreach to Georgia as part of my official functioning as chief of staff. And Judge Pryor said, no, you’re not, because there’s no function there. And that’s -- Mary McCord: And by that, just to take your no function, meaning there’s no federal government authority to direct how states send forth electoral ballots or choose their electors. And so he was looking at what I think is a logical legal way to analyze this, is something within the federal government or the executive branch authority. And if it’s not, because the Constitution commits to the states how to decide on who their electors will be for president, then you can’t say it’s official acts. But as you just were saying, this goes beyond that. Well, you know, he has a bully pulpit and he can certainly raise issues of election fraud with state officials. And so you have to parse it. Andrew Weissmann: Right. They basically say just because he has no role doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have an interest in talking about it to the public. I mean, it is the most expansive view, but they do say that it’s very fact intensive. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: There isn’t a factual record here. And so they do send it back to Judge Chutkan to have a factual hearing. And that means that she will be able, after briefing, which they also say is something that she needs to do, meaning slow, there needs to be briefing. And she, though, can have a factual hearing on this issue. And then finally, there is this third bucket, which is the personal, but as we’re talking about it, it’s really hard to imagine what personal is. Now, I would say the New York case where he is sending from the Oval Office signing checks in connection with a hush money scheme is going to be personal. They don’t say that. But I wanted to raise something that you noted, Mary, which is the dissents raise the Judge Pan issue of, can you order SEAL Team Six to kill somebody? And this would be, can you order the attorney general to prosecute somebody who’s a political rival? And what’s remarkable to me is the only response from the majority is to say those are fanciful.   Mary McCord: Yeah. Are they?   Andrew Weissmann: They don’t actually say -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- how will the test -- Mary McCord: Apply. Andrew Weissmann: -- deal with that. And the test, I hate to say this, because this is what’s so scary, outrageous. I know this has been a very difficult week. If you do not think that the Supreme Court is on the ballot, this decision, I think, leave aside the Trump trial, because I never thought that was going to go to trial before the election and this at least allows a hearing, which I also thought might be possible, but now we know is possible. But big picture, this fundamentally changes the role of the presidency in our democracy. We just had Chevron, which basically is a big blow to the administrative state, and clean water, health, clean air, basically the regulatory state, you know, from FDR on has a huge blow. But if you think that was a big blow, this to me means it is so important that you’re electing a president who has some internal sense of propriety and norms as to how you’re going to exercise power, in the same way that you want somebody who’s going to exercise the pardon power judiciously. Here, because of this decision, it is now, I think, beyond imperative that you are electing somebody like George Washington, who understands not running for office because of needing to have a peaceful transfer of power, because the Supreme Court, I think, in this majority decision has gone full MAGA. Mary McCord: Well, I’m speechless there. I hear all of these concerns. And part of the reason I started with the idea of let’s think about is this as broad as the dissent says it is or as narrow as the majority tries to send it is, is because I’m trying to think if I’m continuing to litigate here, what are my arguments against that broad reading, right?   Andrew Weissmann: I love this.   Mary McCord: What are my arguments against --  Andrew Weissmann: Tuck me off the ledge. Tuck me off the ledge. Mary McCord: Yeah. And so, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I just want to say on page 37 what Chief Justice Roberts says, because he tries to give a narrow reading. And he says, as for the dissents, they strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the court actually does today. Conclude that immunity extends to official discussions between the president and his attorney general and then remand to the lower courts to determine in the first instance whether and to what extent Trump’s remaining alleged conduct is entitled to immunity. So --  Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: -- that’s the description. Mary McCord: So that’s where the open door is, right? And so if I am Judge Chutkan and I am Jack Smith, I am thinking, how do I apply what the majority has told us and win? Of course, Judge Chutkan is not thinking, how do I win? She’s the judge. But if I’m Jack Smith, how do I apply that here and prove up to the satisfaction of Judge Chutkan and in a way that I think will eventually, if this case doesn’t go away, with a Trump win and a dismissal of the cases, a win in the election. If this case remains and there’s something to still be litigated, what arguments can I make that will fit into the analysis that the Supreme Court majority has said I have to engage in? Which goes back to that bucket, too, right, which is first, Judge Chutkan will have to see with the benefit of briefing. I think a lot of this will be legal briefing. Some will be factual development, particularly when it comes to some of these discussions with state legislators and use of the quote, unquote “bully pulpit” to speak to the members of the public.   She’ll be deciding are the acts official or unofficial acts, right. And official within the outer perimeter of official acts. And even if she were to determine that something is official acts, the majority has been clear that Jack Smith and the government get the opportunity to rebut that by showing that a prosecution for those official acts would not so interfere with executive functions that it would, you know, basically cause the type of separation of powers problem that the court says it’s trying to avoid. And so there’s a couple of steps there, right? Could be she would just determine on the legal analysis in the factual record. Not official. Could be. She says it is official. But let’s just take, for example, communications with Brad Raffensperger about finding 11,700 hundred votes, right? She could say, so under the Supreme Court’s guidance, I’m not suggesting this right answer. I’m just trying to put like some context, right.  Andrew Weissmann: Yeah.   Mary McCord: She could say, okay, the Supreme Court said, you know, there’s an interest in the presidency in speaking to legislators raising concerns about election integrity, et cetera. So I think that him having a conversation with Brad Raffensperger, expressing to Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state of Georgia, that there are anomalies in the counting of the votes in Georgia and that he should reconsider these or take this alleged fraud into consideration. I think that’s official acts. Jack Smith could come back and then make an argument. Yes. But here he went well beyond that. First of all, there was no proof of fraud. As the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger explained to him, they’d already done an investigation. They’d already done audits. They found no evidence of fraud. And the president, President Trump, went further than that and said, I just need you to find these and actually implicitly threatened the secretary of state, as you may recall from that very lengthy, I think, 102-minute phone call. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, I do. Mary McCord: And then Jack Smith’s argument would be prosecuting for that absolutely does not interfere with executive function, taking care that the laws be faithfully executed, because this is really just about trying to pressure, coerce someone into making up votes. Then Judge Chutkan could have in front of her then something to be the basis of saying, okay, that is something that is permissible for you to be prosecuted on. Two last points. Two of the other challenges with this ruling is that everything I just said, one of the other really bizarre points made by the majority is that you can’t look to the president’s motive for doing things if they’re once they’re within official acts, which means as corrupt as that motive may be, as bad as it may be, as criminal as it may be, that can’t be considered if the act itself is official. So to me, that’s a little bit in conflict with saying the government can rebut whether prosecution for this official act would infringe on core executive, because what part of that rebuttal, to my mind, would be to what we were just talking about. He’s corruptly trying to get Brad Raffensperger to make up 11,700 votes.   Andrew Weissmann: Yes, absolutely. Because if you just sit there and say you can take any action and describe it in a way that makes it sound like it would be within the outer perimeter, is there anything wrong with the president calling the Georgia secretary of state? Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: No, of course not. Is that criminal? Now, they are allowed under this decision, to put in the substance of the call. But if looking at his personal motive is so relevant. And by the way, I teach Fourth Amendment law. The court has allowed you to look at intent and motive in deciding what actions you took and how to evaluate what actions. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And also, of course, motive and intent, because we’re talking about a criminal matter, is core. But anyway -- Mary McCord: It’s key, right? It’s key.   Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: Intent is required in almost every single criminal prosecution. Andrew Weissmann: So how they actually deal with sort of what motive is, what isn’t, what’s in and what’s out, but that’s like, to use your phrase, thing one, which is that the state is not allowed to use motive and the court cannot consider that so Judge Chutkan could not consider it. And by the way, whatever she rules at this hearing is clearly going to come back. Mary McCord: Can go back up. Right. Andrew Weissmann: Right. There is like are you going to get to thing two? Mary McCord: Thing two. Like yeah, thing two. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, because thing two is big and that’s where -- Mary McCord: Thing two is huge. Andrew Weissmann: -- that’s where Justice Amy Coney Barrett actually -- Mary McCord: Really differs. Andrew Weissmann: -- she differs and she joins the dissents. So it’s 5-4 on the issue that you’re about to go to, Mary. Mary McCord: Right. And, you know, it’s funny because you just said the call comes in. And that makes me think of thing two, because the call, of course, at any hearing that Judge Chutkan has, will be able to listen to the whole call and make some determinations about whether it’s official or unofficial. But if she were to determine that it is official and that it wasn’t rebutted, thing two is the majority says you cannot, government, you cannot introduce evidence of official acts even to prove up the criminality of the unofficial acts. So once you get down to this core of something that’s unofficial that you can still prosecute on, you can’t use official acts as evidence of motive, of knowledge, of intent for the unofficial acts. Now, this would mean, for example, like I just said, if she were to conclude that the call was an official act, the Jack Smith would not be able to play that call, that recording of the phone call at trial, even if he was permitted to prove up other unofficial acts as part of the scheme, right, to actually overrule the will of the voters on January 6th. And this one so surprises me because the chief at argument --  Andrew Weissmann: Was so strong the other way, yes. Mary McCord: Yes. I also think it’s utterly perplexing because he drops a footnote to take on this example of bribery, which is the very example that he used in oral argument. He incredulously said to counsel for Trump. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: So are you telling me if a president promises an ambassadorial appointment in return for a bribe that the government can only introduce evidence of the appointment, but not the motive, the reason for that appointment, the bribe? And he said that can’t be. So he deals with that in a footnote and says, well, of course the government could put on public records evidence of the ambassadorial appointment and the government could put on evidence of the demand for a payment or whatever the bribe is in return for that ambassadorial appointment. So I’m not sure how that is squaring -- Andrew Weissmann: I agree. Mary McCord: -- with what he says in the text.   Andrew Weissmann: I know exactly because I don’t know what it means to say they could put on the appointment. The appointment came from the president. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And that’s an official act. I don’t understand the flip there. Mary McCord: I don’t either. Andrew Weissmann: So we address this so much because we were sort of saying Alito was sort of really trying to do something outrageous. But that’s where the court goes.  Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And what’s so interesting to me is on that it’s 5-4 because Barrett goes with the dissents. But I’m so surprised that the chief justice flipped to go with the majority here because essentially, he’s doing it. Mary McCord: But did flip (ph)? I don’t understand what they’re doing.  Andrew Weissmann: I mean, I think he did. I mean, he says it. I mean, he absolutely says. Mary McCord: But then you have the footnote. And here’s what he says in the footnote. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: What the prosecutor may not do is admit testimony or private records of the president or his advisors probing the official act itself. So that is doing some limiting work. It’s just not entirely clear. And I tell you, I’ve read that footnote and the paragraphs that it drops from like four times. And I still got to think more about that. Andrew Weissmann: It just makes it, I think, very hard to prove up, because if you can’t get into those details, how do you really show that this was done as a result of the bribe? Otherwise, you end up with a bribe and an appointment. But there always can be some legitimate. You could get money coming in. Mary McCord: A payment of money and an appointment. That’s what you get to tell the jury. Andrew Weissmann: Great. And I guess and they’ll be saying, but the money had nothing to do with it.  Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: There were independent reasons to do it. And you can’t put on any of the connective tissue. I just don’t understand how the chief justice flipped on that. I mean, and he seemed so incredulous, as you said, at the oral argument. And this is, I think, by the way, listeners should know the reason that we’re so focused on this is because, Mary, you and I are trial lawyers at heart. And so we’re thinking of just how difficult this makes a prosecution. Mary McCord: Depending on, again, the results of hearings about what’s official and unofficial, which are going to cover anything, makes it hard also, and I know we’ll come back to this probably after we talk with Trevor or while we’re talking with Trevor, what could Jack Smith do now, right -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- in light of this ruling? Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Perfect segue. So, let’s take a break and then we’ll come back and we will have a discussion with Trevor Morrison, who I know you and I are both dying to talk to, to get his read on this as a subject matter expert.   Mary McCord: Yep. See you after the break.   (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, our friend and Andrew’s colleague Trevor Morrison joins us now. He’s a law professor and the Dean Emeritus at New York University Law School. He was previously a professor at Columbia Law School and Cornell Law School and an associate counsel to President Barack Obama. So, Trevor, we have been talking for the last half hour or so about this decision, kind of on the broad strokes of what it says in terms of what things the former president has immunity for and what things he does not. But I think a lot of the area is gray, right? Official act immunity for things that are part of his core constitutionally committed responsibilities. But as Andrew and I have been discussing, the court read that more broadly than I think we would have. And I’m curious your view of that. No immunity for unofficial acts, but the devil is really in the details in the middle there. What about the things that are not core constitutionally committed responsibilities, but are within what seems to be quite an expansive reading of outer perimeter official acts? So I guess I’d love to just hear your big picture on all of this, and then maybe we can get into some more details and maybe even what are the available options for Jack Smith and the government and the judges in the lower courts? Trevor Morrison: Sure. I’m glad to be back with you. Yeah, I think the sort of highest level of generality is the court hasn’t announced a categorical sweeping immunity that can’t possibly be overcome by any of the charges that Jack Smith is purporting to bring against Trump. It has announced a much broader conception of immunity than I think it should have. And maybe most tellingly, it has left immense amounts of work to be done by the lower courts on remand to the extent the court thought it important to provide any sort of clear definitive answers to questions that are pertinent to this case. So I read the court to be saying that it’s really not going to be possible to pursue any charge against Trump that focuses on communications between Trump and the Department of Justice, for example, whether that is, you know, threatening to remove an acting attorney general or just, you know, interacting with anyone in the Justice Department. That’s just going to be all conceived of as part of an unreviewable exercise of official capacity authority of the president to oversee the Justice Department and to be ultimately responsible for taking care that the laws are faithfully executed. So the big story there, I think, is that the court apparently felt it incumbent upon itself to take some of the things off the table altogether by saying, you know, there’s just no way that these elements of the case will be able to go forward. Andrew Weissmann: Could I ask you about that? Because I think the theory there was that part of the Take Care Clause makes this something that sort of exclusively within the province of the presidency. And Trevor, I know when we had talked about this before the decision, you sort of had this idea that in that there would be some core -- Trevor Morrison: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- presidential functions that could be absolutely immune. But if you put it in the Take Care Clause, just to be a nerd here for our audience, I mean, where are the limits on that? They didn’t really, to me, articulate why that is limited to the Department of Justice. And that’s scary enough to think that a president can use the Department of Justice in any way, shape or form, or at least those communications with the department in any shape or form for criminal purposes. And that’s absolutely immune. And then take care could include so much more than just conversations with the attorney general. Trevor Morrison: I agree with all of that. So just to step back one-half step, right, you’re right that going into the oral argument in the case, I was among those who said that, you know, I think there is a very good argument. The president does enjoy a modest scope of what I would call absolute immunity. And I don’t think actually anyone on the court explicitly disagreed with that proposition. Some thought it was relevant to the case as currently postured, others thought not. But I would never have thought that the take care authority fell within that bucket. We’re talking about these things like the veto power, the pardon power, the recognition power, those elements of presidential power that belong to the president and belong to him so exclusively that they are not subject to regulation whatsoever.   And that’s the first category that Roberts began with. But as Justice Sotomayor points out in her dissent, that category essentially becomes irrelevant because it gets swamped by the second category, which is just a very broad conception of immunity for anything the president does in his official capacity, subject only to the overcoming the presumption that you described, Mary, if the government can show that even though the president acted in his official capacity here, pursuing these charges would not pose any danger of intrusion on the authority and functions of the executive branch.  We don’t know what it looks like to apply that standard. That’s some language drawn from the Nixon versus Fitzgerald case, but we really don’t have any really textured sense of what application of that standard will look like. So there’s that. Then, Andrew, what you’re asking about is what are we to make of references by the court to the Take Care power? I don’t know that the majority has to be read as broadly as Justice Sotomayor worries about in dissent. She may be right that the court seems to be suggesting that any element of the Take Care power is beyond regulation by Congress. That just doesn’t make any sense to me insofar as what it means to take care that the laws are faithfully executed is you have to attend to the laws that are enacted by Congress. So I think what the majority opinion says about the president’s relationship to the Justice Department, at least on a first pass, I’m not justifying this. It seems like the court is just picking out that relationship between the president and the Justice Department as running especially to the core of presidential authority and just doubting that it will ever be possible to interpose a special counsel between the president and the Justice Department to pursue charges there. But the Take Care Clause doesn’t justify that move by itself. Or if it did, it would justify a whole lot more that I think goes beyond what even the court would be prepared to say.   Andrew Weissmann: So let’s just take a hypothetical. Let’s assume that there is a tape recording and video tape like the Brad Raffensperger call where the president says, I’m replacing the attorney general because I want to have a new attorney general who is going to institute a fraudulent case, and the person says that on tape. Now, the hypothetical is there’s no question. That’s what the conversation is.  Mary McCord: Let’s get more specific. I want my Justice Department to investigate all of my political enemies, including those who prosecuted me and I don’t care if there’s any validity or not. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. Mary McCord: That’s what I want him to do. Let’s say that’s explicit. Andrew Weissmann: And let’s assume that it’s actually worse than that. It’s like, I know that there’s no evidence, but I want to have them prosecuted. Trevor Morrison: Right. So I think this hypothetical is bringing us to some of the most shocking elements of today’s opinion. And they’re on two levels for me. One is what the court’s opinion says about presidential contacts with Justice Department leadership in general. I read the court to be saying that is always and in every case conduct in the president’s official capacity. We might agree with that because it’s going to be hard to imagine the president acting in a purely personal capacity when the attorney general takes his call and he’s only taking the call because it’s the president.   But then I think the court is also saying that it’s not prepared to accept that there would be any circumstance where a prosecutor could overcome the presumption of immunity in that case, that any charge would necessarily pose a danger of intrusion into the authority and function of the executive branch. And that’s shocking, but it’s more than that, right? The court also says in trying to figure out the boundaries of official conduct or not motive or purpose on the part of the president never matters.   And so all of the cases, Andrew, when you and I have talked about this in the past -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes.  Trevor Morrison: -- as a prosecutor, you rightly bring up that mens rea is often the whole thing that tells you about whether you’ve got a permissible purpose or a corrupt one. The court’s taking that off the table entirely for purposes of deciding whether the president has acted in his official capacity. And then it’s even worse because of somehow you could figure out that there was some aspect of what the president had done that was correctly understood to be him acting in his private capacity. The court has taken off the table the ability to rely on any official capacity acts to sort of inform our understanding there. I thought Justice Barrett had it exactly right in her concurrence when she says, well, then how could we ever under pursue, say, a bribery, you know, prosecution? You have to be able to talk about the quid and the quo. And all that the chief justice has to say in response to that as well, you can rely on public information, but suppose it’s a phone call between the president and the attorney general along the lines of what you’ve hypothesized. Mary McCord: Andrew and I were talking about this at the break, and this is one of the more surprising parts of the opinion, because the chief during oral arguments seemed to be exactly where Justice Barrett is. And so this seemed like a complete flip. And his footnote does seem to be a little bit in opposition to the broad brush of you can’t put on, you know, any evidence of official acts. And if the only difference, is you can only put on public record, not the only difference because it’s a big difference, but you can put on, you know, public record information, but not the reasons for it, I don’t see how you’re any less hamstrung than you would be if you couldn’t put on, you know, any of it.   Trevor Morrison: Yeah. I mean, I think there are multiple ways to think about that footnote, too. And I’ve been puzzling over it. Mary McCord: I’ve read it five times trying to say, is this actually pulling back on what’s in the text? Is there still an opening here? How do you apply this? Trevor Morrison: I mean, one question is, once Justice Barrett wrote what she wrote, why didn’t the chief just go along with it? I assume he was going to lose Alito and Thomas over this. And so, and might there have been a possibility of a different five at that point -- Mary McCord: So what? Lose them.  Trevor Morrison: Well, then you lose your court. Andrew Weissmann: I have a question. What is that in the context of this decision? What would that mean to lose them? In other words -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- like they were going to sign on to this. Maybe they wanted to be further. Mary McCord: They could dissent from that part, right? Andrew Weissmann: I don’t understand why it wasn’t 5-4 the other way, because it ended up being 5-4 on this issue. I don’t --  Trevor Morrison: Right. Mary McCord: I just couldn’t understand why he didn’t go along with Barrett. Trevor Morrison: I think it’s a great question. I’ve wondered, I mean, from the oral argument, I thought, okay, this is awfully a consequential case. Presumably the chief justice will want to write. But if, you know, remember the Halcyon days when we thought maybe the court would want to decide this case quickly, you know, the quickest path to that would have been to give it to Barrett based on her questions during oral arguments.  Mary McCord: Yes. Trevor Morrison: And her short concurrence is super smart. As you know, although I’ve thought it was fine to call it immunity in the space of exclusive responsibility, she said, I wouldn’t call it immunity, but I would let the president raise it on the front end, which is really the only thing that mattered to me. And then she kind of folds in the clear statement rule of sorts by deciding you have to figure out whether the statute applies. She wouldn’t quite use the clear statement rule. Mary McCord: Yeah, she wouldn’t say you have to. It has to clearly say it applies to the president. But yeah. Trevor Morrison: Right. But she said that the layers of protection here are first, does the statute even govern the president? And second, does it implicate? And so -- Mary McCord: The Constitution, yeah. Trevor Morrison: I wondered almost, was there the possibility of, say, the three dissenters joining Barrett? And then does it come down to this evidentiary thing as the reason the chief wouldn’t have gone along with that position? Because as troubling as the majority opinion is on a number of these points, the greatest trouble is just going to be in the difficulty and time it will take to sort out these questions. And if you thought that the questions that the lower court had to face were as described in Justice Barrett’s concurring opinion, the path going forward would look clearer. And Barrett, at least, says for most of them, except this evidentiary one, that’s what she thinks the court is saying. Mary McCord: Yeah.  Trevor Morrison: And so there was a more minimalist thing here. Mary McCord: That’s a perfect segue. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Let’s take a quick break. And when we come back, Trevor, maybe talk to us a little bit more for people who haven’t read or are in the weeds on Barrett’s decision. Maybe we can go over just a broad brush what it says. But then let’s talk about sort of for this particular case, even though this case is so huge for America writ large, let’s try and talk about what we think is going to happen now with this decision. But let’s take a quick break. Trevor Morrison: Sure. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Welcome back. Trevor, for those of us who have not read Chapter and Verse on Justice Barrett, who I have to say this term has really sort of been really interesting to watch, and is definitely an active mind. And not that everyone’s going to agree with her on everything, but has proved to be an independent thinker. Also, by the way, just a note, beautiful writer. But can you walk us through sort of what you think is sort of the key parts of her? Like, how does she come out? What’s her reasoning? Trevor Morrison: Sure. Let me just agree with what you said in general about her. I’ll go further with no real offense intended to the other two Trump nominees. I think in the course of this term, Justice Barrett has showed herself to be by far the most nuanced and careful and insightful thinker of the Trump nominees, not even close. Mary McCord: Agree. Trevor Morrison: So in this case, she first of all sort of resists the idea that we would be talking about this as immunity at all, but she thinks there are constitutionally and statutorily based limits on the prosecutability of a president. And she would think about it in two steps. And she thinks that both of these steps need to be addressed pre-trial, not simply as defenses in trial. And she thinks that both of them should be able to be pursued on appeal pre-trial. So that’s functionally operating kind of like an immunity doctrine, though she wouldn’t call it that. The first she says is, look, you can imagine things that presidents might do that are deeply objectionable to people, but that doesn’t mean always that it violates the law. And so she gives examples, an interesting one from the Obama administration that was raised by the Trump people, was Obama’s ordering of a targeted drone attack on a United States citizen. And there is a federal statute that prohibits murder when done by U.S. personnel.  There’s also an office of legal counsel opinion that’s been made public in the years since then that took up this very question, but didn’t decide it in terms of constitutional doctrine of presidential immunity or anything like that. It said there is a background principle of statutory interpretation that says the general homicide statutes don’t apply to public authorities like law enforcement or the military when they’re operating within the scope of their authority. And so the public authority exception, she says, look, I’m not saying this has anything to do with this case, but that’s an example of how just figuring out whether the statute even applies to presidential action that we would otherwise think is unlawful in other circumstances not involving the president, that’s a real limit on the extent to which the president is prosecutable. And then she would say, okay, if the statute by its terms does govern the president, and she’s not using a clear statement rule here, to be clear. She’s not saying the statute would have to call out the president by office in order for it to apply. If it as ordinarily interpreted, including using rules like the public authority exception, should be understood to apply the president’s actions, would application of it in this case implicate some core constitutional concern? And I would call it immunity, but she would say the constitutional defense, if you want, that she would recognize for the president are where the president is exercising powers that he has been given by the Constitution exclusively and closely adjacent actions. She doesn’t define what that is, but she’s imagining things that maybe it’s not literally within the president’s exclusive power, but it’s very close to something that is exclusively the president’s. And she would give him a kind of buffer. I’ve been wondering if the way to think about that is something like a qualified immunity buffer around exclusive presidential authority. Andrew Weissmann: To take a term that I don’t think people use anymore, a penumbra. Mary McCord: Yeah. Trevor Morrison: An emanation on a penumbra? Yeah, possibly. And she says, if we think about it that way, there will be lots of times when even though the conduct in question is official, it’s official conduct, there’s no reason to think that there’s any constitutional problem with pursuing the prosecution because it doesn’t implicate any core presidential power or any closely adjacent activity.   Now, she says this in the course of concurring in the majority opinion, not concurring in the judgment, but concurring in it. So, one way to read this is that her more straightforward, I think, simpler, more concise, easier to understand standard, she thinks is compatible with what the majority has said. I think there’s going to be a lot of play in the joints. I mean, one possibility on remand is that the law will end up looking, if we ever apply any of this, will end up looking like what Justice Barrett has said. But I think there are also opportunities to read the immunity much more broadly, given language that Roberts used in different parts of his opinion. Mary McCord: For example, she goes further than the majority. You know, what the majority does is says some things, the communications with the Department of Justice that are absolutely immune, doesn’t carve out anything that is definitely only unofficial conduct. But she would, in a footnote, she makes clear. She says, take the president’s alleged attempt to organize alternate slates of electors. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. And so, even though she said sometimes it might be hard to sort official conduct from unofficial conduct, she says, it’s not always going to be difficult. And this is a place where it’s not difficult. The majority didn’t go that far. They basically said, we’re going to send this back to Judge Chutkan to figure out in the first instance after briefing and factual development, but even suggested with respect to that scheme that, you know, there’s parts of the president’s communications with state legislators and others that might be official. Trevor Morrison: Yeah, I agree with you. I think so in principle and maybe in practice, it will be possible, I think, for the lower court to come out on the fake elector scheme where Justice Barrett would come out. But just as a matter of, you know, exercising the judicial power in an institutionally minded way, I think it’s quite unsettling that the Chief Justice saw no need to provide even one illustration of something that would fall --  Mary McCord: Yes. Trevor Morrison: -- on the not immune side of the ledger. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Trevor Morrison: He took some things categorically off the table, like interaction with the Justice Department. Mary McCord: That’s right. Trevor Morrison: Why not say that on the allegations in the complaint, of course, they have to be proved, but on the allegations in the complaint, the interaction with the fake slates of electors is obviously not official conduct. Or for that matter, why not tell us how the SEAL Team 6 hypothetical comes out? Mary McCord: Right. Trevor Morrison: Now, I understand that’s just a hypothetical, but Justice Sotomayor is left to say in dissent that it looks like the majority opinion would treat that as immune. Mary McCord: That’s right. Trevor Morrison: Now, I don’t know if that has to be the way to read the majority opinion. I think it’s clearly official capacity conduct. So it’s just the question of whether the prosecution could overcome the presumption there. But the fact that the majority didn’t even feel the need to speak to that issue. Mary McCord: That’s right. Trevor Morrison: There’s this one sidedness to the issues that did resolve that Justice Sotomayor points out, and I think in a very convincing way. Andrew Weissmann: Well, to me, I think that’s a really key part of this, which is to the extent that you saw this sort of policy debate as to what are you more worried about? Are you worried about prosecutors run amok? Are you worried about presidents run amok? And you saw that at the oral argument. The idea that you’re going to come out on the, we’re worried about prosecutors run amok, but we’re not going to do even a brushback pitch to say in the oral argument, don’t start thinking about this because that’s a problem.   Mary McCord: Right. Trevor Morrison: Right. Andrew Weissmann: There wasn’t any attempt to give those kinds of categories, even the claim about what would be personal conduct. They say perhaps not even saying it’s sure, but perhaps when you’re acting as a candidate, that would be personal. And I was like, what do you mean, perhaps? It’s like --  Trevor Morrison: They walk back Trump’s lawyer’s own concession on that point.   Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. Trevor Morrison: Yeah. Mary McCord: That’s what I was just going to say. They didn’t even accept the concessions. They sort of said, ah, that’s what one lawyer says, you know, at argument, but you still have to look at it independently. So that did feel very one-sided. Trevor Morrison: Yeah. I mean, I recall Justice Gorsuch’s comment during oral argument, which was pilloried a bit by some commentators afterwards that, look, when we decide this case, he’s admonishing, I think, Michael Dreeben at that point, we’re writing for the ages. Well, then to decide to write for the ages, and I don’t know, it’s like writing only for the odd number of years in the ages -- Mary McCord: Right. Trevor Morrison: -- or something like that. I mean, it’s a very one-sided approach to the kinds of issues that needed to be resolved and then that were going to be left unresolved. Mary McCord: So what do you do? What do you do if you’re Jack Smith and if you’re Judge Chutkan? Andrew Weissmann: I mean, I take it you think that there can be and there will be a hearing before Judge Chutkan. Obviously, there isn’t going to be a trial because all of her conclusions can be appealed. Trevor Morrison: Right. Andrew Weissmann: But I take it there can be, upon briefing, which the Supreme Court pointedly said she should have, meaning it can’t be immediate, there’ll be briefing. Trevor Morrison: Right. Andrew Weissmann: But it sounds like there will be a hearing. And so, you know, the small picture is I think there will be an opportunity for Jack Smith to call witnesses and witnesses that have not necessarily been heard from before the January 6th hearing to wit the former vice president of the United States, various lawyers for the White House who testified in part but not fully before the January 6th committee. Those may be part of what’s allowed, but they will run up with a lot of objections as to what they can say. Trevor Morrison: Yeah. I think it’s into that set of weeds that Jack Smith must now venture. I agree with you that, you know, unless the prosecution is going to be abandoned, and I assume it won’t be in the near term, the next thing is briefing and a hearing to try and go allegation by allegation. But whether the vice president could be called, who within the White House could be called without running afoul of this evidentiary limitation, which is the other big disagreement between, as we were discussing, between the chief justice and Justice Barrett.   Justice Barrett is with Justice Sotomayor and the other dissenters on the unwisdom of having an evidentiary bar there. So I think evidentiary hearings on communications with the fake slates of electors and with state level officials is easier to imagine happening over any objection, whereas I think just the act of objecting to trying to put on the former vice president or high-ranking White House officials itself may need to go up on appeal before the hearing even happens. I don’t know. But it seems to be a dimension of the immunity, according to the chief justice.   Mary McCord: I think there’ll be that argument. But I didn’t read the majority to be saying for purposes of pretrial motions where you’re trying to decide what’s official and unofficial, because how would you even know what’s official and can’t come in as evidence when you’re still trying to figure out what’s official and what’s unofficial? I read it to be once those decisions are made, the things that fall on the official side of the lever can’t be introduced as evidence at trial. But all of that said, that doesn’t mean Trump’s attorneys won’t make the very argument you just teed up. Trevor Morrison: I think it would make sense for the rule to be as you’ve described, but dinner is on me, Mary -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Right  Trevor Morrison: -- if Trump’s lawyers don’t raise the argument. Andrew Weissmann: Trevor, do you have any last thoughts on sort of either small picture or just big picture in terms of what you think this means? I mean, I sort of went off the deep end before you came on about big picture because I thought this decision was so much worse than I anticipated. I had read what you had written about this and I’d listened to you speak about it. And so I was all in on the Trevor Morrison approach. But I think this is about as close to applying the civil standard with some aspects that are even worse though, as we talked about in terms of the evidentiary components. And I just wondered what you thought sort of big picture, how people should be thinking about this in terms of the presidency in our democracy. Trevor Morrison: Yeah, it’s a shocking decision to me. As you said, I’m among those who have said that just under some standard separation of powers principles, there is a core of presidential conduct that I would say is properly recognized as immune from prosecution or that the Constitution bars prosecution of. And that’s like the first subsection of the chief justice’s opinion. But Justice Sotomayor is right that readers can just ignore that section because it is swamped by the rest of what the chief justice says. And the rest of what he says is an incredibly broad articulation of the theory of the immunity. I think an even more surprisingly broad semi-application of that theory in the context where he would apply it and an extension of the idea on this evidentiary privilege piece. And so, you know, the court kind of bats away objections from the dissent and from punditry and others that this would place the president above the law.   I think it’s Justice Thomas and his concurrence. He says, no, no, no, presidential immunity is part of our law. So the president isn’t above the law. But frankly, those are just word games. If the answer to the president’s not supposed to be above the law is that, well, the doctrine of absolute presidential immunity is part of our law, so he’s not above it. Well, that would just be like saying that the monarch’s immunity is not placing the monarch above the law as long as the law recognizes it. The long-term implications here are to suggest that the circumstances in which the president can be held to account in the courts for even blatant illegality are far fewer than I think any of us supposed. And the court today said that in the name of, it said, protecting the presidency without, to my mind, nearly enough attention to what it takes to protect the rule of law and our constitutional democracy. The country is much worse today than it was yesterday. Andrew Weissmann: And if you think of our history, the examples of presidential abuse are much more legion and worrisome than the examples of prosecutorial abuse when it comes to the president, where, you know, the only thing you could really point to is either Nixon, which everyone agrees happened, or this, where we just had a conviction on the first of the charges. And there’s no reason to think that this didn’t happen. Certainly, the Mar-a-Lago case is totally open and shut. So that the concern for abuse is one I was really surprised about how this read in terms of we’re so concerned about the tit-for-tat, which was the Donald Trump argument when we have no history of that. Whereas you have had concerns about the misuse of the powers of the presidency, not just with Donald Trump. Trevor Morrison: Indeed. And the court, I think, is going to make it harder for the legal system to hold that kind of abuse to account in the future. Mary McCord: Well, Trevor, I, for one, I’m going to try to take what the majority said about this ruling is not as broad as the defense argued it is and see that as the opening here to salvage something. We are so grateful to you for joining us. Andrew and I will be back tomorrow on Tuesday, our normal recording time. We’ll, you know, give listeners any further thoughts we’ve had overnight after we sleep on this, assuming we sleep. But we will also discuss tomorrow something that we haven’t had a chance to talk about yet, which is the Supreme Court’s decision on the obstruction of an official proceeding.  And I’d like to say that has no impact on the Trump case. And I think it doesn’t, except this immunity decision has far more impact on the Trump January 6 case than that decision would. At any rate, we will be joined with Ryan Goodman, New York University law professor and our co-author in a piece we wrote, Andrew and I and Ryan for “Just Security,” that really establishes with the statistics and the numbers that the effect of that ruling is going to be extremely minimal, even as to the rioters who were charged with this. So please tune in tomorrow for more on that. And thanks again, Trevor. Andrew Weissmann: Thanks, Trevor. Trevor Morrison: Thanks for having me. Mary McCord: Thanks so much for listening.

Simone Biles is the best to ever do it. Here’s an overlooked reason why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/simone-biles-olympics-trial-stumble-reminds-us-great-rcna159875,"On Sunday night, Simone Biles made history once again, defying physics, gravity and precedent by becoming the oldest female gymnast to make an Olympic team in 72 years. In the first tumbling pass of her floor routine, the 27-year-old launched herself 12 feet in the air, a superhuman spectacle that sent fans and commentators into raptures, including NBC Olympics reporters who gushed on X that Biles was “LITERALLY LAUNCHING INTO SPACE.” With its unique blend of high-stakes drama, gravity-defying physical feats, and chase-your-dream story arcs, it’s no mystery why women’s artistic gymnastics is among the most watched Olympic sporting events. The audience is held captive by two distinct emotions: the breathless tension of waiting for an athlete to land a skill and the utter astonishment at their superhuman capabilities if they do. Biles’ gobsmacking performance and spectacular career also serve as a reminder that the sport is still grappling with the darker side of ambition and the determination to constantly push one’s limits. One historic moment in particular captured the sport’s high stakes and even higher expectations: gymnast Kerri Strug’s second vault at the 1996 Olympic Games.  As the legend goes, the hotly contested team final was drawing to a close, with Russia right on Team USA’s tail, and one event to go. After injuring her ankle on the first vault, 19-year-old Strug limps away, visibly stricken with pain and terror. The stadium is breathless with anticipation and pre-emptive heartbreak. Then, in one of the most made-for-television scenes in Olympic history, she returns to the mat and takes off for her second vault, sticking the landing on one foot. Her face shrivels in agony as the crowd goes wild, and she is carried off in the arms of her coach, Bela Karolyi. The heroic vault not only helped Team USA clinch their first-ever gold medal, but also landed Strug talk show appearances, a Sports Illustrated cover, a meeting with President Bill Clinton and the inevitable feature on a Wheaties cereal box. Less than a year after Strug’s triumphant vault, Biles was born. Today, there isn’t a single aspect of the sport of gymnastics that she hasn’t impacted in some way. As the most decorated gymnast of all time, the 30-time world medal winner currently has five skills named after her in the sport’s Code of Points. In 2021, after Biles decided to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympic Games citing her mental health, some members of the gymnastics community revisited Strug’s legendary vault. The verdict was nearly unanimous: It did not age well. Biles’ decision sparked an ongoing conversation about the safety and well-being of athletes in a sport where pushing your body to the physical limits of human potential tends to be the norm, rather than the exception.  “I’ve already seen comments and posts about how Biles ‘failed her country,’ ‘quit on us,’ or ‘can’t be the greatest if she can’t handle the pressure,’” one viral Facebook post read at the time. “Those statements are no different than Coach Karolyi telling an injured teen with wide, frightened eyes: ‘We got to go one more time. Shake it out.’ The subtext here is: ‘Our gold medal is more important than your well-being.’” The renewed debate signaled that the culture of women’s gymnastics had changed dramatically in the last 27 years. First, there’s the unprecedented dominance of the United States women’s team. Since 1996, they’ve earned an astonishing seven consecutive team medals at the Olympic Games and nine gold medals at world championships. The sport has also endured massive scandals, including the conviction of disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nasser, and the major shakeup to the sport’s leadership that followed.  The revelations about gymnastics’ toxic culture, coupled with the most dominant athlete in U.S. gymnastics history deciding to step aside to prioritize her mental health, seem to at least suggest a more positive and safe environment for athletes.  But watching this year’s U.S. Olympic Team trials, the shadow of Strug’s pain-enduring grimace seemed to be everywhere. On Day 1, dozens of competitors suffered wobbles, falls and injuries. It’s not because they’re lousy athletes — they’re unquestionably the best of the best. It’s because gymnastics is a mental battlefield, and all its players are in the line of fire. Commentators often describe this phenomenon as a competition “curse.” Once one athlete goes down, the spell becomes contagious.  Even Biles isn’t immune. Although her spot on Team USA is all but guaranteed, the 27-year-old nearly fell off the balance beam at the start of her routine on Day 1, despite being a four-time world champion in the event. She made no secret of how she felt about this. Fortunately, Biles has such a comfortable lead over her competitors that she could have completely fallen off the beam — and did, in fact, during Sunday’s finals — and still earned a spot on the team. Some of her fellow Olympic hopefuls weren’t as lucky. In the first 30 minutes of NBC’s broadcast, Kayla DiCello was taken away in a wheelchair in tears. Another fan favorite, Shilese Jones, struggled through her bars routine before pulling out of the trials altogether. With insurmountable pain written on her face, the camera emphatically cut away to her mother, who was sitting in the audience, also in tears. The abundant display of emotions underscores just how young the athletes are; many have yet to graduate high school. For most of them, going to the Olympics has been their dream since the time they learned to walk. Nearly all of their families made enormous sacrifices for them to be here. The pressure they’re feeling is about more than gaining Instagram followers or endorsement deals.  With the help of role models like Biles, gymnasts trying out for the Olympics today are given more space to push back against unrealistic pressure from a toxic culture that puts the team’s success over their individual well-being. These young athletes are claiming more ownership over their dreams and doing it for themselves. And somehow, that makes it all the more heartbreaking when we witness a fall, a missed step, a painful injury. Ironically, it’s this very pressure each athlete puts on themselves that makes women’s gymnastics so compelling to watch. The gut-wrenching agony of falls, slips and injuries reflects a crucial paradox about gymnastics: It makes the sport patently unwatchable, and at the same time, impossible to turn away from. While a certain amount of injuries and hardship is expected in any sport, it doesn’t make it any easier to watch athletes grimace through the pain of pushing their bodies to the outer limits of human capability. But 27 years after Strug’s heroic vault turned a toxic precedent into an immortal legacy, we can only hope that Biles’ unparalleled influence on the sport will help convey the message that your well-being is worth much more than a gold medal — or your face on a box of Wheaties."
DeSantis’ latest veto could have Floridians swimming in poop,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 3:14 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-veto-florida-beaches-sewage-rcna159849,"When conservative justices on the Supreme Court overturned the Chevron precedent last week — and essentially hampered federal agencies, or their experts, from instituting regulations as they see fit — it was a devastating attack in the GOP’s war on fact-based governance. Donald Trump’s Republican Party is a cult of personality that rejects empirical data when it’s inconvenient and crusades against institutions that impede its political goals. And at both the national level and state level, this movement is moving in sync. A new veto by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is proof positive. Among four vetoes announced by DeSantis last week, one of the bills — the bipartisan Senate Bill 165 — involved beach closures over water quality. According to the Tallahassee Democrat: In a letter justifying his decision, DeSantis claimed that the Florida Department of Health “should not be vested with the power to supersede local jurisdictions regarding the operation of beaches.” That sentence doesn’t really complete the thought, though, does it? What he’s really saying is that the department shouldn’t be vested with the power to close beaches even if it determines those beaches are rife with hazardous materials that could harm beachgoers. It shouldn’t surprise you that this is the same guy who cut funding for stormwater drainage while residents in his state were being battered by a tropical storm. Cruel and unusual lawmaking is DeSantis’ modus operandi. And he’s been on a veto tear this legislative session in particular, with many of his other vetoes exhibiting his far-right ideology. The SB 165 veto is arguably the most dangerous one for Floridians. A recent study listed two of the state’s beaches as being among the most polluted in the U.S., after their waters were found to have loads of harmful chemicals, stormwater runoff and raw sewage. You read that right: raw sewage. On that note, the Florida Department of Health recently issued a warning about other beaches due to potential fecal pollution, after finding high traces of a literally sickening bacteria — Enterococcus — that’s often found in human stool. Just another day in the life of Ron DeSantis: Florida’s anti-“woke” crusader. Owning the libs and undermining government institutions, all so Floridians can keep their right to backstroke in poopy water that may make them ill."
Why I’m not ready to count President Joe Biden out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 3:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-age-debate-disaster-trump-rcna159743,"This morning, we woke up to a sea of headlines and opinion pieces from major news organizations, former party leaders and loud whispers — mostly behind the scenes — from present leading Democrats who say it’s over for President Joe Biden. The New York Times editorial board says Biden is not the man he was four years ago, calling his candidacy a “reckless gamble.” Editors at Georgia’s largest newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, echoed that take, demanding that the president “pass the torch.” “Biden deserves a better exit from public life than the one he endured when he shuffled off the stage Thursday night,""  the board wrote. More than three days later, it is still hard to comprehend what we saw from the president on the debate stage. His performance was an unmitigated disaster by any measure. The weak, raspy voice, the inability to complete basic thoughts, and, most importantly, the failure to call out Donald Trump on his endless lies. And yet, the very next day in North Carolina, there was Biden, back to form, finding his voice, his winning smile, and the vintage sparkle back in his eyes. The two appearances were as different as, well, night and day.  On debate night, Biden was fresh off back-to-back trips to Europe. First, to Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day and a state dinner with President Emmanuel Macron. And then to Italy for the G7, followed by a flight across the globe to L.A. for a fundraiser with former President Barack Obama. Just 33 hours later, he was headed back to the East Coast. I question his schedule. It makes me angry that he was moving across the world in four different time zones. This is a lack of discipline. These were important events, but the stakes could not be any higher. Like many, I want to know: Was this a one-off episode, or a sign of what’s to come? Can his team — and the president himself — move forward with more discipline and also manage the fact that he is 81 years old? So let's talk about his age. Age is wisdom and experience that in the case of Biden leads to more bipartisan legislation passed than any president over the past few generations and the largest expansion of NATO’s alliance in history. Under Joe Biden, despite his age, America is stronger economically and militarily than at any time in a half-century. And while facts may not matter to Trump and his friends in far-right media, those are the objective facts and that is the undeniable truth.  But here's another truth: Age also needs to be managed.  With my 50 Over 50 lists, I celebrate women who are reaching their highest power well over 50, 60, 70, 80, even 90 years old. And every one of those women are managing their fabulous age. I don’t think it’s over. This moment in the race fits the entire narrative of Biden’s life. In his personal and professional life, Biden has repeatedly risen up from rock bottom. It’s what we love about him. So many draw hope from his ability to have perspective and to persevere when he is completely counted out. His list of losses and failures is long and would be unbearable for most. In 1972, his first wife and baby daughter were killed in a car accident. He had just been elected to the Senate and took his oath of office in his surviving sons’ hospital room to remain by their bedsides. In 1987, his first campaign for president came to an end, and so nearly did his life, when a few months later, he suffered a brain aneurysm. It was so severe that his doctor told him his chance of survival was less than half, and even if he lived, a long list of physical and mental limitations were likely. At his bedside before the surgery, he told his sons he was proud of them.  Joe Biden survived the surgery. Rehabilitated. And didn’t look back. In 2008, his second bid for the presidency came to another early end, after a poor showing in Iowa. He finished near the bottom with less than 1% of the vote, his campaign bottoming out — another low blow. And yet, that summer, Biden would be on the Democratic ticket as Obama’s running mate. Five years later, a year into his second term as vice president, Biden’s son Beau was diagnosed with brain cancer, believed to have been caused by his exposure to burn pits while serving in Iraq as a captain in the Army National Guard. Beau would die two years later, the second child Joe Biden would have to bury — the lowest of lows in his life. In 2015, there was another political failure when Obama chose to support Hillary Clinton as his heir apparent and not his own vice president. After numerous political and personal setbacks, Joe Biden may have questioned whether he would ever return to presidential politics again. And then came Charlottesville and the vile racist march by white supremacists and Neo-nazis across the University of Virginia campus. As a direct response to what he saw as a threat to our nation’s core values, Biden announced his third try for the White House. And just like his first two presidential campaigns, he was staring at an early exit in the race, stumbling in the first Democratic debate after a broadside by Kamala Harris. He finished a distant fourth in Iowa and an even worse fifth in New Hampshire. All experts, just like right now, said it was over for the man from Scranton. It was quite an awkward interview on the set of ""Morning Joe"" in New Hampshire. Awkward for everyone but Joe Biden. As his political obituary was being written, Biden was joyful and ready to keep fighting. “Our” Joe, Joe Scarborough, wrote a piece for The Washington Post at the time, titled “No matter how this race ends, I’m proud of Joe Biden."" “Whether his campaign can survive the body blows delivered by Iowa and New Hampshire remains to be seen, but Joe Biden has endured worse,"" he wrote. And yet once again, Biden found a way up from rock bottom. South Carolina gave his campaign new life, he secured the Democratic nomination, and the rest is historic — literally. As president, his legislative wins are unmatched: The American Rescue Plan, The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — the first legislative action on guns in decades — and the CHIPS and Science Act. Biden expanded health care for veterans through the PACT Act, signed marriage equality into law, and got the Inflation Reduction Act passed to address rising costs of living and deliver historic action on the climate. He appointed and got confirmation of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. He protected the Affordable Care Act and provided billions in student debt relief. He negotiated the toughest, most conservative border control bill in decades, only to see it get torpedoed by Trump, who cynically didn’t want a solution to the problem, only an issue to demagogue and campaign on. All the while, Biden solidified key international alliances, expanded NATO, and rallied the world in support of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. And right now, he is managing not one but two hot wars. Days after the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, Biden got on Air Force One to attend an Israeli war Cabinet meeting in person. This, after going to Kiev, Ukraine, by train via Poland, despite the tremendous risk and difficult conditions. Through it all, he delivered the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years, the strongest dollar in 50 years, and the most successful stock market of all time. So now, after Thursday’s abysmal debate performance, Biden finds himself at rock bottom again. And again, a chorus of Biden doubters has emerged. But my family and I have known this man and his family for decades, and I still believe in Joe. I’ve learned that counting him out is always a mistake and doing that now could be catastrophic for our country.  Do there need to be changes? Yes — both to his schedule and maybe even to those around him. And I’ll also say America needs an explanation and reassurance that the other night was a one-time event, not part of a larger problem. Biden likes to tell people, “Don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative."" So let’s take a quick look at the current alternative. Not a hypothetical, imagined new Democratic candidate, but the actual current alternative who was across from Biden at Thursday’s debate: Donald Trump.  The man who incited a political coup against our government and who indicates he won’t accept the results of the 2024 election if he loses again. The convicted felon, who faces three more indictments. The man who was found liable for sexual assault. The man who was found liable for business fraud. The man who brags about having ended a woman’s constitutional right to abortion — a decision that is killing women and babies and causing immeasurable and preventable agony for women across the country. The man whose tax proposals could cripple the economy, according to over a dozen Nobel prize economists. The man who would end key global alliances. The man who has promised retribution against his perceived political enemies. The man who, on a regular basis, makes no sense at all. Why aren’t there calls for Trump to drop out? Where are they? The Philadelphia Inquirer’s editorial board took a stand, writing, “To serve his country, Donald Trump should leave the race."" But where are the other editorial heads — leaders who see Trump as so unfit — saying that he should leave the race? Too many have become desensitized, misinformed and inured to Trump. His firehose of falsehoods has blinded some to what is right in front of you every day. Last week, ""our"" Joe said it may be time for Biden to consider stepping aside. He also said we should wait a few days to see how the president responds. We are shoulder to shoulder on that. I do agree that Biden has work to do. He has to do better. His team has to do a lot better. But I’m just not ready to count Biden out — not even close. Just as Joe and I were stunned by the president’s poor performance on the debate stage, we have also been surprised all weekend by the level of animosity toward Trump from people who once supported him. The debate acted as a wake-up call that was a loss for Biden, but not a win for Trump. The choice is one terribly bad night, versus a decade of destruction to our core beliefs, our democratic values and, yes, our Constitution. Someone who stumbled over his words for 90 minutes, versus someone who lied to the American people over and over. A man slowed by a cold, versus a man with a cold, vile and merciless heart. I think in the days and weeks ahead as we move away from this debate, clarity will hopefully set in. For me, Joe Biden is still the man for the moment. This is an adapted excerpt from the July 1 episode of “Morning Joe.”"

Red states’ religious mandates for schools ignore basic history,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 2:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/oklahoma-louisiana-bible-ten-commandments-history-rcna159798,"In recent weeks, red-state Republican officials have revived a long-running conflict over religion in the public schools. In doing so, they have created an ahistorical justification for the Supreme Court to immolate long-settled precedents. First, Louisiana adopted a state law requiring that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted in every public school classroom. Not to be outdone, Oklahoma’s Superintendent of Public Instruction then announced that the state’s Board of Education would require public school teachers to use not just the Ten Commandments in their instruction, but also the Bible. Normally, we could state with confidence that both measures would be struck down by the courts, simply because the Supreme Court already struck them down decades ago. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms was unconstitutional. The court’s ruling against state-mandated Bible reading is even older than that, a 1963 decision striking down a Pennsylvania program.  But we no longer live in normal times. The current Supreme Court, one of the most radical in American history, has shown staggering contempt for long-established precedents and a willingness to fabricate new constitutional rationales out of thin air. Republican-led states, recognizing that the old rules no longer apply, have resurrected divisive culture wars issues that were once assumed to be settled. In an apparent effort to provide the court’s conservative majority with enough pretense to cast aside precedent, the new requirements in Louisiana and Oklahoma have been framed in an unusual way. The previous rulings by the Supreme Court naturally deemed mandates to promote the Ten Commandments and the Bible as “plainly religious in nature” and therefore clear violations of the First Amendment’s ban on the establishment of religion by the government. The new requirements coming out of Louisiana and Oklahoma, in contrast, have been crudely disguised as “secular” efforts to teach children key aspects of American history, rather than fundamental tenets of the Christian faith. When Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the Louisiana measure, for instance, he argued that posting the Ten Commandments would promote civics to public school students. “If you want to respect the rule of law,” he said, “you’ve got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.” The law’s language likewise argues that religious texts are somehow essentially secular, claiming that the Ten Commandments were “foundational documents of our state and national government.” Oklahoma lawmakers have employed similar justifications. “The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters. “Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation.” Such claims, however, are not borne out by actual history. Moses was not, in fact, “the original lawgiver.” The Code of Ur-Nammu and the Code of Hammurabi, to name two examples, were composed centuries before Moses lived. Even within the Bible’s own chronology, Noah advanced a set of moral laws long before Moses. The Ten Commandments were not, in fact, “foundational documents” for the government of the United States of America. There are aspects of the criminal code, of course, that overlap with some of the Ten Commandments. We have laws against murder and theft, and in some locales there are still laws against adultery, too. But just as many commandments have no counterpart in our criminal code, such as those against coveting your neighbor’s goods or “taking the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.” Most important, several of the Ten Commandments come into conflict with the Constitution. They contain specific mandates about exactly which specific God to worship, how to worship him, and when. These are direct religious instructions and they clash directly with the Constitution’s guarantee that individual citizens are free to worship — or not worship — any god, any way, anywhere. Likewise, the Bible was not, in fact, an “indispensable historical … touchstone” that now must be taught to students if they are to understand the founding of the United States. The founding generation was quite diverse in its thinking on countless subjects, including religion. Some were deeply influenced by it; others, not at all. Thomas Jefferson famously took a razor to his Bible to cut out anything remotely supernatural. What the founders did agree on, they set down in the Constitution, which is the actual “foundational document” for our government. Notably, there are only three references to religion in the Constitution, and every single one makes clear that the founders wanted religion kept at arm’s length from the government, and vice versa. Article VI bans all “religious tests” for office, a revolutionary change and a clear rejection of the theocratic crises that had rocked Europe for centuries. The First Amendment, meanwhile, bans the establishment of a national religion and the interference of the national government in the freedom of citizens to worship however they see fit. The founding generation believed that this arrangement was necessary for the protection of individual religions as well as the national state. The concept of a “wall of separation between church and state” came from Jefferson’s letter to the Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut, who worried that state-level laws there would impinge on their right to worship freely. Religion and government, Jefferson noted, could thrive only if they occupied separate spheres. If the Republican leaders of Oklahoma and Louisiana were sincere in their desire to teach students about the “foundational documents” of America and the proper role of religion in public life, they would post the Constitution on our classroom walls. Or, if they want a list of 10 items, the Bill of Rights."
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent is a clarion call against corruption,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 2:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/justice-jackson-dissent-supreme-court-grifters-rcna159828,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is calling out her fellow justices for enabling grifters.  At the end of last week, the Supreme Court continued its assault on public corruption laws with a Thursday ruling that provides a roadmap to graft. Interpreting a federal statute that prohibits public officials from accepting bribes, the majority held in Snyder v. United States that, so long as a gift is given as a reward after the official performs the corrupt act, no crime occurs. Snyder is just the latest in a long line of cases issued by Chief Justice John Roberts’ court that have gutted public corruption cases. In recent years, the court has also cut back on the application of corruption statutes in several cases. As Jackson noted in her Snyder dissent, this “absurd and atextual reading of the statute is one only today’s Court could love.” At issue in Snyder is a federal statute we used frequently to prosecute corrupt government officials when I served as a federal prosecutor. Section 666 prohibits state and local officials from corruptly soliciting, demanding or accepting anything of value “intending to be influenced or rewarded” in connection with government business. The case involved James Snyder, a former mayor of Portage, Indiana. Snyder was convicted of accepting a $13,000 payout from Great Lakes Peterbilt after steering the city to buy trash trucks from the company at a cost of $1.1 million. But because the payment came after he bought the trucks, the Supreme Court concluded Snyder did not violate Section 666 and overturned his conviction. Writing for the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh concluded that while the statute prohibits bribes that are paid before the commission of a corrupt official act, it does not cover “gratuities,” which are paid afterwards. Among the reasons for its holding, the court noted that the statute would otherwise fail to provide fair notice as to whether conduct was criminal. “Is a $100 Dunkin’ Donuts gift card for a trash collector wrongful?” Kavanaugh wrote. “What about a $200 Nike gift card for a county commissioner who voted to fund new school athletic facilities? Could students take their college professor out to Chipotle for an end-of-term celebration? And if so, would it somehow become criminal to take the professor for a steak dinner? Or to treat her to a Hoosiers game?” The majority’s lamenting the criminalization of gifts to public officials, who, after all, receive a salary for their work, is a bad look. This is especially true given the recent ethics challenges plaguing some of the justices. Jackson, joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, forcefully pointed out the flaws in the court’s logic. First, the language of the statute itself includes the word “reward.” What happened to textualism? Jackson blasted the majority for elevating “nonexistent federalism concerns over the plain text of this statute.” She also criticized the majority for taking the view that applying Section 666 to gratuities would give too much power to federal prosecutors for crimes that should be handled at the state level. “But woulds, coulds, and shoulds of this nature must be addressed across the street with Congress, not in the pages of the U. S. Reports.” In other words, she argued, the court is legislating from the bench by making policy instead of staying in its lane of interpreting the laws passed by Congress. Second, Jackson noted that limiting language in Section 666 already provides fair notice of the statute’s reach, which negates the majority’s concerns about the “prosecution of the gift cards, burrito bowls, and steak dinners that derail [the] decision.”  One such limitation of the statute is that it only covers officials of entities that receive more than $10,000 per year from the federal government. Jackson noted that ""when Congress has appropriated federal money, it does not have to sit by and accept the risk of operations thwarted by local and state improbity.” Suggesting that the majority’s real concern was its hostility to federal regulation over the states, Jackson defended the federal government’s duty to safeguard federal funds. Congress had every right to enact laws, she wrote, “to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.” The statute also only applies to conduct that is committed “corruptly.” The court, she wrote, has previously defined corruptly to mean “wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil” conduct, requiring “consciousness of wrongdoing.” That language would require proof that an official not only acted wrongfully in accepting a gift, but that the official knew they were acting wrongfully. This wording should prevent the prosecution of an official who accepts a small gift as a token of appreciation, a far cry from the $13,000 reward Snyder received for delivering a $1.1 million contract. Jackson’s opinion states what should be obvious: “Officials who use their public positions for private gain threaten the integrity of our most important institutions. Greed makes governments — at every level — less responsive, less efficient, and less trustworthy from the perspective of the communities they serve.” The majority should take the hint. "
Why RFK Jr.'s campaign is peddling the idea that the government may be 'satanically possessed',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 12:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-shanahan-conspiracy-2024-election-satanic-trump-rcna159473,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy’s campaign is best known for fringe conspiracy theories tied to vaccines and other medical interventions, such as the belief that antidepressants cause school shootings. But his running mate, Silicon Valley lawyer and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan, now appears to be dabbling in a wider and, well, more fantastical range of paranoid thinking about the world. Among other things, she has proposed that she and Kennedy are not just fighting against bad policies, but against “demonic” forces — a disconcerting phenomenon, for sure. But there is a potential silver lining: The claims are also more likely to be bought by voters who might otherwise vote for former President Donald Trump. A new report in Rolling Stone lays out how Shanahan’s rhetoric about the two party-system has taken a dark turn. In her pitch to the Libertarian Party in May, she argued that Kennedy could win because he “understands the deeply troubling, almost demonic forces that have overtaken our agencies, and our culture.” The hedge with “almost” does nothing to alleviate my concern that Shanahan seems to think Washington may need a literal exorcism. And in a post on X last week, she published a list of 12 things she believes that the “uniparty hates” and “most Americans love.” (“Uniparty” is a shorthand for the idea that the Democrats and Republicans are merely two faces of the same establishment party.) The list included “democracy,” “parents raising their kids,” “humanity,” and, at No. 7, “questioning if the government might be satanically possessed.” OK! Third parties often try to run on policy ideas that neither of the two major parties have an interest in. The Green Party historically contends that neither Democrats nor Republicans do enough to take care of the environment or attend to consumer safety. Libertarians argue that neither Democrats nor Republicans are willing to adquately shrink the size of government or make tax policies fairer. Shanahan apparently thinks that neither party is willing to reckon with an evil spirit’s possession of Uncle Sam.  Shanahan’s belief that the two-party system hates “humanity” also speaks to the belief that she and Kennedy are locked in a Manichean struggle between light and darkness. Yes, we live in a very politically polarized nation, but it’s still highly unusual to hear political leaders refer to their opponents as literally diabolical. Talk of the government as devilish does not just imply a certain kind of religiosity or paranoia — it has specific political valences in contemporary American life. Rolling Stone’s Tim Dickinson writes: It would be naive to think that Shanahan is stumbling into this rhetoric by accident. Like Kennedy, she has swiftly embedded herself in the far-right media ecosystem. At a recent event Shanahan said that she and former Fox News host and conspiracy theorist extraordinaire Tucker Carlson are “on the same page in every single way.” On social media she boosted an InfoWars host who was sentenced to prison for his role in sparking the Jan. 6 insurrection. Regardless of where Shanahan's privately held beliefs lie, there is no reason to assume she doesn’t know exactly what she’s tapping into with this speech.  Considering that Kennedy is consistently garnering around 10% in national polls, it’s unpleasant to contemplate how his campaign is potentially further mainstreaming QAnon conspiracy theories and corroding our social fabric. It is not good for influential political leaders to encourage people to believe that the mainstream political class can’t be trusted because it is hostage to satanic forces. It limits the possibility for dialogue across political boundaries; it’s one thing to be cynical about the ability of the government to get things done; it’s another thing to think that it compromised by the devil. This strain of mistrust can also intensify the likelihood of extremist violence, such as when a man fired a gun in Comet Pizza in Washington, D.C., in 2016 based on disinformation that it served as the base for a satanic child sex abuse ring. But if this kind of rhetoric continues and intensifies, it could be good news for Biden. Believers in theories of a demonic cabal in the government skew to the right, and it’s possible that voters who otherwise might be part of Trump’s base defect to Kennedy. In a narrow race, that could make a difference for Biden in some key states. "
Taraji P. Henson made Project 2025 the talk of the BET Awards,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 11:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/bet-awards-taraji-henson-project-2025-rcna159770,"Project 2025, the draconian plan supported by conservative groups to dismantle the government if Donald Trump is elected in November, was the talk of the Black Entertainment Television Awards on Sunday. The plan, which includes everything from rolling back civil rights legislation to restricting contraception and abortion access, would effectively place the United States under authoritarian Christian nationalist rule and purge people from the government if they’re seen as disloyal to Trump. And despite all its horrors, recent reports suggest many people still don’t know about the plan.  So it was noteworthy that Project 2025 and its role in the conservative movement’s plans to unravel civil rights protections received ample attention Sunday. Host Taraji P. Henson made multiple references to it. One came at the show's end when she encouraged viewers to research it, and another came during a midshow public service announcement. She said: Henson went on to reference Project 2025's proposals to require mandatory national service, which could include compulsory military service and has many people concerned about the reinstitution of the draft. She also talked about the potential for the next president to seat three Supreme Court justices. ""We need those seats, or we have no protection,"" she warned. During the show, she appeared in an ad with Vice President Kamala Harris, in which the two Howard University alums discussed the election and the civil rights at stake. The ad didn't explicitly mention Project 2025, but it did address the democratic principles — like bodily autonomy and voting rights — threatened by it. These kinds of messages struck me as significant. I’ve written at length about celebrities and pop culture figures using their platforms to promote Trump and his fascistic MAGA movement. It was promising to see the BET Awards effectively used to do the opposite — at least when Henson was onstage. Henson's messaging — and more like it — may go a long way in closing the existing information gap for many voters and Project 2025. Her words rang especially true Monday, when the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Trump's federal election interference case deeming presidents partially immune from prosecution over a wide range of actions. If Trump is elected and Project 2025 is put into action under these terms, Americans will all be living under an imperial presidency — authoritarian rule with no guaranteed end."
The fascinating defense theory in Karen Read’s murder trial,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"June 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 1, 2024, 11:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/karen-read-trial-jury-verdict-defense-rcna159344,"UPDATE (July 1, 2024, 2:50 p.m. ET): On Monday afternoon, Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial after the jury was not able to reach a verdict. My job is to follow legal stories in the news. Apparently, I’m not so great at my job. A month ago, when a nonjournalist friend messaged me to ask about my thoughts on the Karen Read murder trial. My response was: “Who’s Karen Read?” I didn’t know what they were talking about. Weeks later, and after many messages from other friends, I know who Karen Read is. I can’t avoid knowing who Karen Read is. This feels like the rare trial that has transcended the already-popular true crime realm and launched into the mainstream.  And as a Boston jury continues its dayslong deliberations, speculation is rampant. On Friday, the jury said it was struggling to reach a verdict. The judge told them to keep trying. And so we wait. Karen Read is a 44-year-old finance professor in Massachusetts accused of intentionally backing her Lexus SUV into her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer, and leaving him to die, unconscious outside a house party in a blizzard. There was damage to her vehicle, and Read allegedly made a number of incriminating statements at the scene of the crime, including: “I hit him. I hit him. Oh my God. I hit him.” Case closed, right? The prosecution’s case seemed pretty straightforward: a classic lovers’ quarrel turned deadly. Or maybe another common scenario: drunken-driver-didn’t-realize-she-had-hit-someone. So at first I didn’t understand why this case had sparked so much interest. Prosecutors had evidence of damage to the back of Read’s vehicle, evidence she was driving drunk, evidence that she had a “rough” relationship with the victim, expletive-laced voicemails from Read to the victim’s phone, and what seemed to be voluntary admissions by the defendant that she had hit the victim. But that was before I dug into the evidence, watched closing arguments and immersed myself in the defense’s theory of the case. Now, if I were on the jury, I’d vote not guilty.  I want to be clear here: I’m not so sure Read is innocent. Instead, I think there’s reasonable doubt of her guilt. And that means she’s not guilty. Read’s defense team has pulled off a rare miracle in criminal defense: They have constructed an alternate theory of police cover-up that actually has some evidence to support it. The defense doesn’t need to put out an alternate theory of the case. They have no obligation to prove someone else committed the crime. The defense has no burden. They can rest and just argue that the prosecution didn’t meet their own burden to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. But ideally, the defense would want an alternate theory of the case, so jurors have something to believe in. Jurors like to feel that they solved a mystery. But putting forward an alternate theory is much harder than simply pointing at flaws in the prosecution, or claiming “some other dude did it” (the “SODDI” defense). What Read’s defense did is even more difficult. Her lawyers are claiming the police did it — that the “other dude” in this case is law enforcement, framing their client.  Criminal defense attorneys will tell you, in moments of candor, that their clients often want to pursue this sort of defense. (“The cops planted those drugs on me!”) But most of the time, there’s no actual hard evidence of police planting evidence or a cover-up, and defense counsel wisely declines this strategy. But “the frame” can work. The O.J. Simpson defense team tried this tactic. It was a bold move. But the defense team pulled it off, despite the seemingly overwhelming evidence of Simpson’s guilt. Read’s defense team has done a similarly magnificent job of uncovering critical inconsistencies, and sloppy police work. They employed top expert witnesses. They crunched the data. The defense used the health app on victim O’Keefe’s phone to suggest that he went downstairs into the basement at the house party — despite the prosecution, and the party hosts, arguing he never made it inside. Read’s lawyers developed a theory that Read did drop off O’Keefe at the party, after which O’Keefe got into a fight with someone and was attacked by the family dog. Read’s defense brought in experts to say O’Keefe’s wounds were consistent with a dog bite, from a dog the size of the one in the house, who had a history of biting people. And, even if the police didn’t engage in a cover-up, they seemed to engage in questionable behavior. The lead investigator texted inappropriate comments about Read to others. Three different prosecution witnesses testified that at critical times, including the night of the killing, their calls back and forth to each other were inadvertent “butt dials.” But the “butt dial” itself is an anachronism. Phones don’t have buttons anymore that call people when you sit on them. It’s not a believable explanation for some suspicious phone calls. Certainly, the defense theory still has some holes in it. The most notable is why the police would engage in such a sophisticated cover-up, requiring a number of co-conspirators, but just leave the victim’s body outside of the house where the true crime was committed. Police officers should know better than anyone: If you’re going to “dump” a body somewhere, the worst place to do it is in your own front yard. Even as a criminal defense attorney myself, I find that I am frequently skeptical of defense theories. It’s fair to say that a lot of the time, the prosecution has put the right guy in the defendant’s chair. But I also know that police can be lazy, sloppy and, at their worst, willing to bend the truth to protect themselves and each other. In this case, I think the evidence at the very least suggests some degree of police self-interest and dishonesty. Most of this supposed cover-up required a lot of things to go right — not just the night of O’Keefe’s killing, but in the days that followed. The defense suggests that in the moments after an alleged fight, with a grievously wounded but still-alive victim, the best plan this group of friends could come up with was to just throw the man onto the house’s lawn. Sure, people make stupid decisions when they are drunk and panicked, but that’s a terrible plan. The prosecution pointed this out during their closing, while methodically marching through a lot of damning evidence against the defendant — much of it coming from the defendant’s mouth herself.  And still, I wouldn’t vote “innocent.” But I’d vote “not guilty.”"
Trump and Rubio try — and fail — to defend ‘Black jobs’ comment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-rubio-black-jobs-presidential-debate-rcna159765,"Quick observation from over the weekend: If our country’s pundit class weren’t overwhelmingly white, the framing of Thursday’s debate would have revolved around Donald Trump’s overt racism and not Joe Biden’s speech pattern. Because Trump’s false and bigoted claim about immigrants taking “Black jobs” instantly sparked widespread backlash — and it has arguably been the most talked about moment from the debate. Trump and his campaign have sought to pit Black people against immigrants (despite some Black people being immigrants themselves) to promote xenophobia, in hopes of aiding his election. His “Black jobs” claim was a tortured attempt to do that, despite the Black unemployment rate reaching a record low under the Biden administration. And, for the record, experts have since done what CNN failed to do during the debate itself: debunk Trump’s claim. So it’s remarkable that Team Trump is doubling down on the claim. Sen. Marco Rubio, who has effectively taken it upon himself to be Trump’s racism translator, tried to clean up the comments in the spin room on debate night. It didn’t go well. “When you flood a country with millions of people,” the Florida Republican claimed, “you’re going to have more competition for work. You are. And those workers are willing to do it at a lower wage.” Here, Rubio used racist and dehumanizing language to suggest that “Black jobs” are ... low-wage jobs. As an example, he mentioned construction jobs. I feel confident saying the majority of Black folks aren’t eager to work what are often backbreaking construction jobs, but that’s almost beside the point, which is that the senator is simply wrong. Evidence shows that immigrants actually drive job creation. Nonetheless, Trump repeated the claim himself at a rally in Virginia on Saturday, saying immigration is “the worst thing that’s happening” to Black people because immigrants are “taking the Black jobs.” Trump is taking one of the ugliest lines from his debate and turning it into a mantra."
The courts are not going to protect us,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 11:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sotomayor-trump-immunity-dissent-election-rcna159769,"Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent in the Trump immunity ruling contained language unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Supreme Court opinion: What Sotomayor is signaling here is that it’s not just about the Trump Jan. 6 case. It’s about every president going forward, indeed possibly Trump next year, and being immune from criminal law — to be able to use the Justice Department in ways the court today calls ""absolutely immune"" to undermine elections, to go after individuals. This is as grave a shift in our constitutional system as any in our lifetime. If you ever thought about the stakes in November and what they were, this opinion makes them very clear. The stakes are now astronomical in a way they might not have been before. You have to have someone in power you can trust to execute the laws faithfully and to comply with the Constitution. But after this ruling, it's clear the law and the courts are not going to be a check against the next president. This is a clarion call for the American public to understand the courts are not going to protect us against a president who wants to violate the law. This is an adapted excerpt from the July 1 episode of Ana Cabera Reports."
