0,Kamala Harris practically dares Trump to debate her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 12:56:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-debate-september-rcna164521,"Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, once again challenged Donald Trump to debate her, telling a roaring crowd in Atlanta on Tuesday night that he was feeling the pressure of running against her in November. ""So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it — you may have noticed,"" the vice president said at a campaign rally, as she pointed to Trump's refusal to commit to a debate in September. “He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.” “Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” Harris said. “Because as the saying goes, 'if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.'” Harris' remarks seem designed to taunt Trump into debating her. The vice president has been engaged in a back-and-forth with the Trump campaign as it dithers the GOP nominee's participation in a previously agreed-upon Sept. 10 debate, which it arranged with Joe Biden's re-election campaign before he withdrew from the race. On Thursday, Harris accused the Trump campaign of “backpedaling” on the scheduled debate, saying, “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.” Trump's campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, later said it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.” The calculations for the Trump campaign have shifted dramatically since Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. Trump had previously challenged Biden to debate “anytime, anywhere, any place,” and the fallout of Biden’s disastrous showing at the June 27 debate also overshadowed his own blathering performance. Now, as his campaign tries to reorient its strategy for Harris, Trump, whose debate style is rich on insults and poor on substance, now faces the daunting prospect of taking on a former prosecutor known for her debate punches on live television. In an interview with Fox News this week, Trump himself waffled on the subject. He suggested there was no point debating Harris because “everybody knows who I am, and now people know who she is.” He then said he would “probably” debate Harris, but added that he “can also make a case for not doing it.”"
1,Harris' historic campaign builds on breakthroughs by other Black women,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 12:15:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-historic-moseley-braun-2024-rcna164343,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""The Beat."" It was a whirlwind first week for Vice President Kamala Harris’ historic presidential campaign. The Guardian described her candidacy as a generational shift in U.S. politics.  Harris, of course, is no stranger to breaking barriers — she’s serving as the first woman vice president in our country’s history — but she's drawn from a range of trailblazers who laid the groundwork for this moment.  Geraldine Ferraro, a Democrat, became the first female vice presidential candidate on a major U.S. party ticket in 1984. There's also former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican Party's first female candidate for vice president. In 2016, Hillary Clinton shattered the glass ceiling when she won the Democratic presidential nomination. Shirley Chisholm was both the first Black woman elected to Congress and the first to run for president. Chisholm pushed her party, which has since come to rely heavily on Black voters, to take Black leadership seriously. Before ascending to the highest echelon of the Democratic Party, Harris was the only Black woman in the Senate. There was only one Black female senator who served before her. That senator was Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, sworn into the Senate in 1993. Moseley Braun, who ran on a platform of women’s and civil rights, immediately challenged the status quo in Washington. In her first year in office, she defiantly took to the Senate floor to protest the renewal of a congressional patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, whose insignia featured the Confederate flag. “I’ve got to tell you, this vote is about race. It is about racial symbolism. … It is about our racial past and the single most painful episode in American history,” Moseley Braun told her colleagues.  Moseley Braun also challenged sexism in the Senate. She was among the first to buck the unofficial ban on women wearing pants on the Senate floor. Moseley Braun wore them repeatedly until the rule was changed. The feminist publication Ms. described that action as a “rebellion” and “a seismographic event.” On Monday’s episode of “The Beat,” I spoke with the former senator about Harris’ historic candidacy. Moseley Braun told me she was “over the moon” and “strongly supporting” the vice president. She also pledged to do everything in her power to help Harris make history yet again: “We have 98 more days to the election itself. We all have to show up and be there for her, take advantage and not let this enthusiasm dwindle. People have short memories sometimes. But if we can keep the drumbeat going, we can have our first woman president.”  Join Ari Melber, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

2,"Trump pushes his luck with new attack on Harris, China and Russia",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 07:49:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pushes-luck-new-attack-harris-china-russia-election-2024-rcna164482,"In her first week as an unexpected presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris confronted plenty of racist and sexist lines of attack, but as a Washington Post report makes clear, Donald Trump added to this record in an especially ugly way in his latest Fox News interview. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham started to ask the GOP candidate how international leaders would consider a Harris presidency, but before she could even finish asking, Trump interjected. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy. They look at her and they say, ‘We can’t believe we got so lucky.’” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Post the Republican nominee wasn’t referring to race or gender, and if you believe that, I have a lovely Trump University seminar I’d love to sell you. The obvious problem with the former president’s comments was that they were overtly offensive in ways even he should be able to understand. But there are plenty of less obvious problems, too. For one thing, Harris has spent the last four years in national office, meeting with international officials and leaving no doubt that she’s a force to be reckoned with. For another, if Trump is so convinced that international leaders will walk all over the Democrat, perhaps he could explain why he’s so afraid to share a debate stage with her. But perhaps most important is the degree to which Trump keeps failing tests of self-awareness. Indeed, if he’s looking for an American leader who wasn’t taken seriously abroad, Trump probably ought to find a mirror. In 2018, for example, he addressed the United Nations general assembly, where foreign diplomats literally laughed at him. China’s state-run media routinely characterized Trump — during his presidency — as a bumbling fool who had a habit of slapping himself in the face. Even U.S. allies quietly conceded that they perceived the then-president as an intemperate child with a short attention span. Let's also not forget about a 2019 international gathering in which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the U.K.'s Boris Johnson were overheard mocking Trump, treating him like a punch-line to a joke they found rather exasperating. Russia’s Vladimir Putin was more reluctant to ridicule Trump in public, but that’s only because he enjoyed walking all over the Republican and didn’t feel the need to put that advantage at risk. All of which is to say, Trump’s latest line of attack isn’t just ugly, and it isn’t just wrong. It’s also the latest example of the former president engaging in projection."
3,"The problem(s) with Trump’s ugly rhetoric about Harris, antisemitism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-31 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-ugly-rhetoric-harris-antisemitism-jewish-election-2024-rcna164448,"Donald Trump seems determined to convince voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is antisemitic. She’s not, and the former president’s attacks are as ugly as they are false, but the Republican appears preoccupied with pushing this line anyway. During a speech last week, for example, the GOP nominee falsely said his likely Democratic rival is “totally against the Jewish people” — a curious claim about someone who’s married to a Jewish person — and as the Associated Press reported, Trump went even further yesterday. The former president seemed quite worked up on the issue, ranting that Harris dislikes both Israel and Jews — it’s something “everybody knows,” Trump said, reality notwithstanding — while adding that Jewish voters are “fools” to vote Democratic. The radio host, Sid Rosenberg, proceeded to say that Harris’ Jewish husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is “a crappy Jew” and “a horrible Jew.” And while Trump didn’t use those words himself, as an audio clip makes clear, he seemed to agree with the condemnations. A Politico report described the comments as ""bizarre."" A press statement from the Harris campaign, not surprisingly, went much further, describing the on-air exchange as “disgusting” and adding, “America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump.” At this point, we could spend a few paragraphs talking about how wrong the Republican’s attack is. We could also highlight the fact that Trump hasn’t even tried to substantiate his absurdities with evidence. But as important as those points are, I’m struck by a larger point: Trump apparently believes he has credibility when it comes to antisemitism, but he really doesn’t. As regular readers might recall, it was just four months ago, for example, when the GOP nominee invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel. To put it mildly, Jewish Democrats in Congress were not impressed. An Axios report quoted Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, for example, saying, “Trump demonstrates daily his lack of fitness for the presidency by spreading dangerous stereotypes and embracing antisemites.” Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina added that the former president’s rhetoric is “particularly disgraceful and dangerous at a time when Jews are facing dangerous levels of antisemitism nationwide.” Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland issued an especially pointed response, noting, “Luckily I don’t know any Jews who look to Donald Trump for advice on how to be Jewish. After all, this is the guy who saw ‘very fine people on both sides’ of an antisemitic riot and entertained the neo-Nazi Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes over at his house at Mar-a-Lago for dinner.” That larger pattern was of particular interest. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, “You’re not gonna support me because I don’t want your money. You want to control your politicians.” He added, “I’m a negotiator — like you folks.” Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met “in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.” While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their “loyalties.” Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council’s national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign. There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters “don’t love Israel enough,” dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago and arguing that Jews need to “get their act together” and “appreciate” Israel “before it is too late.” In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders “should be ashamed of themselves” over their “lack of loyalty.” Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker. In his earlier campaigns, Trump has struggled badly with Jewish voters. If he thinks lying about Harris will change that, the Republican probably ought to lower his expectations.

4,Beyoncé's 'Freedom' becomes the soundtrack to Kamala Harris' historic campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 09:41:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599,"In the days since Vice President Kamala Harris launched her bid for president, Beyoncé’s song “Freedom” has become the soundtrack to her campaign. Harris walked out to the song at her first visit to her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. It played the next day at her first campaign rally in Wisconsin. On Thursday, the campaign released its first ad, which again featured the song. The video contrasts Donald Trump's vision for the country with hers, with Harris saying in a voiceover: “There are some people who think that we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate. But us? We choose something different: We choose freedom.” Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which features rapper Kendrick Lamar, was released in 2016 as part of her visual album “Lemonade.” Rolling Stone called the song at the time “one of the most striking political statements” of Beyoncé’s career. Although the Grammy Award-winning artist has not officially endorsed any candidate in this year's race, she did grant Harris’ campaign permission to use the song through the next few months of the election, CNN reported on Monday. (That Harris is using the music with the artist's permission also stands in stark contrast to Trump, who's been asked not to play songs by the Rolling Stones, R.E.M., Prince, Neil Young, Rihanna, Guns N' Roses, Queen and Adele — among others.) Harris is a known Beyoncé fan. She and her husband, Doug Emhoff, went to the singer’s Renaissance World Tour concert in Maryland last August. The tickets, valued at $1,655.92, were a gift from Beyoncé, according to Harris’ financial disclosure report earlier this year. Beyoncé has a history of supporting Democratic candidates. She sang the National Anthem at President Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration and performed at a concert for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign alongside her husband, Jay-Z — much to Donald Trump's consternation, even years later. Beyoncé also endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020."
5,"Trump says Harris shouldn’t be ‘allowed to run,’ recycling weird claim",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-harris-shouldnt-allowed-run-recycling-weird-claim-rcna163593,"In his first rally since President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race, Donald Trump did exactly what everyone expected him to do: The Republican spent much of the event going after Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president’s case against his new rival, however, has tended to rely heavily on vague name-calling: Trump called the likely Democratic nominee a “lunatic,” for example. But during his pitch in North Carolina, one the GOP nominee’s lines of attack stood out: The Republican’s followers, naturally, cheered the rhetoric. There is a degree of irony to the comments: A jury recently found Trump guilty of nearly three dozen felonies. If Harris “shouldn’t even be allowed to run for president” because “she’s committing crimes,” then I supposed we should look forward to the former president delivering a withdrawal speech of his own. What’s more, insisting that the Democratic vice president is “committing crimes” would be less ridiculous if Trump had any evidence of Harris, you know, actually committing crimes. But of particular interest was the GOP candidate’s suggestion that his likely Democratic rival “shouldn’t even be allowed to run” for the White House. If the comment rang a bell, there’s a good reason for that: Part of the problem here is that the Republican nominee is getting lazy, recycling stale insults, nicknames and attacks. But just as notable is the fact that Trump has long taken a keen interest in who should and shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him, and in a remarkable coincidence, he consistently argues that those who stand in his way are — or should be — ineligible for American ballots. Trump already earned a reputation as someone who was hostile toward democracy. This won’t help. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
6,Trump voters fear 'excitement' of Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-25 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/wisconsin-voters-swing-state-trump-harris-2024-rcna163528,"On Tuesday, Elise Jordan, an MSNBC political analyst and former George W. Bush administration staffer, sat down with voters in the battleground state of Wisconsin. The Badger State has played a pivotal role in deciding the last two presidential elections. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, defeating Hillary Clinton by almost 23,000 votes. In 2020, Joe Biden turned the state back to blue, beating Trump by a similar margin. Ahead of the 2024 election, Jordan spoke with two voting blocs that could help move the margin in either candidate's direction: female Trump supporters and right-leaning swing voters. Jordan, who was just in Wisconsin last month conducting similar focus groups, said she was shocked at the burst of energy Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy had injected into the race — among both Trump supporters and swing voters. The group of Trump supporters told Jordan they feared the Democratic ticket shake-up could lower Trump’s chances of retaking the White House, since they believe Harris could motivate young, minority and female voters to head to the polls. “Everyone is excited about her, and that scares me,"" one voter shared. Asked how they view Harris’ competence and experience compared to Biden, voters said they saw the vice president as worse. One woman called out Harris for her role in the administration's immigration policy: ""She doesn't even know what's going on at the border, and that's what she was supposed to be in charge of? I mean, as a schoolteacher, if I didn't do what I was supposed to be doing, you better believe my job would be in jeopardy."" Another voter took aim at Harris' intelligence, calling her an ""idiot"" and ""not real smart."" The voters also expressed doubt over the possible election outcome. Asked whether a Harris victory in November would be an ""honest result,"" the entire group shook their heads at Jordan. As for right-leaning swing voters, the group said they had concerns about both Harris and Trump. One voter told Jordan she was open to voting for Harris but felt ""uneasy"" over how much the vice president may have known about Biden's mental and physical fitness. She said if Harris was ""willing to hide that type of information"" about Biden, ""what she’s willing to hide for herself?” As for their views of the former president, a voter told Jordan she couldn't ignore Trump's criminal convictions. She also had issues with his integrity and moral character, suggesting Trump could use the office to ""retaliate"" against his enemies. Another voter voiced shared concern over Trump’s “making too aggressive of choices” and acting out of impulse. However, she also worried Harris could be too cautious in responding to threats and make the U.S. appear ""weak."" One swing voter had a message for both candidates: “It would just be nice if they concentrate more on the issues instead of the mudslinging and personal attacks. ... Let’s try to find that common ground where we can agree on things. Let’s start with that.”"
7,The Secret Service failed Trump. They can’t fail Harris too.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 14:57:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/secret-service-president-assassination-trump-harris-rcna163421,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 23 episode of ""The Last Word."" With just over 100 days until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris spent her first day as the presumptive nominee for president of the Democratic Party on the campaign trail in the crucial electoral college state of Wisconsin. Harris’ Secret Service detail, which was already very strong, should now be strengthened  — not just because she has moved up from vice presidential nominee to presidential nominee, but because we have seen recent proof of Secret Service protection not being strong enough. The director of the Secret Service resigned Tuesday after being sharply questioned by both Democrats and Republicans in a congressional hearing about how a lone gunman was allowed to get on a roof within range of a presidential candidate and fire shots that could have killed the candidate and did kill one of the spectators and wounded two others. That is the first time in history that a Secret Service director has resigned after shots were fired, even though every single time shots have been fired at a president since the creation of the Secret Service, after Abraham Lincoln’s presidency, it has always been the Secret Service’s fault. Every time.  In every single shooting, the Secret Service made the mistake of giving the shooters a clear shot. In 1901, the Secret Service allowed an assassin to walk right up to President William McKinley to shake his hand and instead revealed a handgun shooting the president to death. Congress had no hard questions for Secret Service Director John Wilkie after that, and the Secret Service director served another 10 years in that job after failing to protect the life of President McKinley. In 1933, two weeks before his inauguration, an assassin approached President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s car in Florida and fired shots that missed him but killed a mayor who was standing on the running board of the president-elect’s car. Once again, the Secret Service let an assassin with a gun get too close to the president-elect. Roosevelt was riding in an open car. It was an easy shot because it was an open car. The world was lucky that the assassin missed. Congress did not grill Secret Service Director William Moran who allowed that assassin to get so close to the president. Congress did not ask why Moran allowed the president-elect to ride in an open car. Moran served three more years as Secret Service director and continued to allow Roosevelt to ride fully exposed in an open car, which Roosevelt did throughout his presidency. Thirty years after those shots were fired at Roosevelt, shots fired at President John Fitzgerald Kennedy riding in the back of an open car took the life of the youngest president in history. As pieces of the president’s skull and brain tissue fell onto the surface of the open car behind President Kennedy’s head, his wife tried to reach back to grab those pieces while the fully incompetent Secret Service began climbing onto the back of the limousine and urging the first lady to stay in the car.       It was only after Kennedy was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, that afternoon that Secret Service Director James Rowley decided the president should never again ride in an open car. And no president ever has, since that day. If Rowley had made that decision one day before, American history would be so much less tragic. Rowley served 10 more years as Secret Service director after losing Kennedy on his watch because of his incompetence. Kennedy’s younger brother Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 while running for president.  The Secret Service provided protection to presidential candidates starting the day after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Bobby Kennedy’s assassin was able to walk up to him and shoot him point blank.  In 1975, the Secret Service allowed President Gerald Ford to be shot at twice within two weeks. Stuart Knight was the director of the Secret Service then. He allowed people with no firearms training to simply get too close to the president.  He’s the only Secret Service director in history who allowed the same president to be shot at twice. But he wasn’t finished. He became the only Secret Service director in history to allow two different presidents to be shot at.  He was in charge when the Secret Service allowed another completely untrained pedestrian with a handgun to walk up and get close enough to President Ronald Reagan to fire shots as the president was entering the Washington Hilton. In that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed the president’s press secretary to be shot. And in that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed a Secret Service agent to be shot. All because the Secret Service and Secret Service directors had not yet figured out how to prevent pedestrians from randomly walking up to presidents and firing handguns at them.  There was no condemnation of Knight after the Gerald Ford shootings — two in one month — or the Ronald Reagan shooting. He left the Secret Service after eight years as director.  The Secret Service got marginally better after some of these shootings. No more open cars. No more people allowed to get close to a president moving on foot in or out of a building.  And now the Secret Service thinks it has figured out how to protect Donald Trump at his rallies. The Washington Post reports that the Secret Service urged the Trump campaign to “stop scheduling large outdoor rallies and other outdoor events with big crowds.”  But at the outdoor rally in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to do the elementary thing of securing every possible elevated firing position. The roof it decided not to secure was the roof the murderer used to fire at the candidate and his supporters. It was, as usual, the Secret Service’s fault. The Secret Service director was right to resign, but she should not have been the first to resign. The new acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, is a 24-year veteran of the Secret Service. We can only hope that he will provide the protection that allows this campaign to make it to Election Day with all of the big surprises being only political surprises.

8,"Mike Johnson insists Kamala Harris’ race and gender are irrelevant, as Republicans keep calling her a ‘DEI hire’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 12:53:00,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republicans-kamala-harris-dei-hire-race-gender-rcna163484,"As the ugly attacks on Kamala Harris from the right take shape, House GOP leaders are warning their fellow Republicans not to focus on her race or gender in their criticism of the de facto Democratic presidential nominee. The racist and misogynistic attacks on the vice president from conservative commentators and GOP lawmakers began almost immediately after she announced that she will seek her party’s nomination. Some lawmakers have called her a “DEI hire,” suggesting that Harris — who has served as a U.S. senator, a California attorney general and a San Francisco district attorney — is where she is due to identity politics and not because of her accomplishments. It appears that the top brass in the House GOP are trying to steer members of their party away from such bigoted attacks. At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, urged his party members to instead focus on Harris’ record with the Biden administration, Politico reported. Afterward, House Speaker Mike Johnson told Politico that this election “has nothing to do with race” and that it’s a comparison between the two candidates’ strengths and their ideas for how to solve the country’s problems. “This election will be about policies and not personalities,” the Louisiana Republican told reporters after the meeting, according to The Associated Press. “This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris, and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.” Whether such calls will sink in among House Republicans remains to be seen — they certainly do not seem to have gotten through to their presidential nominee. According to NBC News, while on a call hosted by the Republican National Committee on Tuesday, Donald Trump accused Harris of having “played the race card on a level you rarely see” in debates with Joe Biden during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2020."
9,Republicans’ case against Kamala Harris is off to an ugly start,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 10:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-election-republicans-case-kamala-harris-ugly-start-rcna163468,"Three days into the transformed 2024 presidential race, how is the Republican Party’s case against Vice President Kamala Harris coming along? While pondering the question, consider the headline on one of The Associated Press’ overnight reports: “Republican leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris.” From the article: On the one hand, Republican officials believe this will be the year in which they break through with voters in communities of color. On the other hand, GOP leaders feel the need to remind their members that targeting Harris with racism isn’t a good idea. That said, the reminders have merit. A political sprint is obviously underway — Election Day is just over 100 days away — and it stands to reason that Republicans are going to take on the likely Democratic nominee in every possible way. But it’s also hard not to notice that the GOP’s case against the incumbent vice president is off to a rough start. Over the course of the last 72 hours, the American public has seen Republicans target Harris with: • racism; • sexism; • false claims about her serving as a “border czar”; • complaints about her laugh; • complaints that she has served the public for too many years; • complaints about her hometown of San Francisco; • complaints that she likes Venn diagrams too much; and • complaints about plastic straws. For good measure, let’s not overlook the fact that Republican Sen. JD Vance — a year before getting elected to Congress, and two years before receiving his party’s vice presidential nomination — took rhetorical aim at Harris during a Fox News appearance, emphasizing the fact that she does not have biological children of her own. As part of his Senate campaign in Ohio, Vance specifically referred to Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” The Republican added that this included Harris. The GOP will need a winning message against the likely Democratic nominee. This isn’t it."
10,Dems in array: Handoff from Biden to Harris appears seamless,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 08:22:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-2024-democrats-array-handoff-biden-harris-appears-seamless-rcna163430,"Ahead of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race, many of the Democratic incumbent’s supporters said he had to keep going with his re-election bid — because the alternative would be intraparty chaos, division and disarray. There was one important flaw, however, in the argument: Democrats were already dealing with intraparty chaos, division and disarray. Nearly every day, more party officials called on the president to pass the torch, and there were multiple polls showing most rank-and-file Democratic voters as wanting an alternative to Biden. It appeared unsustainable. It also appears that the party has turned a corner. A Wall Street Journal report summarized: With extraordinary speed, a party that appeared fractured is suddenly united. A party that saw its fundraising efforts screeching to a halt is suddenly reporting record-breaking hauls. A party that cringed in response to every new poll is celebrating the latest national survey data. This seamless handoff from Biden to Harris wasn’t inevitable, but it has been executed with striking skill. It prompted Matt Compton, a veteran of the Obama White House, to note via social media: “Shout out to the staffers in Delaware who just lived through the most stressful five weeks in campaign history, then flipped every piece of branding and content on a dime, raised $100m, recruited 58,000 volunteers, and generally just lit the internet on fire for Kamala Harris.” Pod Save America’s Dan Pfeiffer added, ""What [the Harris campaign team] has pulled of since Sunday is truly incredible. No campaign in history has ever undergone such a shift with no notice. The way they been able to capture the wave of enthusiasm is so impressive. True professionals."" That’s certainly fair, though it’s also worth pausing to emphasize Biden’s role. The incumbent president didn’t just do the bold thing by standing aside, he also played a direct role in helping rally Democrats behind their likely new nominee. The results have been unmistakably impressive."
11,"Kamala Harris sounds different, but she could still be a status quo president on Israel",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 06:58:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-israel-netanyahu-gaza-rcna163202,"President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his bid for re-election has sparked curiosity and hope among progressives and Arab Americans who were turned off by his support for and complicity in Israel’s brutal siege of the Gaza Strip. Many are wondering whether Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner to win the Democratic presidential nomination, may be more inclined than her boss to push back more forcefully against Israel and offer support to Palestinians. It’s a tricky assessment to make, in no small part because Harris doesn’t have a deep background in foreign policy. Most of Harris’ career focused on law enforcement, and during her brief stint in the Senate she wasn’t a major foreign policy player. Her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign focused mostly on buzzy domestic policy ideas. As vice president she did delve into foreign affairs and diplomacy, but her job wasn’t to craft major policy — it was to execute it. There are some small hints that Harris could be to the left of Biden on the issue. But there are also plenty of reasons to think she would approach the issue similarly to him, and that her divergence from Biden could come down to speech style rather than policy.  The case for Harris as being potentially more sympathetic to Palestinian interests is primarily based on subtle rhetorical signals. In March, Harris delivered a speech that included some of the most overtly critical statements about Israel’s operation issued by the Biden administration, acknowledging the situation in Gaza as a “catastrophe.” Moreover, that speech might have been even more pointed had it not been softened by her colleagues. NBC News, citing current and former officials, reported that “the original draft of her remarks was harsher on Israel in describing the dire humanitarian situation for Palestinians in Gaza and the need for more aid.” White House National Security Council officials reportedly “toned down” parts of her speech. (A Harris spokesperson at the time called the portrayal ""inaccurate."") Later that month Harris said in an interview that she didn’t rule out “consequences” for Israel if it launched an invasion of Rafah, which was at the time a stronger warning to Israel than any Biden official had made to date. As Politico reported at the time, Harris “has consistently gone further than President Joe Biden by at least half a step” in her rhetoric criticizing Israel. And in an interview with The Nation, Harris at least came across as more specifically attentive to the suffering of Gazans — and U.S. protesters on their behalf — than Biden. However, Harris’ criticisms of Israel, while notable, have been modest in scope, and might appear stronger than they are because Biden has set such a low bar. As independent journalist Spencer Ackerman has pointed out, in her March speech, Harris might have sounded more upset by the humanitarian horror show than Biden, but she refused to condemn or fully critique Israel’s policy that helped give rise to it: the collective punishment of Gaza by vastly restricting food, electricity and supplies in violation of international law. Harris' Nation interview might have sounded humane, but she made no substantive policy statements and declined to clarify which, if any, protesters she felt were right. And Harris’ saying Israel might face “consequences” over Rafah was not a red line comment, and hardly guarantees that she has the resolve to confront Israel in a meaningful manner.  From the beginning of Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 war crimes, the Biden administration has hinted that it could do something but has basically done nothing significant about it beyond private pressure — with the exception of a temporary pause on a shipment of some of the heaviest ordinance it sends to Israel. The more one digs into Harris’ background, the case that she could be an agent of the status quo on Israel appears meatier than the case against. Her rhetoric on Israel has generally ticked all the conventional U.S. foreign policy establishment boxes, including emphasizing the “ironclad” nature of the U.S.-Israeli alliance and Israel’s right to defend itself. As a senator, she spoke twice at conferences held by the hawkish American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), pledged support for Israel’s security and described the bond between the U.S. and Israel as “unbreakable.” During her first AIPAC speech in 2017, she noted that her first act as a senator was to introduce a resolution condemning a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel. Jeremy Scahill of Drop Site News recently wrote up a comprehensive evaluation of Harris’ policy record on Israel and described her as having “hardline” support for Israel, noting, among many other things, her co-sponsoring legislation in 2017 “condemning former President Barack Obama’s decision to abstain from vetoing a UN Security Council Resolution critical of Israel.” In addition to Harris’ conventional pro-Israel positioning, her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, is reportedly likely to remain central to her foreign policy agenda. He is a longtime U.S. foreign policy establishment adviser, who seemingly aligns with a number of Biden’s views of Middle East policy. When you put all this together, the picture emerges of a politician who, at least after Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks, has a rhetorical tendency slightly to the left of Biden. But most of her public positions don’t suggest that she is ready to change the course of the U.S.-Israeli relationship in a substantial way, if at all. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a seasoned former Middle East hand, summed up his assessment this way in a recent interview with NBC News: Her views on Israel are to the “left of what Biden is prepared to do but way to the right of those who argue we need to impose costs and consequences on Israel to make it clear we’re the superpower and they’re not.” Miller's synopsis is a reminder that Harris' rhetoric could cut both ways: it could signal openness to new directions, but it could also provide cover for business as usual. The one major X factor of Harris’ worldview is she is still a relative newbie in the world of foreign policy. Her worldview is still forming, and the world is changing. It is possible that Harris’ perception of Israeli policy — like many Americans’ — was changed by Hamas’ attacks or Israel’s response to them. While newness can make some politicians more conservative, still others might feel emboldened to shake up the status quo. Harris’ newness might, theoretically, make her more more receptive to left-wing pressure on the issue. That activism is already taking place — such as a recent statement by major unions calling on the U.S. to halt military aid to Israel. Some of it is likely to be on the way — such as widely anticipated pro-Palestinian protests at the Democratic National Convention. A sustained resurgence of effective pro-Palestinian protests could extract policy wins from Harris, whether on the campaign trail or during a potential presidency. Harris will most likely try to use use ambiguity and a light touch to work to her advantage. Without doing much, she can allow many progressives to project hope onto her as an alternative to the status quo. And without doing much, she can bank on most pro-Israel supporters of the Democratic Party, who’ll most likely assume she’s still on board with the Biden-Harris foreign policy they’ve come to expect. For now, Harris appears to be treading carefully. She won’t be presiding over or attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial address to Congress on Wednesday, which a number of Democrats are boycotting. She will instead be on the campaign trail and is expected to meet with Netanyahu privately during his visit. It’s a perfect way for her to avoid any polarizing optics — or make clear to anyone exactly where she stands."

The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll, for example, found Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by 4 points, 42% to 38%, with third-party candidates in the mix, and by 2 points, 44% to 42%, in a head-to-head match-up with the former Republican president. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) The latest national NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, meanwhile, showed the Democratic VP tied with Trump in a multicandidate field, and in a head-to-head match-up, the GOP nominee was ahead by the narrowest of margins, 46% to 45%.(Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) It was against this backdrop that one of the former president’s pollsters thought it’d be a good idea to issue a memo on where things currently stand. HuffPost reported: “The coverage will be largely positive and will certainly energize Democrats and some other parts of their coalition at least in the short term,” Fabrizio wrote in his memo. “That means we will start to see public polling — particularly national public polls — where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump.” The document added that Harris is seeing a “bump” in the polls now, and this is likely to “last a while until the race settles back down.” At face value, there’s nothing especially wrong with Fabrizio’s analysis. There’s also no great mystery about the pollster’s motivation: With Biden out of the race and Trump’s advantage in national surveys slipping away, it stands to reason that the Republican’s top polling expert would issue a document that, for all intents and purposes, tells his party — and his client — “Don’t panic. This is temporary.” There is, however, a relevant detail that the memo downplayed: where Team Trump expected to be at this point. Ahead of the recent presidential debate, the GOP nominee was already well positioned in the 2024 race. After the debate, his advantage grew. Then Trump was shot, the former president named his running mate and the Republican National Convention soon followed. Right about now, in other words, most political observers — in both parties — would expect to see Trump’s lead reaching new heights. But it’s not, thanks in part to Biden’s willingness to put the country’s needs first, and in part to Democrats rallying behind Harris with great enthusiasm. The fact that the vice president is getting a “bump” isn’t a huge problem for the Republican ticket and its allies; the fact that Team Trump expected to be riding high as July came to an end, however, is far more significant."
13,"New Republican impeachment measure targets Harris (yes, again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-republican-impeachment-measure-targets-harris-yes-rcna163389,"As this week got underway, House Republicans were all set to add to their rather extraordinary impeachment list. In the wake of the recent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, Rep. Greg Steube of Florida announced plans to file articles of impeachment against Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina soon after took steps to force a vote on the measure. The efforts quickly proved moot: A day later, Cheatle announced her resignation. But impeachment fans didn’t have to wait too long for the GOP to move forward with a related gambit. The conservative Washington Times reported: At the outset, it’s worth emphasizing that the California Democrat has never served as the administration’s “border czar,” no matter how many times Republicans and their allies claim otherwise. But that’s not the only area of concern here. For one thing, as GOP lawmakers really ought to know, impeaching a sitting vice president over policy disagreements is ridiculous. For another, if seeing the words “Ogles,” “Harris” and “impeachment” in the same sentence rings a bell, there’s a good reason for that: This same highly controversial congressman first introduced an impeachment resolution against the vice president last summer. The far-right Tennessean’s measure didn’t go anywhere, so he apparently decided to unveil a new one because —well, just because. But stepping back, there’s a larger context to all of this: Much of the House Republican Conference seems to look at impeachment campaigns as toys to be pulled off the shelf when they’re bored. In fact, it’s time to update the big list: President Joe Biden: There is absolutely no evidence uncovered by Republicans that the incumbent Democrat has actually committed any high crimes, but as of this morning, there are literally seven different impeachment resolutions pending in the House targeting the sitting president. Vice President Kamala Harris: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Harris in the last Congress (I still don’t understand why) and it picked up two co-sponsors. Ogles, meanwhile, has unveiled two resolutions over the last 13 months. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: For the first time in American history, the House voted earlier this year to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary, targeting Mayorkas despite lacking evidence of high crimes. Attorney General Merrick Garland: Several GOP lawmakers, including former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have raised the prospect of impeaching the nation’s chief law enforcement official. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a pending impeachment resolution against Garland a while back, as did Rep. Scott Perry, who also unveiled a similar resolution. Secretary of State Antony Blinken: For reasons that remain fuzzy, Republican Rep. Ralph Norman introduced an impeachment resolution last summer targeting the nation’s chief diplomat. Rep. Dave Schweikert also raised the specter of impeaching Blinken. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin: Nearly a year ago, Rep. Cory Mills of Florida introduced a resolution to impeach the Pentagon chief, and it managed to pick up three GOP co-sponsors. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg: A handful of congressional Republicans have endorsed impeaching Buttigieg, though formal resolutions have not yet been introduced. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona: Though this effort hasn’t yet moved beyond the discussion phase, Cardona is apparently in the mix. The New York Times reported last fall that “some” GOP lawmakers would like to impeach the education secretary. FBI Director Chris Wray: Schweikert also made behind-the-scenes comments suggesting the FBI director handpicked by Trump might face some kind of impeachment threat. Soon after, Greene introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Wray, which has picked up a half-dozen GOP co-sponsors. Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia: Greene, apparently upset about criminal cases against accused Jan. 6 defendants, has also introduced an impeachment resolution going after the federal prosecutor. (It has four Republican co-sponsors.) Taken together, the House Republicans' broader impeachment list now includes the sitting president, sitting vice president, six Cabinet secretaries, the director of the FBI and a largely unknown federal prosecutor. White House spokesperson Ian Sams told NBC News earlier this year, “House Republicans are treating impeachments like an Oprah audience giveaway. They are disregarding the Constitution for the sake of cheap, baseless political stunts, instead of focusing on the issues Americans care about, and it lays bare how extreme they have become.”"
14,Andy Beshear’s perfect response to JD Vance makes his case to be Harris’ running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-24 03:39:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/andy-beshear-kamala-harris-vp-rcna163228,"In early 2023, Kentucky Republicans launched an all-out attack on transgender children, trans families and the state’s broader LGBTQ community. The GOP’s supermajorities in the state House and Senate spent much of that year’s general session constructing and passing Senate Bill 150, one of the most heinous, restrictive, anti-trans bills in the country. One day during this hateful effort, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear traveled to my small, rural town in the middle of his re-election campaign to present a check for tourism and sidewalk improvements near an elementary school.  A standing-room-only crowd gathered in the conference room of our police department. I watched the governor go around and, as he always did, shake every hand. A number of local Republicans chatted as happily with him as everyone else.  When he shook my hand, he smiled and joked, “Long time no see!” as I had just seen him from a distance a few days earlier at the state Capitol, where he’d spoken at a rally for the pro-LGBTQ Fairness Campaign. “You doin’ OK?” he asked. I immediately thought back to some of the truly ignorant legislative committee meetings I’d covered concurrent with that rally, and how many lawmakers appeared, at best, indifferent to the suffering they were about to cause with SB 150. “To be honest, governor,” I replied, “I cried all the way home from the Capitol last Friday.” We talked privately for a few minutes about the bill. Then he looked me in the eye. “Hang in there,” he said with boy-next-door sincerity. “Remember, we are all children of God.” This may sound like an odd conversation for a regular citizen to have with a governor. But I can tell you it felt completely normal to talk to him — to Andy, as Kentuckians began calling him during the pandemic — in this honest, very basic, human way. With Vice President Kamala Harris now the de facto presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, many consider Beshear one of the most likely choices as her running mate. If he can’t deliver Republican-dominated Kentucky — and, let’s be honest, no one could — what does Beshear bring to a national ticket? The basics. His principled rejection of public mudslinging; his active listening skills, positivity and kindness; and his down-to-earth, Mr. Rogers-like ability to communicate with people no matter their party registration, which is how he won re-election. After years of Trumpian lies, fearmongering and divisiveness, I think we are starving for this. And Beshear, unlike former President Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance, has a sense of Kentuckians — and Americans — that goes beyond stereotypes concocted for a book. “I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like because let me just tell you JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said on MSNBC earlier this week. “The nerve that he has to call the people of Eastern Kentucky lazy? Listen, these are the hardworking coal miners that powered the industrial revolution. … We should be thanking them, not calling them lazy.” What Vance — who was raised in Ohio, not Kentucky — has in common with his new boss is that they are both slick, millionaire opportunists who exploit regular working folks.  Despite the bad impression our Republican state legislators create, Kentuckians are some of the most generous, welcoming people you will meet. I was born and raised in Missouri; my husband hails from Indiana. But after our son went to the University of Kentucky, he loved the state so much that he stayed. After a decade in Silicon Valley — where my husband worked in the tech industry and, yes, where JD Vance made his money as a venture capitalist — we wanted to be closer to our family and decided to join our son here. In our first days after moving, our new neighbors threw a picnic bonfire for us in freezing cold January. Beshear reflects that welcoming nature. Long before the GOP’s anti-trans fearmongering in 2023, right-wing activists were circulating a photo of Beshear with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an activist drag troupe, in an effort to hurt him with the Kentucky electorate.  “This is what our Democrat governor is about today,” a Republican state senator claimed. “These are the values that the Democratic Party of today is out there trying to convince our children’s the right way to live.” Conservatives predicted Beshear would run from the photo. Instead, he embraced it. “Everyone in Kentucky counts,” he told a local news station. “I would absolutely take that picture again.” That approach has paid off: In last November’s gubernatorial election, Beshear won with more than 52% of the vote (up from 49% four years earlier). A month before, I received a Facebook message from a prominent, lifelong Republican in my tiny, rural town. “Yes, I am a Republican,” he wrote, “BUT I AM VOTING FOR ANDY. He is what is best for Ky and has done an excellent job as governor.” He would do an excellent job as vice president, too.  Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Josh Shapiro here. "
15,"Team Harris stresses prosecutorial record, calls Trump a criminal",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 11:52:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-harris-prosecutorial-record-calls-trump-criminal-election-2024-rcna164333,"At an event late last week, Donald Trump declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” he said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” In context, Trump appeared to be referring to migrants hoping to enter the United States, but there was a degree of irony hanging overhead. In a little more than a year, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case, a different jury held him liable for sexual abuse, and a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. A little self-awareness goes a long way, and by any reasonable measure, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal” is a phrase the GOP nominee probably ought to avoid. It was against this backdrop that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign made its first big ad buy of the cycle, investing $50 million in support of a spot called “Fearless.” The minute-long commercial is worth watching in its entirety, but of particular interest was the opening message in the spot. “As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,” the narrator tells viewers. “As California’s attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners.” The ad goes on from there, but from the outset, the message was unambiguous: Team Harris wants voters to know about her background in law enforcement, and her role in locking up criminals. A day earlier, the incumbent vice president’s political operation sent a news release to reporters on crime, noting not only the significant improvement in crime rates during the Democratic administration, but also saying plainly: “Our opponent Donald Trump is a criminal.” A campaign spokesperson added, “On crime and the border: Donald Trump’s lies are not facts and Donald Trump’s angry rants are not results. Under Trump, America saw unprecedented violence, ineptitude, and division. Right now, America is stronger and safer because of the work of the Biden-Harris administration: Violent crime is at record lows, the border is more secure, and unlike Donald Trump, the vice president is committed to enforcing the law, not breaking it.” The former president talks about crime as if it’s a campaign issue on which he has an advantage, despite his felonious past. It appears his assumptions are being tested. At a campaign rally last week, Trump told an audience that the Democratic campaign was telling the electorate, “‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’” He added, “I don’t think people are going to buy it.” The trouble, of course, is that the message has the benefit of being true. As for whether voters will buy it or not, we’ll find out in about 98 days."
16,Kamala Harris might have an opening on the economy that Biden didn't,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 07:47:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-poll-economy-inflation-rcna164099,"A number of early surveys measuring the popularity of Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, look promising for her and her party. Several show Harris quickly surpassing President Joe Biden when pitted against former President Donald Trump in the polls. But one data point in particular has me feeling optimistic about Harris’ odds. A snap poll conducted by Democratic pollster Blueprint immediately after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris found that registered voters were split 50-50 on whether she or Trump would do a better job “bringing down prices” on goods and services. “The upside for Harris is huge: Voters do not hold her accountable for Biden’s perceived failures on inflation, and she can run hard on economic messaging,” Blueprint lead pollster Evan Roth Smith told Semafor. To use a Bidenism, this is a big f---ing deal.  Harris coming in even with Trump on inflation might not sound all that positive, but it is. Countless polls have shown that Biden was weak against Trump on the economy, and specifically on inflation. Biden struggled to win back voter trust on the economy, despite the fact that inflation has dissipated, wages have grown and the economy is by many metrics, including the unemployment rate, very strong. It seems that, for at least some of the electorate, the memory of high inflation earlier in Biden’s term stuck to him and was hard to shake off, particularly as housing inflation remains high.  But it looks like Harris might have a chance to instantly shed Biden’s second-biggest political liability — behind only questions about his mental acuity. Harris getting an opportunity to reset the Democrats on the economy is an especially big deal because it looms particularly large in the eyes of undecided voters who could play a decisive role in the election. While Biden’s ""defense of democracy"" narrative played well with the plugged-in Democratic base, less politically engaged voters are more focused on their pocketbooks. If Harris is seen as either not responsible for or less responsible for inflation, it could make them more receptive to her pitch on economic issues. Republicans are starting to roll out attacks on Harris as liable for inflation during Biden’s term; it’s unclear how much of it will stick. Inflation has been notably absent from Harris’ opening case to voters in speeches and her first campaign video. It’s possible she wants to avoid drawing attention to the issue during the initial phase of her campaign, during which she wants to focus in positive terms about her vision for the country and exploit a honeymoon period with the press and the electorate.  But she won’t be able to avoid it indefinitely. Harris will need to settle upon strategies for discussing the Biden administration’s record on the issue; unveil her policy plan to address concerns that some costs remain too high (especially housing) or fears that high inflation could return; and determine whether she will home in on Trump’s extremist tariff plans as inflationary. There are no easy answers here, as the Harris campaign will have to balance trying to focus on narratives that most naturally play to her strengths against addressing voter concerns. But her performance in the polls suggest that there’s a window for her to make a case that Biden couldn’t."
17,Arizona mayor becomes the latest Republican to back Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 06:42:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizona-mayor-becomes-latest-republican-back-harris-rcna164241,"Vice President Kamala Harris picked up endorsements this week from several mayors of border towns in Arizona, but one new endorsement from the Grand Canyon State stood out from the rest. John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona’s third-largest city, endorsed the Democrat in an op-ed for The Arizona Republic, despite the fact that Giles is a Republican. The mayor described Harris as “the competent, just and fair leader our country deserves,” while describing Trump as “a felon” and “a serious threat to our nation.” Giles went on to write, “I believe my party has a moral and ethical responsibility to restore faith in our democratic institutions. In the spirit of the late Sen. John McCain’s motto, ‘Country First,’ I call on other Arizona Republicans to join me in choosing country over party this election and to vote against Donald Trump.” This announcement comes on the heels of a similar endorsement from former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a lifelong Republican who threw his support behind Harris last week. For the vice president, this isn’t a bad start. After all, Harris has only been a candidate for nine days, and given the state of the cotemporary GOP, it’s not easy for any Democratic candidate to pick up cross-party backing. Looking ahead, though, it’s only natural to wonder whether Giles and Duncan represent the start of a trend or whether they’ll be 2024 outliers. Before President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, he’d picked up some Republican backing, including a high-profile endorsement from former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson also encouraged people to vote for the Democratic incumbent, and former deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews made a similar announcement. As best as I can tell, they haven’t yet thrown their support behind Harris, though it wouldn’t come as too big of a surprise if they did. But will other Republicans follow suit? I kept a close eye on this dynamic four years ago and found quite a few GOP partisans — former Republican National Committee chairs, former Republican cabinet secretaries, former Republican governors and former Republican members of Congress — who publicly expressed support for the Biden-led Democratic ticket. As Election Day 2024 approaches, they are likely to face some pressure to do the same this year. Watch this space."
18,‘Duckin’ Don’: Team Harris ridicules Trump over new debate dodge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 06:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/duckin-don-team-harris-ridicules-trump-new-debate-dodge-2024-election-rcna164227,"It was nearly three months ago when Donald Trump and his campaign team agreed to participate in some presidential debates, including an event on Sept. 10, shortly before early voting begins in some states. At the time, of course, the Republican and his political operation assumed he’d share a stage with President Joe Biden. They now know better — and their willingness to honor the original schedule is, at a minimum, in flux. Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed-upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’d been a candidate for less than a week. The likely Democratic nominee went a little further yesterday, explaining that she will, in fact, be on the stage for the event, whether her GOP rival agrees to participate or not. “We’ll see if Trump shows,” Harris’ spokesperson added. As things stand, the odds of Trump agreeing to another general election debate aren’t great. The Associated Press reported on the former president’s latest comments on the subject, aired last night on Fox News. Fox’s Laura Ingraham pressed him on this point several times, and the Republican nominee kept hedging. Trump said he “likes” debating and “wants” to debate Harris, before adding, “But I also can say this: Everybody knows who I am.” When the host asked, “Why not debate her?” Trump didn’t contest the premise of the question. He instead replied, “Because [voters] already know everything.” The former president added that if he agreed to the Sept. 10 debate, it would “reward fake news,” and he’s against making ABC News “rich.” These were not the words of someone who seems eager to share a debate stage with Harris. With this in mind, let’s recap recent events. July 21: Within hours of Biden ending his 2024 candidacy, Trump started hedging on a possible debate and complaining about ABC News, despite the fact that his campaign team had already agreed to have ABC News host the next event. July 23: Trump doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later in the day, he told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate Harris, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything.” July 25: Aides to Trump said they wouldn’t commit to another debate. July 29: Trump appeared on Fox News and hedged some more, arguing that he “can also make a case for not doing it.” After the interview aired, the Harris campaign issued a press release with a headline that referred to the former president as “Duckin’ Don.” The statement from the vice president’s spokesperson added, “Why won’t Donald Trump give a straight answer on debating Vice President Harris? It’s clear from tonight’s question-dodging: He’s scared he’ll have to defend his running mate’s weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president. Vice President Harris will be on the debate stage September 10th. Donald Trump can show up, or not.” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
19,Kamala Harris got Democrats excited. Mark Kelly can help them win.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-running-mate-arizona-vet-mark-kelly-rcna164194,"The last few weeks have given the country a massive dose of perspective. From the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden’s stepping aside, politicians and voters have endured weeks of political turmoil.   Now, with the Democratic nomination in her sights, all eyes turn to Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate search.  Outside of finding a Republican like former Rep. Adam Kinzinger or an unaffiliated leader like Adm. William McRaven, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is the best pick for the Democrats — especially if they want to attract incredibly important independent voters. First off, Kelly is a Navy combat pilot with significant military experience. That is big. Plus, he’s an astronaut, which means bipartisan respect and exciting star power (and cool stories). He’s more than prepared to be commander in chief if called upon. But despite his decades of leadership, Kelly isn’t a Washington insider.  Kelly is from Arizona, of course, and would bring a somewhat maverick spirit to the ticket in the style of fellow Arizonan John McCain. He is married to the universally beloved and politically experienced former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He’s a straight, white, tough man who can talk guns, abortion and the border, and he is moderate by modern Democratic Party standards — which is critical.  I’ve met Kelly; he’s the real deal as a human. He would be a powerful contrast to the sketchiness of Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. And both Vance and Trump would have a hard time landing blows against this American hero.  Overall (and perhaps most of all), Kelly is the closest to an independent or Republican option among the reported finalists. That may not make the more progressive wing of the party happy, but ultimately the trade-off should be worth it.   In 2020, Democrats did the right thing to win. They picked Biden over some of the more progressive options like Sen. Bernie Sanders and selected Harris for balance. She was a key part of a ticket that needed to mobilize and inspire.  This year is different. Many Democrats are already excited about Harris’ surprise top billing. Some Republicans are, too. But emotion isn’t enough. In June, before Biden stepped aside, polls showed that a quarter of Americans had unfavorable views of both candidates. In 2022, the majority of millennials and Gen Zers old enough to vote identified as independent — a significant antiestablishment rebellion that shows no signs of reversing. At the end of this month, Gallup reported that 41% of all respondents identified as “independent.” (Of these independent respondents, slightly more lean Republican than Democrat.) Winning over these millions of independent-minded voters — especially in swing states — could very well determine the outcome of the election. I didn’t think Harris was Democrats’ best option to replace Biden, especially in the context of an increasingly independent voting population. And she still has some very key weaknesses — namely a lack of military experience and high negatives with both independents and Republicans — that must be offset.  More than any other option floated, Capt. Mark Kelly offsets those weaknesses. Harris is clearly getting Democrats excited. But adding Kelly would mean maybe they can win. Just maybe. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here and the case for Josh Shapiro here."
20,This billionaire Democrat’s brazen suggestion puts Kamala Harris in a lose-lose situation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-30 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-linkedin-reid-hoffman-ftc-chair-lina-khan-rcna163897,"LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has a request for Vice President Kamala Harris, should she become president: replace Lina Khan as head of the Federal Trade Commission. Khan is “waging war on American business,” he told CNN last week. Hoffman, to be clear, is not just another man with an opinion. The billionaire and political megadonor donated $10 million to the Biden-Harris campaign, pushed his peers to do the same and is planning on a major fundraising push in Silicon Valley for Harris. And his public demand to oust Khan is the latest sign America’s billionaires need to be reminded that government policy shouldn’t be dictated by those with the largest checkbook.   The Biden administration has been the most pro-worker and pro-consumer presidential administration in decades. That charge has been led, in part, by Khan. In her tenure as FTC chair, Khan has spearheaded efforts to block mergers that could result in monopolies in sectors ranging from big tech to grocery stores, and she has stood up for worker rights by moving to ban widely reviled noncompete agreements. It’s no surprise then that after Hoffman made his demand, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the Service Employees International Union came to Khan’s defense. This is a very democratic — with a small d — agenda. It is about freedom — the freedom to start a business and not worry about anti-competitive practices from deep-pocketed rivals, the freedom from unaccountable businesses that have no market incentives to worry about the needs and rights of their customers, and the freedom for workers to move jobs as they wish. It also happens to be a popular agenda — that is, with everyone but the most powerful. Khan’s pro-consumer, pro-worker, anti-monopoly agenda has attracted no small amount of hate from powerful and monied interests. Since Khan became FTC chair just over three years ago, the Wall Street Journal opinion page has printed more than 100 opinion pieces ranting about her record — an average of one screed every 11 days. Billionaires regularly take to CNBC to complain about her record; on Monday, media mogul Barry Diller referred to her as “a dope” and said that, if Harris wins, he would lobby her for Khan’s removal. These plutocrats are speaking up, in part, because Harris’ opinions on Khan are largely unknown. But their opening and influence would be much less if it wasn’t for our campaign financing system, which privileges access to money over the power of the ballot box. A study by Martin Gilens at Princeton University and Benjamin Page at Northwestern University confirmed that government action is much more likely to reflect the wants and sentiments of wealthy Americans and corporate interests than actual majority sentiment. Americans hate this reality. It’s a large part of why former President Donald Trump was able to ride “drain the swamp” to the White House in 2016. But it’s also a part of the reason he got tossed in 2020. Instead of draining the swamp, he appointed the wealthiest Cabinet in American history and opened up the spigots for those who sought to influence his administration. But the power of the corporate purse also helps explain why Democrats quickly embraced any business leader who spoke up and took on Trump. Seeking allies against Trump, it was a natural next step to elevate prominent business leaders who said they didn’t support his administration or re-election. Anti-Trump forces even celebrated Elon Musk when he resigned from a Trump business advisory council after the former president walked away from the Paris climate accords. As we know, Musk soon resumed his right-ward trajectory. Others who were quick to condemn Trump in the wake of Jan. 6, have also made their way back to supporting the former president, seemingly because he’s promising tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Money talks in both our culture and, the more money, the louder the voice. Take, for example, how voter concerns about Biden’s advanced age were largely ignored — until, that is, his shocking June debate performance led donors who had previously backed Biden’s re-election effort to shut their wallets. As for Trump, he barely mentions “drain the swamp” these days. He instead is campaigning on a grab bag of grievances, even as he privately visits major donors, tin cup in one hand and a for-sale sign in the other. Earlier this year, according to The Washington Post, he all but promised to do away with a laundry list of policies and regulations reviled by the fossil fuel companies if, in turn, their executives raised $1 billion for his campaign. All this explains why the wealthiest Americans are increasingly used to getting their way no matter what party is in charge — and why they are so quick to get offended when thwarted.   Hoffman’s got other beefs too — he’s also made it known he would like to see tariffs imposed under both Trump and Biden rolled back. Taken together, this brazenness leaves Harris in a terrible position. While she should keep Khan on, if she wins and decides, for whatever reason, to replace the current FTC chair, it will look like she is doing the bidding of billionaires. Calls for Harris to return Hoffman’s money, on the other hand, don’t solve the underlying problem either. Not only would it be hard to know what to give back, but Hoffman's case raises contributions from many other donors. And the real issue is that the legalized corruption that is the U.S. campaign financing system is hardly a way to run an effective and democratic government. Until that changes, nothing else will. "
21,Excitement over Kamala Harris dims GOP's post-convention glow,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 12:57:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/harris-trump-enthusiasm-battleground-2024-rcna164057,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""Morning Joe."" President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race completely shook up what should have been the Republican Party’s post-convention glow. While Donald Trump did see a polling bump, as you would expect following a party’s convention, that wasn’t the story making headlines last week. No one was talking about what was discussed at the Republican National Convention.  Instead, the national conversation quickly moved past the convention and the focus shifted to the future: Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy.  Last week, for the first installment of Morning Joe’s 2024 presidential election focus groups, we visited the purple state of Wisconsin, where less than 30,000 votes determined the winner of around a dozen elections since 2000.  Campaigns use focus groups to test candidates, policy positions, and political messages. Focus groups are crucial because in order to win elections, you have to understand the voters. During my conversations, I noticed how different the energy was among voters last week, compared to when I was in Wisconsin just six weeks earlier.   Six weeks ago, Democratic voters were depressed. Now they’re energized. They might have some qualms about Harris, and she may not have been their first choice — but she is now. Democrats are in and they’re activated.  That isn’t to say Trump doesn’t also have enthusiastic supporters. We saw that fervor on full display at the RNC. But now, the test will be whether Democrats can match and sustain that enthusiasm this time around."
22,How Kamala Harris is using Republicans' favorite rhetorical tricks against them,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 09:20:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-speech-freedom-trump-republicans-rcna163823,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign message is clear: She loves freedom and Donald Trump is weird. In the week since President Joe Biden dropped out and the vice president became the front-runner, she has upended the Democrats' campaign messaging, adding a sharp-edged contrast that borrows a lot from typically Republican rhetoric. Instead of Biden's more earnest approach, her campaign has leaned heavily into simple words with powerful emotional appeals. In her first campaign ad, she recast the Democratic agenda as centered on ""freedom,"" saying the word four times to highlight her support for workers (""the freedom not just to get by, but get ahead""), gun safety laws (""the freedom to be safe from gun violence"") and access to abortion (""the freedom to make decisions about your own body""). In case you somehow missed the message, the minute-long ad is set to Beyoncé's 2016 song ""Freedom,"" which repeats the word another 10 times. She also used the word a dozen times in her short speech at the Democratic campaign headquarters in Delaware, tying it into a broader historical narrative that included bolstering the ""sacred freedom to vote"" on her agenda. ""Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedom,"" she told the gathering of campaign staffers and volunteers. ""Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom from our founders to our framers, to the abolitionists and the suffragettes, to the freedom riders and farmworkers. And now I say team, the baton is in our hands."" In Harris' current campaign, ""freedom"" is favored instead of the more typical Democratic rhetoric about ""reproductive rights"" or ""the right to vote."" She's even recast labor rights as ""the freedom to join a union."" In doing so, she's reclaiming a word that the right has so dominated in recent years that an arch-conservative group in the House simply calls itself the Freedom Caucus. At the same time, the Harris campaign and its Democratic allies have made a sharp turn away from Biden’s serious approach in describing Trump world, adopting a more mocking tone. In a news release, the Harris campaign trolled the former president by saying that “Trump is old and quite weird.” After Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a potential running mate, posted a viral tweet calling Trump ""weird"" for a campaign speech riff on the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, he repeated the word multiple times in an MSNBC interview. For good measure, the Harris campaign also called Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, ""weird and creepy"" over old remarks in which he proposed stopping women from traveling across state lines to get an abortion. In both cases, the strategy is reminiscent of Trump's messaging: pick a simple theme and repeat it over and over and over, like his nicknames ""Crooked Hillary"" Clinton, ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi"" and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden or his promise to ""build the wall"" and ""make America great again."" It's also reminiscent of an approach pioneered by former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich. In 1990, a political organization with ties to him sent a memo to Republican candidates who wanted to ""speak like Newt,"" urging them to describe themselves with positive words like ""freedom,"" ""courage"" and ""strength"" and their opponents with negative words like ""bizarre,"" ""pathetic"" and ""sick."" (The memo even suggested calling rivals ""traitors,"" although in a moment that now feels quaint, the group's head told The New York Times that was a mistake.) The words underscored Gingrich's scorched-earth approach to politics by clearly marking out tribal lines: Your campaign represented all that was good and normal, while your opponents were weirdos who would destroy society if given power. It also made sense, given the starkly different demographics of the two major parties. With a base of college-educated voters, young people and minorities, Democrats are much less judgmental and even embrace being a little offbeat, as shown by things like the famous slogan ""Keep Austin Weird."" With a more homogenous base of voters, Republicans found it easy to single out a Democratic-leaning demographic for ridicule, casting random people like a pro-LGBTQ teacher or Black Lives Matter activist as being outside of the mainstream. Trump regularly called Democrats ""crazy,"" ""pathetic,"" ""sick,"" ""weird"" and ""ridiculous."" But in an ironic twist, all that tribalism made Republicans vulnerable to the same attack. Over the last three decades, many conservatives have become increasingly skeptical of mainstream media, burrowing deeper into alternatives peddled by the likes of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. With little pushback in these echo chambers and gerrymandered House districts, their ideas became increasingly extreme. Vance is a case study in this. His proposal to give parents more votes than adults who don't have children came from a speech at a conservative organization, and his attack on ""childless cat ladies"" on Carlson's now-canceled Fox News show. His idea of stopping women from crossing state lines for an abortion was aired on a far-right podcast and later followed up by a lobbying effort to allow police to access women’s health records. In a telling moment on that podcast, Vance described a bizarre hypothetical in which conservative bogeyman George Soros would send 747s full of Black women seeking abortions from Ohio to California. ""That’s kind of creepy, right?"" he told the host. Of course, Vance meant that his outlandish scenario would be creepy if it came to pass, but since nothing remotely like it is happening, he's the one who ends up seeming outside the mainstream. And with its new focus on calling Republicans ""weird,"" the Harris campaign is determined to let the rest of America know that, too."
23,Kamala Harris ought to take the long view on her VP pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-29 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-vice-president-vp-choice-rcna163723,"Vice President Kamala Harris has rapidly emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now, the party is consumed with the next big question: Who should be her running mate? The prevailing wisdom in these debates, as articulated by countless pundits and political junkies, is that a presidential candidate must snag a VP who can “balance out the ticket” and ideally help secure a battleground state. In countless columns and social media posts, candidates are chiefly assessed — often through reference to brief cable news clips — on how they could help Harris edge out former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance on Election Day. I hope that the Harris camp does not succumb to such shallow and shortsighted thinking. Data gathered by political scientists indicates that VP picks have a very limited impact on the appeal of a presidential ticket. What matters most in the long term is recognizing how likely it is that a vice president could become a presidential candidate or president one day — and what this person might do with that power. The veepstakes is perhaps the ultimate catnip for pundits and political junkies in every presidential cycle, spurring innumerable takes on how a specific VP’s home state, rhetorical style, race, gender and vibe might complement the presidential candidate and help win over key constituencies. But political scientists have found that VP picks don't make much of a difference when it comes to elections. Take the claim that selecting a vice president can help a president secure the state they hail from in the election, which is central to the argument that a VP should come from a battleground state. The political scientists Kyle Kopko and Christopher Devine, who specialize in the electoral impact of vice presidential picks, studied over a century of election and voter data and found “a vice presidential candidate’s state of residence generally has no effect on how a presidential candidate performs in that state. The vice presidential home state advantage is, essentially, zero.” The one exception they found was that a VP pick from a state with a small population and who has established an exceptional reputation as “an institution in state politics” could confer some home-state advantage to the presidential ticket. But a small state is, by definition, rarely going to be a game changer in the Electoral College. (Moreover, most battleground states today are not small.) Kopko and Devine have also pointed out that there is little evidence that vice presidents deliver specific demographic groups. “We didn’t find evidence, for example, that Geraldine Ferraro or Sarah Palin attracted more women voters to their party’s ticket,” Kopko recently told The New Republic. “Nor did Mike Pence attract more evangelical voters.” They have found one exception to that trend: Harris, as Biden’s running mate, did have a measurable impact on the vote choice of Black, women and Black women voters. But that being said, the effect was very small, and may have been amplified by a perception of Biden as unusually old and/or a potential one-term president meant to take down then-President Trump. While data suggests that people’s vote choice or likelihood is rarely affected by a VP pick, Kopko and Devine have found that the nature of the choice does, to some extent, affect voter perception of the presidential candidate. So while Palin did not win women for Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008, she did dampen voter perception of his age and judgment. To be fair, there is an argument to be made that Harris’ VP pick matters more in this cycle than most because of the exceptional nature of her candidacy. Assuming she secures the nomination, she will have a strikingly short period of time to introduce herself as a presidential candidate, and perhaps her running mate will play a larger role in defining her campaign as a result. But while we cannot rule out the electoral significance of a VP pick at the margins in a tight race, those considerations must be weighed against something we know matters: A vice president is unusually likely to become a viable presidential candidate or president in the future. Close to one-third of U.S. presidents have served as vice presidents before. That's not including the vice presidents who have become a nominee and failed. The last and current election cycles alone are a reminder of how much vice presidents matter as potential future leaders. In the 2020 Democratic primaries, Biden’s name recognition and background as Barack Obama’s vice president were indispensable to his performance in national polls and securing key endorsements, which is why he became the establishment candidate that moderates consolidated behind and he won the nomination. And Harris is now the front-runner to win the nomination because she is effectively fulfilling her vice presidential duty as a backup president, and because she represents the simplest route to party unity. This is why Harris should take the long view in her selection. Asking “What kind of potential presidential candidate or president would this person be?” helps train the eye on qualities such as a running mate’s demonstrable competence and their ideological positions. Does a governor or lawmaker have a track record of getting things done legislatively or changing the way people think about policy? Do they know how to lead and generate a mandate? Do they have dexterity with coalition-building? Do their values and their attitudes toward American politics and economics match the direction of the party and the country? Do they have an instinct and a vision for how to push the country forward? Their charisma matters, but it should not be viewed purely through the prism of their serving as a perfect “attack dog” VP. This person could one day be an attack dog for the entire party. I prefer vice presidential picks who understand the Democratic Party is becoming more progressive and exhibit ambition toward that end. Politicians who can think not just technocratically but also about systems, and recognize we live in a populist moment where many people are craving sweeping change. It is all the more imperative as the next generation of MAGA politicians takes up somewhat more left-leaning economic positions which sporadically show openness to regulation and quasi-labor-friendly policy. Democrats should elevate leaders who can vigorously identify capitalist exploitation, elucidate the meaning of social democracy and can call out the ruse of right-wing populism. Incidentally, these kinds of politicians are often the kinds of people who give off good vibes on television — because they have their finger on the pulse of the country. A serious party would seek to elevate them."
24,"Stop being a Debbie Downer. Democrats need to lock in support for Harris, not step on it.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-28 07:16:00,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-harris-enthusiasm-carville-100-days-rcna163848,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 26 episode of “Morning Joe.” During an appearance on “The Beat,” veteran Democratic strategist James Carville told Ari Melber that members of his party were too enthusiastic about the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris: Gee, why such a Debbie Downer? The overwhelmingly positive response to the Harris candidacy is its own cause for celebration among Democrats who have been concerned by the state of the race for months. A strong campaign team can make great television ads or build a great field organization, but it can’t manufacture enthusiasm for your candidate. A fired-up base of supporters is the fuel that propels the most successful campaigns and — as one of the most heralded political strategists of the last three decades — Carville certainly knows this. I guess he’s just nervous about the onslaught of attacks that await the vice president.   You can be both enthusiastic about the Democrats’ new ticket and clear-eyed about the challenges Harris and her running mate will face. As someone who was on the front lines of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, I know I am. It’s going to get ugly and it’s going to be a slog, which is all the more reason why the vice president needs joyful warriors who will have her back during the brutal days ahead. So don’t be a buzzkill. We all need some positive vibes. Knowing of Carville’s anxiety about “preachy females” in the Democratic Party, I also have to wonder if his lamentations about Harris supporters being “giddy” and feeling “liberated” are directed at voters he assumes are elated by the notion of electing the first woman president. That’s not my motivation, nor was it during the 2016 campaign. I just thought Clinton was the best person for the job — which is how I feel this time with Harris. And I think women are extremely motivated to help the vice president now because our lives and those of our daughters and granddaughters are the most threatened by Donald Trump’s extreme agenda. I know firsthand the despair and disempowerment women have felt as we watched polls slip away toward a Trump landslide win. They had left us wondering if we had any agency in this country at all. Was it too late to save democracy or protect the young women and girls in this country? Now, we have a fighting chance to win. I think it’s that hope, that belief that it’s not too late and that there is something each of us can do to ward off a Trump win and secure victory for Harris that accounts for the massive show of support from women and men. Less than a week into her campaign, women and men both have undertaken historic organizing efforts and raised millions of dollars for her. The vice president has shown she’s more than ready for this fight, and that’s inspired us to rally behind her in a very big way. We feel a responsibility to get her elected and empowered to get the job done. Given the dark weeks that preceded this moment, it feels liberating."
25,Why Trump’s attacks on Kamala Harris will be much nastier than usual,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-28 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-attacks-racism-sexism-rcna163313,"We’re 100 days out from the general election, and if you think Kamala Harris’ candidacy as the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee is unprecedented, wait until you see the unprecedentedly vicious and ugly attacks against her. Of course, former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are always nasty work; that’s to be expected from a loud-mouthed, racist, sexist, petty, congenital liar of a candidate. But Trump has always singled out Black women for his most denigrating abuse. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of misogynoir, which describes the coupled misogyny and racism thrown at Black women, please familiarize yourself, stat, because this election season will be lousy with it. Now that the felonious ex-president must face off against Harris — a biracial Black woman and erstwhile prosecutor nearly 20 years his junior — we’re already seeing disgusting assaults on the vice president’s character that aren’t remotely based in fact. Remember those vile T-shirts, popular with Trump’s supporters earlier in the campaign, that read, “Joe and the Ho Gotta Go”? Expect even more hypersexualization toward Harris by Trump, his surrogates and his MAGA followers. They’re alleging Harris “slept her way to the top” — as Megyn Kelly claimed — referencing her relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who had been separated from his wife for over a decade when he and Harris dated 30 years ago. Those falsehoods are also being paired with claims that Harris is a “DEI hire,” a repurposing of “diversity, equity and inclusion” favored by conservatives who are too media-savvy to use overt slurs. Before becoming multiple firsts as vice president and in Congress, Harris was elected the first woman, first African American and first South Asian attorney general in California history, and served as San Francisco’s first woman and nonwhite district attorney. Her track record easily beats the allegations, but when she proves her rhetorical and intellectual competence against Trump, which will be fun to watch, they’ll try to portray her as a “typical angry Black lady.” These bad-faith allegations will be lodged by people who believe Blackness and womanness, regardless of resume, are inherent markers of unfitness. The terms “militant,” “radical,” “California socialist” and “Marxist” will be in heavy rotation, and Trump’s team will claim Harris, as president, will defund every police department and encourage mass migration to let undocumented immigrants vote in elections for Democrats. Just this week, in fact, Trump advisers boasted to The Bulwark of their strategic plan to “Willie Horton” Harris, a reference to racist campaign ads during the 1988 presidential campaign appealing to white panic over perceptions of Black criminality, which portrayed then-Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as lenient on violent offenders. That messaging will go hand in hand with fearmongering about immigration, with the GOP repeatedly claiming Harris failed as the Biden administration’s “border czar” — a title she never held, which the GOP made up and a complicit media helped proliferate. Numerous Republicans have filed impeachment articles against Harris since she became the presumptive nominee, and they’ll continue in this vein because their base loves a good show, however performative. Their own party thwarted a border security bill early this year because Trump wanted to run on immigration chaos. In any case, border crossings have fallen hugely in recent months, and currently stand near where they were in the final months under Trump’s watch. The Republican Party’s boundless hypocrisy means they’ll contradict themselves at every turn. The same partisans who wanted you to believe Harris slept her way to the top of a major-party ticket will also portray her as a childless, careerist feminazi whose hatred for America’s family model is surpassed only by her passion for funding post-birth abortions. Regardless of how she handles the Israel-Hamas war, some of the same Republicans known to dabble in antisemitism will claim Harris — the first Biden administration official to call for a cease-fire, but also a consistent defender of Israel’s “right to defend itself” — is stridently anti-Jewish. While using a super-racist nickname like, say, “Kamala X,” they’ll insist her Jamaican and Indian immigrant parentage makes her neither Black nor American — a reconfiguring of the racist “birtherism” directed at President Barack Obama. (Misogynoir being what it is, they may also falsely suggest, as they do with former first lady Michelle Obama, that she isn’t really a woman.) She’ll be cast as lax on crime, but also labeled “Kamala the cop,” and since they think Black people are gullible, criminal morons, Trump will trot out rappers while surrogates celebrate his felonies as proof he’s Blacker than Harris. Vivek Ramaswamy and every Black Republican will obligingly repeat these lines to defang any racism accusations. But the most insidious claim of all will be that Harris cannot win. Not only will this messaging come from Trump and Co., but also from lots of other sources. Paid disinformation agents in Russia, which targeted Black voters most intensely in 2016. Red-pilled American trolls clad in digital blackface. And it’ll come from mainstream reporters concern-trolling about her campaign’s divisiveness, or a New York Times article where rural diner patrons are polled on the “scariest” things about Kamala Harris. The result will be a lot of people saying they want to vote for Harris, but they worry that no one else will. But the stats are currently on Harris’ side. In the 48 hours after Harris became the Dems’ presidential nominee, ActBlue raised $81 million, one of its highest one-day tallies in history. Politico reported that during the first 48 hours of her candidacy, Vote.org saw a 700% spike in voter registrations, which outpaces the increase that resulted from a Taylor Swift social media post. Calls organized for Black women, South Asian women, white women, Latinas, Black men and Black LGBTQ men have raised funds and helped galvanize those communities. Harris’ support among Black and Hispanic voters has bested that of Biden’s, by 8% and 6%, respectively. Polls can be fickle things, but the first Reuters/Ipsos poll since Harris became the candidate has her leading Trump, 44% to 42%. The point is, she can absolutely win. Over the next 100 days, we’re going to see horrifying levels of racism and sexism — misogynoir, that is — and it will be terrifyingly mainstream. But don’t give up hope. Vice President Harris has what it takes to beat back those representing the worst instincts of America. She just needs our votes to make it happen."
26,The polls send a clear message about Kamala Harris. But that’s not the full story.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-27 09:21:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/can-kamala-harris-beat-donald-trump-polls-rcna163225,"When President Joe Biden announced that he had chosen to drop out of the race after a messy debate performance followed by an equally chaotic month, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee in his stead, Harris quickly racked up endorsements from major party figures and a majority of delegates. Barring any major development, she will be the Democratic nominee this fall. Many Democrats saw this passing of the baton as a key moment to redefine a campaign in which the president had been lagging behind. For months, former President Donald Trump had led Biden in polling, both nationally and especially in critical swing states needed to win the presidency. Now an important question arises: Is Harris a stronger candidate than Biden? Ever since Harris’ kickoff of her 2020 presidential campaign, there have been a number of concerns that she would not be a particularly strong candidate. In fact, her campaign ended before the Iowa caucuses, which critics point to as an example of her weakness as a candidate. And her performance in polls against Trump often trailed behind other Democrats’, including Biden’s. But as the 2024 campaign ramped up, there were signs of Harris’ increasing strength — or perhaps Biden’s growing vulnerabilities. Last fall, a New York Times/Siena College poll found Harris slightly outpolled Biden in swing states, thanks to her relative strength with Democratic-leaning groups with whom Biden had shown unprecedented weaknesses. These voters, often young and nonwhite, backed Democratic candidates for Congress and Harris, but not Biden. In the 2020 primary, Biden often outperformed all of his rival Democrats in polls against Trump. But after Biden’s June debate performance, a flurry of polls that measured both Biden and Harris have been decidedly more mixed. For our analysis, we will examine seven post-debate national polls that were conducted by “select pollsters” that meet The New York Times’ standard  for high-quality analysis, plus an additional national poll conducted by Split Ticket/Data for Progress. Of these eight, Harris outperformed Biden in two, ran even with him in two, but performed worse than him in four. Only one poll found the difference between the candidates to be greater than 2 points in either direction. On the state level, what limited evidence we have is similarly mixed. The New York Times and Siena College conducted a poll in Pennsylvania and Virginia that found Harris outrunning Biden by 2 points in both states. An Emerson College poll of Virginia, however, found no difference between the candidates. Unfortunately, those three polls are the extent of high-quality state polls since the June 27 debate. From the polls reviewed, it can be concluded that Harris performs better than Biden, particularly due to strength with young voters and nonwhite voters, two Democratic-leaning groups that have been hesitant in supporting the president but not in their support for the vice president (and some other Democrats). Despite this small polled overperformance, Harris, like Biden, still polls behind Trump. In the past few weeks, Trump led Biden in polls of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, albeit narrowly, while in Sun Belt states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, Trump’s advantage ballooned out into the upper single digits, thanks to his newfound polled strength with previously Democratic nonwhite voters. Even if Harris gained a point or two over Biden in all six states, she would still be reliant on a narrow path to the presidency that is conditional on sweeping the three Midwest swing states. But Harris gaining equally in all six states is not likely; in fact she is more likely to gain in the Sun Belt, where disaffected Democrats are younger and less white than in the Rust Belt. This makes any coalitional gains for her even less efficient than they might appear. More specifically, even if Harris’ strength with these disengaged voters is real, she would have an outsize impact only in the states where Biden’s numbers have already put Democrats in a very weak position. A surge in nonwhite support would, by contrast, have a far more limited effect in Michigan or Wisconsin, meaning Harris may be put in a position where she narrowly falls short of victory in the the Sun Belt despite considerable gains, while the Rust Belt result versus Biden’s hypothetical November performance remains almost unchanged. There’s also a case to be made that the president is the stronger candidate. Although Biden has since bowed out of the race, and almost certainly will not return to the ticket, we shouldn’t ignore some of his unique strengths that Harris may not share. He had already demonstrated his ability to defeat Trump once in 2020; and his poll numbers among white voters and the elderly were on par with those from his 2020 victory — at times, better than what Harris saw. In fact, the groups he had slipped the most with were core Democratic groups, ones that would be most easily goaded back into the coalition as November drew nearer, and the possibility of a second Trump presidency could have been an effective rallying cry for the incumbent president. It is entirely possible that the advantages enjoyed by Harris are simply through winning a greater share of voters who would have “come home” to either candidate. We may never know the answer, but July came to a close with little evidence that these voters had begun the process of returning to Biden — which is why Harris would occasionally outperform him in polls. The strongest case for Biden, then, was that he had already established a “good” baseline among voters least friendly to Democrats, and that his catastrophic numbers with young and nonwhite voters was something of a mirage that would disappear by Election Day. In polling so far, Harris’ strengths relative to Biden’s mostly come from the latter group. Biden also demonstrated regional strength in Northeastern states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Maine, where many counties swung toward Trump in 2016, but then back toward Democrats when Biden was on the ticket in 2020. This helped deliver a decisive win for Biden in states where Hillary Clinton lost or came close to losing in 2016. As a former senator from California, Harris is much less likely to enjoy the same regional advantages Biden did in a part of the country with more swing states. But the case for Harris is less about existing polls, which were asking an entirely hypothetical question of voters up until the Sunday Biden resigned. Instead, Harris gives Democrats an opportunity rarely afforded to a party at this point in the year: a chance to reset the campaign. In fact, Harris’ potential to re-energize disaffected Democrats could also go undetected by polls. Because polls depend on a representative model of the electorate, a poll based on a Biden-Trump model could miss disengaged Democrats who would vote for Harris, but not Biden, potentially understating her true strength with the electorate. These demoralized Democrats could be skipping out on Biden for a number of reasons ranging from his age, which is broadly a concern for all voters, to his handling of the conflict in the Middle East, which is criticized by progressive Democrats, or his association by the electorate with double-digit percentage price increases since his inauguration, which is generally under scrutiny from moderate Democrats. Harris is not fully burdened by these factors, and as a breakout candidate, can more freely define herself to voters across the political spectrum dissatisfied with the Biden presidency. Biden’s campaign had hoped that its poll numbers would turn around as public awareness of Trump’s many liabilities, ranging from election denialism to his dozens of convictions, increased. Instead, the past month has largely revolved around Biden’s age and fitness for office. Harris, at 59, is unlikely to be dogged by this particular issue, and may even be successful in making Trump’s age, at 78, an issue for the former president. But most importantly, Harris can clearly and cogently prosecute the Democrats’ case against Trump, unburdened by Biden’s personal liabilities. She may have a number of her own, and as vice president has already inherited the Biden administration’s unpopularity. It is also possible that she ends up becoming an even less popular figure than Biden, and her strength relative to him revealed to be a mirage. This does not invalidate previous conclusions made from polling top lines, but instead means that Harris may offer Democrats a better chance than Biden to change the party’s polling woes, and to fulfill their original goal of making the election a choice between themselves and Trump — instead of a referendum on Biden. Although a Harris candidacy may introduce more uncertainties to the Democratic ticket, including a yet-unknown vice presidential nominee, when one is falling behind in a contest, the greater variability a fresh face can bring is exactly what’s needed to secure a win."
27,How Kamala Harris should pick her 2024 running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-27 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-pick-vice-president-rcna163892,"There’s no question the Kamala Harris campaign is off to an incredible start. She’s broken fundraising records, already earned nearly every key endorsement from Democratic leadership and launched a fantastic new ad to set the tone. Her next major task? Picking a vice presidential candidate.  There are a lot of names being thrown around as potential running mates, with pundits debating whether she should pick a midwestern governor or border state Democrat to help her campaign in key battleground states.  But beyond all of the whiteboard strategizing, Harris has to ask herself a series of questions: Who does she want to be the first in the room and the last to leave for every major political discussion of her presidency? Who does she want to call from the Oval Office when stuck with a thorny issue? And with just a few months until Election Day, who has their own following, their own ability to fundraise, and their own ability to draw crowds for events?   There is no time for on-the-job training. Whoever Harris picks has to be ready to champion the Democratic ticket from Day Ane. Remember, Donald Trump picked someone who looked great on paper. But as soon as Sen. JD Vance opened his mouth on the campaign trail, things started to go downhill. The Trump campaign has spent this entire election cycle attacking the wrong opponent. And those attacks may now backfire.  The 78-year-old Trump spent a lot of time attempting to portray the 81-year-old President Joe Biden as “too old” to be president. (The maxim, “you only have to be the second-slowest swimmer in the ocean to escape a shark attack” comes to mind.) Harris is 59, meaning the tables have quite literally turned, and all the questions about Biden’s mental acuity will be naturally redirected to Trump. The Trump campaign seems clueless as to how they should go after Harris. So far, Republicans have tried mocking her laugh and clipping her speeches out of context, a strategy which has completely boomeranged. Even Trump is aware he can’t criticize her record as a prosecutor without giving Harris the obvious rebuttal that he was recently convicted by a jury of his peers. Other Republicans have referred to Harris as a “DEI hire,” suggesting she only became the presumptive Democratic nominee because of her race and gender. This racist, sexist dog whistle is so obvious even Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized it. This woman was a prosecutor for two decades before being elected the attorney general of California. She became a United States senator in 2016, gaining notoriety for her tough questioning of judicial nominees and other witnesses in contentious congressional hearings. And for the last three and a half years, she has been vice president of the United States. Contrast that with Trump, who became president after a career spent losing money on real estate and fake firing people on TV.  The “DEI” attacks are also designed to disillusion would-be supporters. As one woman of color told The New York Times this week, “America is just not ready for a woman president — especially not a Black woman president.” But that’s the thing about firsts. They’ve never happened before. Believe me, when I joined the Obama campaign in 2007, plenty of friends and family assumed I would be off the campaign trail within months. Because — and this may sound familiar — the country wasn’t ready to elect a Black president.  In a new op-ed for the Times, Hillary Clinton — herself no stranger to firsts — laid out the challenge for Harris, writing, “While it still pains me that I couldn’t break that highest, hardest glass ceiling, I’m proud that my two presidential campaigns made it seem normal to have a woman at the top of the ticket.” She continued, “Ms. Harris will face unique additional challenges as the first Black and South Asian woman to be at the top of a major party’s ticket…That’s real, but we shouldn’t be afraid. It is a trap to believe that progress is impossible.” Hillary is right. Fear is a trap. And it’s a trap that needs to be called out. There is no time for wallowing. Because even if Mike Johnson and Republican leaders could get their caucus to stop saying the quiet parts out loud and stop taking cheap shots at Harris qualifications, right-wing media pundits aren’t going to get the memo. And neither is the guy at the top of the ticket. As one adviser to Trump told the Bulwark this week, “Trump leads this campaign. So we’re ready for him to call her a DEI hire by Biden.” Republicans are ready, and Democrats should be too. In his Oval Office address Wednesday night, Biden further discussed his vision for the remaining six months of his presidency and promised to “call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy.” While the president has yet to announce any specifics, such a plan may include an enforceable code of ethics, term limits, and perhaps even expanding the number of justices. Additionally, Biden may be considering calling for a constitutional amendment to eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other constitutional officeholders. Of course, those plans face long odds in the Republican-controlled House, and Democrats only hold a slim majority in the Senate. (Although to be clear, roughly two in three Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices.) A constitutional amendment would pose even more challenges, requiring two-thirds support in both chambers and ratification by three fourths of state legislatures.  Biden spent eight years as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and nearly a decade as ranking minority member. It’s safe to say he takes these proposed measures of Supreme Court reform seriously. Clearly, Biden does not intend to have a “lame duck” presidency. NBC News Washington correspondent Yamiche Alcindor has featured prominently in our U.S. Supreme Court this May and June. Now she turns her focus to the Harris campaign. Few journalists are as attuned to the stakes of this election as Alcindor. With her deep understanding of issues like the Supreme Court’s recent presidential immunity ruling and the broader implications of court decisions, she’s uniquely equipped to address the proposed reforms that will be central to the 2024 campaign. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz put it best this week when he posted the following in response to Donald Trump: “Say it with me… Weird.”  I had the pleasure of interviewing Walz this week, and he didn’t hold back."
28,White women fuel yet another fundraising surge for Harris as virtual meetups spread,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 14:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-women-fundraising-democrats-zoom-rcna163871,"In the days since President Joe Biden announced his plans not to seek re-election and Vice President Kamala Harris announced her campaign, a multiracial, multigenerational and gender-diverse coalition of voters have come together for virtual meetups that have fueled a fundraising boom for the Democrats. To me, it has had the feel of an Avengers-like assemblage of all the coalitions Harris will need for a chance to win in November. No, this isn’t the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is Kamala’s Democratic Universe. The fundraising hauls speak to a palpable enthusiasm surrounding the Democratic Party’s de facto presidential nominee. All of the calls have featured a variety of community organizers, celebrities and politicians mobilizing voters to cast ballots for Harris’ ticket this fall. It started Sunday, when Win With Black Women hosted a Zoom call that the group said attracted 44,000 attendees and raised more than $1.5 million. The next day, a group of Black men under a similar banner, Win With Black Men, hosted a call that an organizer said attracted nearly 54,000 attendees and raised $1.3 million. Several more virtual meetups have followed. A Latinas for Harris call on Wednesday reportedly attracted 5,000 attendees and raised $110,000. The same night, a call hosted by South Asian Women for Harris drew 10,000 attendees and raised $285,000, according to an organizer. The latest whopping fundraising haul came Thursday night during a Zoom call intended for white women who support Harris, which an organizer said drew 164,000 participants and raised $2 million. (NBC News hasn’t confirmed these fundraising numbers independently.) And the trend continues. A call was held Thursday for Black gay and queer men supporting Harris, and a similar call was organized for white men. And a national, coalition-wide Women for Harris call has been scheduled for Monday. What a difference a week makes. Democrats had been enduring a storm of defections from Biden, their presumptive presidential nominee. But with Harris, there has been energy surrounding her, interest in her and investment in her — like no other Democrat in recent memory, perhaps other than Barack Obama."
29,"Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris, throwing 'full support' behind her",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 08:44:00,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/barack-michelle-obama-endorse-kamala-harris-rcna163817,"Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 race on Friday. The announcement was posted to the Obamas' social media accounts, accompanied by a video of Harris — the current vice president and de facto Democratic presidential nominee — receiving a call from the Obamas offering their endorsement.  “Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend @KamalaHarris,"" Obama said in his post. ""We told her we think she’ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support. At this critical moment for our country, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you’ll join us.” In the video, Michelle Obama can be heard saying, “I can’t have this call without telling my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.”  In response, Harris thanked them for their friendship over the years. “And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she said in the video. You may have detected a bit of consternation online from people who wondered why this endorsement didn’t come sooner — perhaps, along with the wave of Democratic endorsements that immediately followed President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race. Barack Obama had released a statement soon after Biden announced his intention to drop out that didn’t make any endorsement. Its reference to Obama's ""extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges"" may have suggested to some that he hoped for a brokered convention scenario.  But a source familiar with discussions between Obama and Harris told NBC News that Obama didn't want to overshadow Biden's moment by issuing his endorsement before the president addressed the nation on Wednesday. Whatever the reason for the delay, the Obamas have offered their full-throated support of Harris now. In fact, aides to Obama and Harris have already discussed potential plans for the former president to join the likely nominee on the campaign trail, NBC News reported on Friday, citing three people familiar with the matter."
30,Harris mocks Trump after he hedges (again) on presidential debate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 05:45:00,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-mocks-donald-trump-election-presidential-debate-2024-rcna163777,"The first sign of trouble came on Sunday. Just a few hours after President Joe Biden announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term, Donald Trump quickly turned his attention to one thing: an upcoming presidential debate, which he suddenly seemed reluctant to attend. The Republican published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC in early September, and though Trump and his campaign operation had already agreed to participate in the event, the former president declared on Sunday that he instead wanted a debate on Fox News, instead of a network he described as “fake.” The second sign of trouble came two days later, when the GOP nominee doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later Tuesday, Trump told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate the likely Democratic nominee, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden.” The latest sign of trouble came last night. The New York Times reported: The written statement from Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign’s communications director, was weird, even by 2024 standards. It said there’s “chaos” in Democratic politics (there’s not). It said Biden is corrupt (he isn’t). It suggested Barack Obama opposes Harris (he doesn’t). It suggested it was necessary to use Obama’s middle name (it’s not). It said the opposing party is called the ""Democrat Party"" (it's not). It also said “many” Democrats want to nominate someone other than Harris (they don’t). But after combing through the nonsense, the bottom line was simple: Team Trump concluded that it would be “inappropriate” to “finalize” the existing debate schedule until after the Democratic National Convention. It led the Democratic vice president to respond with a simple and derisive message via social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” It came hours after Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’s only been a candidate for less than a week, and she didn't know why her rival was ""back-pedaling."" Harris’ mockery was rooted in fact. Trump spent the better part of a year begging for debates against Biden, and expressed total indifference to the details. The former president summarized his position in three words: “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” When Biden proposed a pre-convention debate, Trump was only too pleased to agree. The Republican’s position is obviously vastly different now. When we last kicked this around, it seemed as if there were a couple of possible explanations for the antics. One was that Trump was engaged in a mind-numbing “work the refs” exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff. The other possibility is that Trump and his team are simply afraid of how he’d perform against the incumbent vice president. All things considered, the latter explanation appears to be the accurate one. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
31,Kamala Harris has 100 days to make history. Here’s why I think she can do it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,2024-07-26 03:00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-100-day-campaign-history-rcna163541,"In a little over 100 days, Vice President Kamala Harris needs to put together a campaign staff, develop her platform, decide on her strategy, approve advertising and prepare for a possible debate, among other things. It's a daunting set of tasks even when a nominee has months of preparation. But as her former senior adviser and chief spokesperson, I believe she is well-prepared to pull it off. It will not be easy, but it is doable. Look at what she's done so far. In the days since President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed her, the nonpartisan website Vote.org saw 35,000 people register to vote, 83% of them ages 18 to 34. The Harris campaign says it raised an earth-shattering $126 million in three days. The campaign also enlisted thousands of new volunteers, including in crucial swing states such as Nevada, Michigan and Georgia. On Wednesday night, the president appeared on national television behind the Resolute Desk to elaborate on his decision to leave the race and reiterated his support for his governing partner of nearly four years, saying she “is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.” The torch was passed, and now it is up to Harris to take it from here. The first hurdle to clear is reintroducing herself to the American people. Who is she and what does she believe? The campaign has responded so far by reaching back to her start in politics as a prosecutor who took on criminals and rapists, drawing a contrast with Republican nominee Donald Trump. She'll also most likely lean on her experience as vice president. From Day One of the transition, even before we got to the White House, Biden set the tone that his vice president would be in every meeting and she would get all the same materials he received. His directive was there would not be any “silos."" If for some reason we did not have something, all we had to do was ask. Just as President Barack Obama did with him, as their schedules allowed, they would have a private lunch weekly. Every day they were both at the White House, they would receive the Presidential Daily Briefing together. Biden set that tone and, in doing so, laid the groundwork for the surge of possibility and enthusiasm Democrats are experiencing.  Once in office, she was sometimes out of the spotlight, due to the nature of the vice presidency. Frankly, it’s a job few people pay attention to and that the mainstream media apparatus has not covered extensively. So people may be unfamiliar with Harris’ work as the chair of the president’s labor council or her work with the Small Business Administration to increase access to capital for small businesses, especially ones owned by people of color. They may not know her extensive foreign policy engagements with the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine or Central America.  More of them may have heard about her political work. It was the vice president’s emphasis on keeping the government from interfering with women’s bodily autonomy that helped lay the groundwork for the Democratic Party’s success in the 2022 midterms. Her laser focus on the root causes of migration — rather than focusing only on border enforcement, as Republicans tend to do — has helped envision a way to curb the crisis without obscuring the humanity of people braving untold peril in search of a better life. Even from the White House she’s set a record in Congress. As a result of the closely divided Senate, Harris has cast more tiebreaking votes than any of her predecessors. These votes were vital in getting some of the White House’s defining legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, over the finish line. It is a matter of historical fact that she has been one of the most consequential vice presidents the nation has ever seen. The second hurdle for her campaign is slightly more daunting. In order to win, Harris will have to claw back crucial base voters whom past Democratic nominees have been shedding in small but consequential numbers. Black women have been an indispensable voting bloc for the Democratic Party. While the vast majority still vote blue in every presidential election, their numbers have steadily waned since 2012. That year, Black women voted 96% for Obama, followed by 94% for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 90% for Biden in 2020, according to NBC News exit polls. We have seen similar drops among other key voting blocs. On paper, the percentage differences may seem small, but this is going to be a close race. Minor differences in these groups could make a difference in what will be a consequential election. The Harris campaign should treat base voters as persuadable. It is not a foregone conclusion that the diverse coalition of the Democratic Party will turn out simply because the candidate at the top of the ticket has been swapped out. When I worked for the vice president, she often stressed the importance of being straightforward and taking out the fluff. For example, instead of talking in general about the investments in small businesses, she would ask for specific numbers about how many small businesses in a particular state were affected and who they were. She was intentional about making sure people knew when they heard from her that she saw them and that the work spoke directly to them. That is one of Harris’ superpowers.  Beginning a successful presidential campaign roughly 100 days from the election is unheard of in modern American politics, but make no mistake, a lot of history can happen and a lot of odds can be beaten in that time. Allied troops in World War I began an offensive that would result in the end of the Great War 95 days later. In his first 100 days in office, Franklin D. Roosevelt laid the groundwork that would lift America out of the Great Depression. And if Democrats mobilize and America’s electorate turns out, the end of this 100 days could see history made with the first Black woman and woman of South Asian descent elected to the presidency and our democracy preserved once again.
